      <description>Guthrie - Wants first team football on a consistent basis; not happening at NUFC If Danny Guthrie&amp;rsquo;s Twitter account is legit, and it does appear that it is - the Toon midfielder has confirmed that he leaving Newcastle United in the coming weeks, to pursue first team football elsewhere. The centre midfielder, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t managed a consistent role in the midfield this season is eager to play week in week out, and unfortunately, that isn&amp;rsquo;t going to happen at Newcastle United.</description>

      <description>Guthrie - Showed glimpses of real quality today on the ball at Manchester City A spirited defeat at the Etihad Stadium is the only thing you can call it. Two penalties and an individual mistake from Ryan Taylor presented Manchester City with three opportunities that they gladly took, and despite a late goal from Dan Gosling - Newcastle United recorded just their first defeat of the season. A team without Cheik TiotÃ©, Leon Best, and Sylvain Marveaux, who would have all been likely starters, played a very solid first half only for two goals in the space of three minutes to finish off any chances we might have had of winning it.</description>

      <description>Guthrie - Has a bright future under Newcastle United They say he was Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s only signing for Â£2m. He arrived from Liverpool after conceding he couldn&amp;rsquo;t break the first team or compete with the &amp;lsquo;brilliance&amp;rsquo; of Steven Gerrard. Well after arriving from Anfield Guthrie had a mixed start on Tyneside, he broke Craig Fagan&amp;rsquo;s leg before scoring a scorcher against Portsmouth in a memorable victory.Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s be little in the way of media interaction with Danny Guthrie.</description>

      <description>###Â Guthrie - Won&amp;rsquo;t settle until Newcastle are back in Premier League
One man who has been in determined form of late is Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Danny Guthrie. Danny, who was rumoured to be Keegan&amp;rsquo;s only real signing has showed lots of maturity to adjust to the commotion at Newcastle. It&amp;rsquo;s never easy for any player when you play under three different managers in one season and I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find Guthrie is one of them players who is very keen to see Chris Hughton appointed full-time.</description>

      <description>Guthrie - Wants to continue his good form Some say Danny Guthrie was Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s only signing whilst in charge of Newcastle United. However, it was a very good signing indeed. Guthrie who left Liverpool because of Steven Gerrards&amp;rsquo; brilliance, he himself is starting to show similar characteristics of the Liverpool captain. Although not a regular, when we were in the Premier League, Guthrie played well any time he came no or started.</description>

      <description>Well in what was quiet an exciting game to say the least, Newcastle United managed to overcome Huddersfield Town. Goals from Shola Ameobi, Danny Guthrie, Geremi (I know ðŸ˜® ) and Kevin Nolan sealed a great comeback for the hard-working lads. Indeed that&amp;rsquo;sÂ what they did, they worked. Although we had to introduce our first teamers, it was quiet a good performance all round by the little Newcastle squad. The much talked about, Nile Ranger played the game and did quiet well in what seemed to be a 4-5-1 formation from stand in boss, Chris Hughton.</description>
