      <description>Well it does feel good to stay top of the table and even better to score four goals against a pretty decent Coventry City team. In what was a must-win game ( which ones aren&amp;rsquo;t? ) the lads truly delivered. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t start the best, and it took us a little while to get into the game, we eventually got a grasp on the game and didn&amp;rsquo;t loosen our grip on it once we scored.</description>

      <description>Ranger - Netted again tonight as we saw Routledge &amp;amp; Williamson in action Tonights affair was a game we needed all three points from and the lads duly delivered the goods. In what was a Crystal Palace team without one of their main men in Victor Moses saw them concede within twenty minutes, a Shaun Derry O.G. In fairness, it seems as if Palace gave it a real go and could well have got something out of the game on another day.</description>

      <description>Routledge - a Very good signing for the Toon Army is you ask me It&amp;rsquo;s surprise news to say the least to hear that Newcastle have signed Wayne Routledge from QPR today and very good news if you ask me. The winger has signed a reported 3 and a half deal on Tyneside and for a fee of Â£1m, which if true, is very good value. Routledge as you might remember was a Tottenham and Villa former and an exciting winger.</description>
