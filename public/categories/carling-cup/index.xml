      <description>###Â Enrique - Being realistic about cup chances
Jose Enrique, speaking today has rubbished Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning the Carling Cup this year, saying we simply &amp;lsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t have the legs for it&amp;rsquo;. He may well be right too you know, and is being realistic. Not many Toon fans are ever too confident when it comes to cups with Newcastle and the likelihood is, we&amp;rsquo;ll be nowhere near the major stages of this competition when it comes into it&amp;rsquo;s prime.</description>

      <description>Well in what was quiet an exciting game to say the least, Newcastle United managed to overcome Huddersfield Town. Goals from Shola Ameobi, Danny Guthrie, Geremi (I know ðŸ˜® ) and Kevin Nolan sealed a great comeback for the hard-working lads. Indeed that&amp;rsquo;sÂ what they did, they worked. Although we had to introduce our first teamers, it was quiet a good performance all round by the little Newcastle squad. The much talked about, Nile Ranger played the game and did quiet well in what seemed to be a 4-5-1 formation from stand in boss, Chris Hughton.</description>
