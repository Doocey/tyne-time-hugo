      <description>Fans - Tired of Ashley and his ownership After an embarrassing defeat to Leyton Orient yesterday it really put a cap on Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s tenure. Probably the biggest friendly loss in a long time, the Newcastle players didn&amp;rsquo;t seem bothered, besides the odd exception. It can&amp;rsquo;t be called anything short of a disgrace and Leyton players were magnificent to say the least. Mind you, Orient are a League 1 side and we have to play many a Championship game this year, who inevitably will be better than Leyton.</description>
