      <description>Vuckic - Delighted after scoring his first goal for Newcastle United Newcastle kicked off their first preparation for the upcoming Premier League campaign by defeating Carlisle by three goals, with Leon Best, Haris Vuckic and Nile Ranger all hitting the back of the net. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see the goals but they were meant to be nice finishes from all three. Whilst seeing off The Cumbrians, the Toon lads sported the new Newcastle United away strip, and it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice jersey to say the least.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times before, and it&amp;rsquo;s been emphasised quite a lot elsewhere is the youth setup Newcastle United have at the minute and indeed the fruit we are bearing from it. It&amp;rsquo;s without a doubt the best thing Mike Ashley implemented on Tyneside during his torrid tenure but I&amp;rsquo;m speaking as if he&amp;rsquo;s gone, unfortunately he&amp;rsquo;s not, just yet. A man who is attracting a lot of interest at just 17 is Haris Vu?</description>
