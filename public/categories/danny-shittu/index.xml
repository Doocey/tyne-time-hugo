      <description>Sky Sports are reporting that Bolton&amp;rsquo;s Danny Shittu could well arrive on Tyneside on a loan deal until the end of the season. The Nigerian hasn&amp;rsquo;t really had much of a look in at the Reebok and with the arrival of Owen Coyle, Newcastle are hopeful they can borrow the 6&amp;rsquo;2 centre half. Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know too much about him, he&amp;rsquo;s 29 years of age, a Nigerian international and has played for a fair few clubs in his time.</description>
