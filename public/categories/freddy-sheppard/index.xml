      <description>### Shepherd - Front runner for Newcastle takeover? - hopefully not
Surprisingly , the BBC have taken a time out from Wimbledon and have broken a story that I will lead to many. Apparently if all goes well, Newcastle will be sold by then end of the month, but we&amp;rsquo;re nearly there and there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any signs of a takeover happening. However now, as we already know Shepherd is interested and is as reported leading the race with a £60m bid, which is expected to be accepted by Mike Ashley.</description>
