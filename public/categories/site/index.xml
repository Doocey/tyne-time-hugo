      <description>Christmas - Enjoy what&amp;rsquo;s been a good year for Alan Pardew and Newcastle Utd The season so far has been quite aÂ surprisinglyÂ successful one. Newcastle United lay comfortably in the top half of the Premier League and on course for this campaigns expectations. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some memorable results including the win away at Sunderland, our thrashing of Stoke City away from home, and indeed we even went unbeaten in the Premier League for a record amount of games.</description>

      <description>####Â Carroll - Misses out on the Portuguese encounter tomorrow due to injury
We&amp;rsquo;re all feeling the pinch - I know it myself. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a proven study that a lot of people are indeed adding Gambling to their list of growing hobbies and it is often providing some much needed extra cash. The stereotypical view of a bookmaker is someone who takes all your money and can be arrogant in the process.</description>

      <description>As Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s exciting season continues on the field, Tyne Time have teamed up with Dean &amp;lsquo;Midas&amp;rsquo; Maynard, one the worlds most renowned psychics who has many successes to date. Dean and myself have agreed to have a little challenge to see who&amp;rsquo;s predictions are most accurate for the remaining 13 Coca Cola Championship games. Obviously a lot of people will be skeptic of Dean&amp;rsquo;s abilities and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m not really a man into this kind of stuff but nevertheless, it interests me.</description>

      <description>###Â Team - Top the league and a nice way to end the year
As Christmas is over and we enter a new year, it again brings back the memories of 2009 and all those incidents. Sportingwise, I cannot forget Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s relegation from the Premier League or indeed the way in Ireland missed out on a World Cup place yet again. However, in a few hours we will have entered a new era, 2010.</description>

      <description>###Â Seasons Greetings to all you readers
As you know it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Eve and tomorrow is Christmas day. Tyne Time would like to wish all it&amp;rsquo;s readers and every Geordie in the world, from Brazil to Australia, a very very Happy Christmas. I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of things have happened since the last time Christmas was celebrated, some good, some bad. However, for Newcastle United, things have marginally picked up. 10 points clear at the top of the Coca Cola Championship and stability at once is seems.</description>

      <title>Is it really fair for Shola to make World Cup and Shay to stay at home?</title>

      <description>To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not in the best of moods today, mainly because France have cheated their way to the World Cup Finals in in South Africa at the expense of my nation, Ireland. Thierry Henry above all people blatantly handled the ball, not once but twice before laying it on William Gallas&amp;rsquo; head to head home an undeserved winner. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound biased but obviously I will as it&amp;rsquo;s my country who have been denied a spot in South Africa.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the week again when Tyne Time gathers all it&amp;rsquo;s prestige and invaluable information to form a bet which will see a charity of it&amp;rsquo;s choice, hopefully, be in luck and win 50% of the bet winnings. Last Saturday didn&amp;rsquo;t go too well but this week we here Tyne Time feel that this weeks one might stand more of a chance. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you might have saw the article a little further down the page about donating to keep this weekly bet going, and I must say that hopefully if any donations do come through we can keep this feature going for weeks to come.</description>

      <description>Before I start, I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for donations of 20,000 so I can put a pot together to stage a takeover of Newcastle United or become a leading member of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust. Far from it, although if you feel like donating twenty thousand fee free to do so ðŸ˜€ Anyway, what I am writing this article about, is the matter of &amp;lsquo;Tyne Time&amp;rsquo;s Weekend Charity Bet&amp;rsquo; which will tomorrow commence for it&amp;rsquo;s second week running.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to dedicate this article to someone I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of people will know, especially Newcastle United fans. Today Ed Harrison from NUFCBLOG has announced that he closing the site after 2 years of constant writing. Ed never failed to produce articles on any given day and considering he indeed lives in a different time zone in America, it&amp;rsquo;s a credit to him, what he hasÂ achieved. His article archives are full to the brim and he has written in the region ofÂ 7,858 articles, a staggering amount for one man.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do something different for these exciting weekends of football and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided on a Charity Weekend Bet. This weekend brings a huge amount of games happening in the UK, ranging from Premier League, Championship, League 1, League 2, Scottish Premier Division and FA Cup. Every once in a while, Tyne Time will place Â£1 on a number of fixtures that should they come through, will pay out handsome dividends.</description>
