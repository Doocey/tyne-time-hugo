      <description>The dislike of Dennis Wise for many Newcastle United fans stems from Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s departure, James Milner&amp;rsquo;s move to Aston Villa, the signing of the Uruguayan Gonzalez, Xisco&amp;rsquo;s arrival on Tyneside and many other incidents at the club. He did spot Bassong and a few other promising young players but will never be warmly welcomed back to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park if he arrives some time in the future. we passed down the chance to sign Bastian Schweinsteiger who reportedly was keen for a switch to Newcastle United, Wise again having something to do with this.</description>
