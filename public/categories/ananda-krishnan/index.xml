      <description>Krishnan - Why only deny interest now? Oh lordy, the nonsense continues . One minute Ananda Krishnan is all set to takeover and now he&amp;rsquo;s confirmed he&amp;rsquo;s not interested in buying the club at all. This leaves us questioning everything. Perhaps there is another Malaysian in there? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s an Asian buyer or maybe , just maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that Singaporean group that said they were interested in buying last month.</description>

      <description>The debacle seems to continue on for ever but Mike Ashley is leaving, it&amp;rsquo;s official, although we already knew that, it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in the next couple of days with Ananda Krishnan completing the buyout. indeed Â£100m isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to the billionaire that is worth just under $8bn and I&amp;rsquo;m sure a Â£20m transfer budget wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be stretching the bank either ðŸ˜€ We&amp;rsquo;re expecting a press conference soon about the announcement as the Malaysians are putting the finishing touches to the deal.</description>

      <description>There is more news about the mystery Malaysian bidder today, and his name is believed to beÂ Ananda Krishnan a rich foreigner that is worth $7.5bn, a little less than Robert Kuok but certainly a very wealthy man. Reports are surfacing, especially in
The Chronicle that an Â£80m bid has been submitted and that Seymour Pierce has recommended a buyer to to Mike Ashley already, indeed it&amp;rsquo;s believed to be this man.</description>

      <title>Malaysians supposedly interested in purchasing Newcastle United</title>

      <description>According to BBC Radio, Derek Llambias was showing a Malaysian bidder around St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. This news has only broken so it&amp;rsquo;s in, its infancy details-wise. Apparently the bidder could be a representative of Robert Kuok, who is worth $10bn as of last year. That is some fortune to have, indeed his nickname is &amp;lsquo;Sugar King of Asia&amp;rsquo; because he is responsible for about 10% of the worlds sugar! To make it even better , he&amp;rsquo;s a modest and quiet man that keeps to himself, perfect for Newcastle United if you ask me.</description>
