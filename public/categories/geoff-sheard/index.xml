      <description>Sitting here in an internet cafe in the Algarve, the weather is almost too hot for comfort, so, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to muster up an article or two. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been away it seems there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk and not much action per usual, but the good news that greeted me today, was reports that the firesale had ended at Newcastle United, and that&amp;rsquo;s very good news, to say the least.</description>

      <description>### Sheard - Supposedly watched the Palace game
Things are never dull at Newcastle, not for one minute. All of a sudden we&amp;rsquo;re being taken over, then we have a deadline set, and then the deadline delayed. The latest gust of news/rumours/(made up nonsense), is that Newcastle United have a new bidder. In the Chronicle in the last few minutes, Lee Ryder has posted up a ground breaking (well not really) story, that Geoff Sheard is making a bid for the Magpies.</description>
