      <description>#### Duo - Chance for Perch and Kádár to stake their claims in the NUFC first team
Fourteen games into the Premier League campaign and we&amp;rsquo;ve managed the same back five for all of it. A proud achievement.

James Perch, Dan Gosling, Sol Campbell, Cheick Tioté &amp;amp; Hatem Ben Arfa all signed for Newcastle United,a nd four of those on a permanent basis. The pick of the bunch really is a coin toss between Dan Gosling and Hatem Ben Arfa, but the fact Ben Arfa is fit and ready to go unlike his counterpart, perhaps shades it for the Frenchman.</description>
