      <description>### Kevin - Insistent on suing Mike Ashley
It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day to see a former Newcastle footballer and manager, win a court case against his &amp;lsquo;beloved&amp;rsquo; club. However, you have to look at Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s side of the story. Perhaps he deserved it, maybe there&amp;rsquo;s no question about it, but surely you think that Keegan wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to such lengths just to be able to say he was right. Today Mike Ashley was ordered to pay £2m in compensation to Kevin and perhaps even more, dependent on future developments.</description>

      <description>### Harewood - Enjoying his first training session
It could only happen at Newcastle, where their local cult hero, leaves the club, not for the first time, and then, turn around and tries to sue the clubs owner. As yo probably guessed it&amp;rsquo;s Kevin Keegan I&amp;rsquo;m talking about and his little affair with Mike Ashley. Today, the case closed are the tribunal resigned in order to make their decision. Whether Keegan will win his case is still unknown but he must be pretty confident when he&amp;rsquo;s brought the millionaire to the courts over &amp;lsquo;an unfair dismissal&amp;rsquo;.</description>
