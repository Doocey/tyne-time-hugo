      <description>Harper - Being looked at by Fabio Capello? There&amp;rsquo;s reports that Steve Harper could well be line for a call up by England manager, Fabio Capello. Of coruse Harper has been doing well and very well at that, it would be great to see the man represent Newcastle in the World Cup in South Africa. Whether this story is made up or not I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure but I could honestly see Harper between the sticks for England, and perhaps a long time coming.</description>
