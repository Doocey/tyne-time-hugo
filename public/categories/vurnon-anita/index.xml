      <description>While in my usual routine of browsing Twitter (@KevinDoocey if you&amp;rsquo;re not following!) I noticed a large number of Newcastle United fans detailing out their preferred starting eleven ahead of the upcoming Premier League season. Most people had a similar forward featuring the likes of Rémy Cabella, Siem de Jong and indeed Emmanuel Rivière. However, when it came to our midfield line-up, there were a few differences. What caught my eye was the quantity of people who had Jack Colback starting ahead of Vurnon Anita in a holding position.</description>

      <description>As many of you will know and are probably tired of me pointing out (!) I am a big fan of &amp;lt;Vurnon Anita and his style of play. Many Newcastle fans were quick to play down his potential when he arrived from Ajax in 2012 for £7m, but from the few performances he put in it was clear - to me at least - that this guy is a technically astute player.</description>
