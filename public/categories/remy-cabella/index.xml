      <description>Finally, after several bouts of negotiation, it appears that Newcastle United have at last, agreed a deal for Montpellier&amp;rsquo;s Rémy Cabella. The Frenchman has been linked with a move to St. James&amp;rsquo; Park since last year, and this is not the first time that NUFC fans have been assured of a move, however, the difference this time, is that there are a number of reputable French sources claiming that the son of Montpellier owner Louis Nicollin, Laurent, has confirmed that the two sides have reached an agreement over the transfer of their key player.</description>
