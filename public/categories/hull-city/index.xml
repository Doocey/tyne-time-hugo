      <description>Phil Brown is now playing hardball as want away Habib Beye is subject of transfer bids. If you told Newcastle fan this time last year that Habib Beye would be going to Hull and Newcastle would be in the Championship they&amp;rsquo;d either laugh it off or go into serious depression, somehow I&amp;rsquo;d say the first option would be a popular one. Anyway, Hull are interested in Habib Beye and Newcastle are prepared to sell.</description>
