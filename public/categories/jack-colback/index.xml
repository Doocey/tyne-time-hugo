      <description>When Jack Colback completed a free transfer to Newcastle United from bitter rivals Sunderland, few would have imagined that the 24 year-old would become the first name on the teamsheet at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. As many of you will know from reading my articles, Jack Colback is someone I always rated, particularly during his time at Sunderland, in other words, I did fancy him to evolve into a very good midfielder on Tyneside, but perhaps not so soon.</description>

      <description>There are many supporters on both sides of the deal questioning why exactly Newcastle United have agreed to sign midfielder Jack Colback. A Sunderland academy graduate, Colback has reportedly signed a lengthy deal with bitter rivals Newcastle, rebuffing Sunderland&amp;rsquo;s offer of a new and improved contract. Not only that, but the 24 year-old also turned down a staggering £50k a week to join West Ham, according to reputable sources in London.</description>
