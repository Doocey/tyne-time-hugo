      <description>Although we know that there probably won&amp;rsquo;t be any new faces arriving this summer to Newcastle United it&amp;rsquo;s irritating to see where the players, that could be Newcastle players, go to different clubs. For example , Kyle Naughton went to Spurs, fair enough, we mighn&amp;rsquo;t have stood much of a chance there, but Daniel Fox went to Celtic, I think we could&amp;rsquo;ve snapped him. Jermaine Beckford has been taken off the transfer list although his agent stated he wanted to join Newcastle pretty much and Simon Cox going to Brom, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure he&amp;rsquo;d be tempted to join Newcastle if he was given the chance.</description>
