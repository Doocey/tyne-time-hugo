      <description>St.James&amp;rsquo; - Will be graced by Hatem Ben Arfa &amp;amp; Cheick Tioté against Blackpool Five players signed, and a job well done by Chris Hughton and co. James Perch, Dan Gosling, Sol Campbell, Cheick Tioté &amp;amp; Hatem Ben Arfa all signed for Newcastle United,a nd four of those on a permanent basis. The pick of the bunch really is a coin toss between Dan Gosling and Hatem Ben Arfa, but the fact Ben Arfa is fit and ready to go unlike his counterpart, perhaps shades it for the Frenchman.</description>
