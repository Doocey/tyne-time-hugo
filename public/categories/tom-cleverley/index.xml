      <description>Reports today claim that Chris Hughton is looking at Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s Tom Cleverley. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the tabloids combined have managed nearly five articles on Newcastle alone but if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind if this rumour is true. Cleverly who is on loan with Watford has showed glimpses of why he is indeed with Manchester United. So far, he&amp;rsquo;s played 14 games, scored 5 goals and had 4 assists.</description>
