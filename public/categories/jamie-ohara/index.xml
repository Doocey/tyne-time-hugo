      <description>The vibes coming from the hierarchy of Newcastle United are very encouraging ones indeed of late, and Mike Ashley is seemingly doing the impossible, in becoming a slightly better owner. For now anyway. A season in the Coca Cola Championship has given us time to think about things on Tyneside and the goings on at the club while at the same time, perched on top of the table, ready for regaining our Premier League status.</description>

      <description>There are reports emerging that Chris Hughton was in Scotland yesterday to watch John Ruddy play and keep tabs on the youngsters progress. The 23 year-old which is quite young for a keeper is on loan at Motherwell from Everton, with the hope he can finally over-take Time Howard between the sticks. If that&amp;rsquo;s hard enough, it&amp;rsquo;s a very long shot that he&amp;rsquo;ll outdo either the long-serving Steve Harper or indeed Time Krul and that&amp;rsquo;s before I even mention Fraser Forster.</description>
