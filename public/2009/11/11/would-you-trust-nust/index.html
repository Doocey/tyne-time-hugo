				<!-- Article Start -->
				<p>You have to credit them really for pursuing their ambitions in owning their local football club Newcastle United. However, it&rsquo;s still questionable whether NUST or Newcastle United Supporters Trust have what it takes to run a football club which is mainly, money. The &lsquo;Yes We Can&rsquo; campaign has been launched and their members are really serious about taking the club off Mike  Ashley&rsquo;s hands and allowing the fans to have a real say in affairs at Newcastle United. Communism keeps springing to mind when I hear it, sounds good in theory but whether this will please all sides or indeed work at all, is a big big question.</p>

<p>Saying that, I think it&rsquo;s a great idea and if they managed to get some serious financial backing behind them either from abroad or at home then we could make a right go at managing a football club from the roots to the tips.</p>

<p>Speaking today the statement read :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&lsquo;There are a range of ways to invest but fans can be sure that it will be on a &lsquo;one investor, one vote&rsquo; basis with fans electing six fans representatives through the trust and a president who will bring in a professional team accountable to the fans ultimately.&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that&rsquo;s it back by mainly Geordies is a good thing but you can&rsquo;t help but question if it will ever happen, or if it will work out. As well as this, I can&rsquo;t see Mike Ashley changing his mind after taking the club off the market and &lsquo;laying down&rsquo; new plans for the club.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Mike Ashley is a man we all want gone from the club but do you think Newcastle United Supporter&rsquo;s Trust are ready for a mammoth task of running a football club?</p>

I agree the owner needs to go but if the local business peeps want the fans to back the idea first and the fans want some celebrity or business people to show their support we&#39;re then stuck in the classic catch 22.</p>

As far as having the cash is concerned and potentially having to run the club at a loss.  No one here actually know the true state of the clubs finances, with the exception of those that have done due diligence, I apologise but I refuse to believe another word that comes out of the Ashley camp, due to him having ripped any bond of trust between me as a supporter and himself in to tiny pieces over the course of the last few years.

So what do we do about it.  Way I see it we have three options.

1. Sit around hoping some foreign money man comes in, and risk that they might be just as inept as the current lot or as dishonest as the lot before.
2. Stick with Ashley&#39;s ridiculous, business ethos of &#39;stack em high and sell em cheap&#39;, and at potentially end up supporting a team renamed &#39;Fat Mike&#39;s All Stars&#39; if he thinks it&#39;ll make him a couple of quid here and there.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">If NUST did buy the club at 2000 squiddlies a person , how do they then start paying the players wages ? The crowd returns once a fortnight , may not in themselves be sufficient , and financial backers such as adidas may have a touch of the seconds if they don&#39;t believe their sponsorship is financially secure ....</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I would love it to work and would support it if i could, but seeing as im a studnet who lives off beans on toast 1500 is a step to far :P. I just cant see the finances to support the day to day running of the club coming in even if they do get 100 million (the price would go to 100million, not 80million as Ashley recently pumped 20million into the club) or the bank for example providing an overdraft or loan to the club. Large investment companies, Newcastles elite businessman and Fat Freddy couldnt afford the asking price after viewing the clubs books, i dont wont to be negative or anything but its a very long shot. 

Also who are the NUST? Who actually is in charge? Yes granted its a fan but i im sure Gordon Brown is a fan of Britain and he cocked that up. Last time i thought of the trust, they were protesting at the most inappropriate times (ie right before  crucial relegation games), putting out statements, speaking on the radio and trying to arrnage meetings with the clubs owners like they are the representitives of all of the clubs supporters and that was not the case.</p>

Whilst I would not say I am a fan of Fat Mike or the idiots before, but this is a non starter, at least Ashley will not let us go bust, he is only hanging on to get some cash back, when we get in the prem he will sell and we will have a new man in charge that we can all moan about!!!! I suppose that NUST want shearer in charge as well. Now he is worth a few bob, haven&#39;t seen him punting his cash into it!!!!</p>
