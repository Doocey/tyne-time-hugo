				<p>###¬†Beckford - Is he really worth the hassle of luring to Toon?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no lie to say that Jermaine Beckford is probably the best striker in League 1 albeit closely followed by Grant Holt of Norwich City. Racking up 16 goals to date, Beckford of course is attracting interest from beyond League 1 and our very own Newcastle United have been linked many a time with the 6&rsquo;2 London born striker. It&rsquo;s believed that Beckford was being scouted and chased  by the Toon Army when Dennis Wise was somehow in charge or sourcing new players for what was then, Kevin Keegan&rsquo;s Newcastle United.</p>

<p>Hughton said today :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúJermaine Beckford is one of a few players that will, of course, be of interest to us.‚ÄúIn the work that we‚Äôve done over the last few weeks and months, there have been numerous names that have been thrown at us.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWe have to look at all the options we have, but, certainly, Jermaine‚Äôs a player that will come into those options.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>He can&rsquo;t say it much clearer. Hughton would like Jermaine Beckford playing in a Black and White jersey, and sooner rather than later. My question is however, is Beckford good enough for Newcastle?</em></p>

<p><em>As we lay top of the table, a few points ahead of West Brom, it does look like an immediate return for us Magpies to the Premier League. However, it&rsquo;s far from certain yet. My question to you, is signing a League 1 striker, 26 years of age a good direction to be taking when it looks as if Premier League football beckons in 6 months time?</em></p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think it is. Fair enough Beckford could be a very neat striker and I have saw signs in his play to suggest he can move up a level or two. However, he&rsquo;s quite a controversial character too and has had his fair share of problems at his respective clubs.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong, maybe this guy could set the Coca Cola Championship alight and distance Newcastle United from West Brom and our promotion rivals. Maybe he&rsquo;s just reaching his potential as we speak. Either way, it seems as Chris Hughton wants him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not only Chris who is said to want him though, reports are that Hull City &amp; maybe even Blackburn Rovers could make a move for the hitman. As January approaches, it seems as if Chris is preparing a list of targets and realistic ones too.</p>

<p>If we Beckford is on it, and we do sign the lad, what next?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">It seems to me that Beckford is a natural goalscorer and these guys will score at any standard, given the right support. Look at Andy Cole - we signed him from a club who, albeit in the same division as us, were not the same standard. With our brand of attacking football, Cole quickly settled and as we progressed so did he. So I would say it&#39;s all well and good signing Beckford but maybe we need to find another Peter Beardsley as well. Easy said than done???</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Jermain Beckford has shown he is far too good for League One. Far too good. The guy scores for fun.

He has pace and guile, an eye for goal, and is full of confidence, so why not get him in? It will be a step up for the lad, but so to will be the players around him. We are a step or two above Leeds and Jermain should prosper with the likes of Gutierezz, Carroll, Ameobi, Nolan, Smith, Guthrie, Barton etc all around him. These guys are international quality players (maybe with the exception of Guthrie and too soon for Carroll). If we get him in positions to score, I am confident he will score. We need his type.

Dan Egan says we need to find another Peter Beardsley? Well he may not be in the same class as him yet but Tom Cleverley from Watford via Man United is the guy I want desperately. He is a playmaker, wonderful talent and would help our midfield creativity heaps.

I think we will get Matt Kilgallon and Jermain Beckford this transfer window and hopefully sign Danny Simpson permanently. Good business that will hopefully carry us back to where we belong, The Premier League.</p>

He has pace and guile, an eye for goal, and is full of confidence, so why not get him in? It will be a step up for the lad, but so to will be the players around him. We are a step or two above Leeds and Jermain should prosper with the likes of Gutierezz, Carroll, Ameobi, Nolan, Smith, Guthrie, Barton etc all around him. These guys are international quality players (maybe with the exception of Guthrie and too soon for Carroll). If we get him in positions to score, I am confident he will score. We need his type.

Dan Egan says we need to find another Peter Beardsley? Well he may not be in the same class as him yet but Tom Cleverley from Watford via Man United is the guy I want desperately. He is a playmaker, wonderful talent and would help our midfield creativity heaps.

I think we will get Matt Kilgallon and Jermain Beckford this transfer window and hopefully sign Danny Simpson permanently. Good business that will hopefully carry us back to where we belong, The Premier League.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Beckford Eh?
Taking a risk but for 1.5 mill.why not could turn out to be another Andy Cole.
What appear to be the alternatives are a rumored Boyd from Rangers, a proven goalscorer, but would cost a lot more, plus unproven in what might be a step up, the PL.
Then there`s Harewood who has gradually improved and has five goals, problem is he has never been a great scorer and is around thirty , as apposed to the other two in their mid twenties.
Looking at a possible deal for Beckford @1.5m. plus 2m. for killgallon, strengthening both CD and CF, sounds like good business.</p>
