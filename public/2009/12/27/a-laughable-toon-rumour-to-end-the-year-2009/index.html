<p>The Sunday Sun are reporting that Real Madrid could well be lining up a move for Newcastle&rsquo;s Fabricio Coloccini after Pepe&rsquo;s injury has proven to be a serious one, and will keep the Portuguese international out of action for months to come. In fairness to Coloccini, he&rsquo;s being doing well this season as you&rsquo;d expect, especially from a ¬£10.3m signing who played in the Champions  League only a few years back. However, yesterday we saw glimpses of uncertainty in the Argentine&rsquo;s play but nothing too serious, as he wasn&rsquo;t at fault for anything major.</p>

<p>The news that Real Madrid who it&rsquo;s fair to say, aren&rsquo;t in the best of form this season in general, are after Coloccini is a true laughable rumour. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it could well be true, but come on , do you honestly think they&rsquo;d be looking to the Coca Cola Championship for a new CB or indeed Newcastle?</p>

<p>The team is full of superstars, the likes of ¬£80m Ronaldo, Kak√°, Higuain, Van der Vaart, Ramos and so on and so forth. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be looking to add Fabricio Coloccini to their ranks, especially after his performances last season.</p>

<p>Saying that, his form at Deportivo obviously hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten and the former AC Milan man has potential. An Argentine international and when at Deportivo, one of their most reliable defenders in the last decade. So that brings us to the question, are Real Madrid really after Coloccini?</p>

<p>You tell me.</p>

He is a class defender top class.

6 bad games out of 36 last season, his FIRST season in English football in the the fast paced premier league does not make him a bad player and a flop.

He is a top class player. If he goes WE WILL MISS HIM!

There is definitely some truth to this rumour. So you had better hope we keep a hold of him. He has been INTEGRAL to our solid defence this season. And he WILL play in the world cup this coming summer.</p>

I just dont get it, most fans support their clubs and players, NUFC fans are the most critical and hard to please fans I have ever come across.
Whether it`s Players (And i have heard everyone at some time panned)owner, manager , scouts , trainers, etc.
They all come in for some kinda negitive shit !
What are you all depressed and cant enjoy the relative success we are having, with perhaps new players coming in and on our way to promotion etc.
Perhaps it would be better if we were half way down the table like the Smoggies and you could really vent.
Tell me what is it, been so long since things were good you forgot how to react in the positive ?</p>

The fact is Colo likes to play football, he is the sort of ball playing defender teams dream of having. Unfortunately this isnt used in our pump it up field to the big man tactic. I would like to see him in a few games in the middle of the park.

I have thought he is a very good player for years, but i dont think the EPL is right for him. If we get 10 million offer from spain it would be best for both toon and colo for it to go through as he would be better in the spainish league and we could get a few solid players for that cash.</p>

it will only be good for him , this time in a  lower league,,

on a second point, last year,, you can blame the defence all you like .,  but i look at our midfield,, total sh*t, no suport to the forwards, or the deffence, 

to be honest im not sure how we are top of the league, as i dont think we have played well at all, i would like to give some of the young players more time on the pitch, dont have to start with them,, not a fan of hairwood or lovenkrands,,
