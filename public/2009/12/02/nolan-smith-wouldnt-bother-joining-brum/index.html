				<p>###¬†Smith - Neither of the lads would leave Tyneside this January</p>

<p>Although the headline might sound a little disrespectful to Birmingham, I don&rsquo;t mean it that way. However, both of the lads have said that they don&rsquo;t want a move away from Newcastle and for me, that&rsquo;s that. Smith and Nolan both joined for decent fees and haven&rsquo;t lived up to their price tag. Even though Nolan &amp; Smith have looked pretty comfortable this season so far, you&rsquo;d  expect that as they&rsquo;re playing a division below their usual standard.</p>

<p>Birmingham¬† may be a Premier League team and fair play to them, but not for long I don&rsquo;t think. They&rsquo;ve been in very good form of late and are securing important wins like at Wolves, Sunderland and so on. Saying that, I think it&rsquo;ll be quite tight in May and¬† Brum may well be shoved into the bottom three.</p>

<p>So would Smith &amp; Nolan join a team in January that have a serious chance of being relegated? I don&rsquo;t think they would. I mean, no offence to Birmingham but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be able to handle their wages and talent demands.</p>

<p>Besides that their new foreign owner has reportedly issued ¬£40m for Alex McLeish for the transfer window. Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t for me to say but certainly they&rsquo;d be able to offer a substantial fee for Nolan/Smith.</p>

<p>Mike Ashley would probably accept the bid, but it Chris didn&rsquo;t want to sell him then you&rsquo;d expect Hughton to have the final say, or so he said he will. Now is not the time to losing players and I wouldn&rsquo;t like to see one player leave the club this Christmas. If we want to try get promoted we need new players, not departures.</p>

No offence to Newcastle but you are no longer in the same league as Birmingham.

Given the way Bowyer is flourishing, I&#39;d expect Nolan to be a useful addition to the squad - but Alan Smith - no thanks !

If you think Brum will be in the bottom 3 in May you are way off beam - we are way away of the relegation fodder which is still way away of the top of the Championship !</p>

I think not. Nolan is a great midfielder and would fit very nicely into the new look Birmingham midfield that actually pass the ball forward. Good old mike will probably accept a cheeky 5mil no matter what chris h wants. Since when has Ashley given a monkeys about doing what is best for your club? 
Anyway you of coursenwill be back up next season but don&#39;t think for a second that your players really care about the club. They really don&#39;t.... And you can keep smith....

It&#39;s been nice having you lot in the chumpionship this year. I have been so happy that ssn have not gone to st james park for breaking news that 100,000 unemployed jordies have gathered outside the stadium be as someone said alan shearer had driven past or keegan had farted or whatever it is that gets you lot going... Nice to see shearer crawled back to the BBC at the end of last season though hey!!

He&#39;ll have noticed how Birmingham have helped Lee Bowyer and Stephen Carr rebuild their careers, which were both in ruins after they joined the footballers&#39; graveyard that is Newcastle United.  If they can do it for Bowyer and Carr, they can do it for Nolan.

As for Smith?  He was rubbish even before he joined Newcastle, so I can&#39;t see there&#39;s any career there left to rebuild.</p>

Birmingham City are a well run club, can the same be said of Newcastle?
Eck is building a team for the future in the premiership.
We don&#39;t want Nolan or Smith, give me Fergie/Bowyer anyday over that pair.
I think you&#39;ll find there are at least 5/6 teams worse than us in the prem - next time do your homework before you &#39;write&#39; an article!</p>

It would appear our Geordie relations still have ideas that they are a big club. Wake up lads - you are in the Fizzy Pop league at the moment or had you forgotton ? As for Nolan and Smith - no thanks. We are looking to push on not go backwards.

So you really think a club sitting mid-table at the beginning of december, with the 3rd best defence in the Prem and money to spend in January are a sure bet for relegation ? Have you not seen Wolves/Bolton/West Ham/portsmouth  play ? oh no, sorry I forgot, you&#39;re in a different division aren&#39;t you ! Silly me.</p>

that was coz of the owner  yes we did struggle to attract managers but that is coz of ashley and who would want to work for him that doesnt make us a small club but what makes us a big club is the fact that our lowest attendance this season (36,000)is about 7,ooo higher than your highest despite us being a league below we have the 3rd biggest stadium in the country excluding wembley of course</p>

No way blues will be relegated, you defence might be holding its own in fizzy pop land but they aren&#39;t up to the job in superior league. 

You can keep both your players ... im trying to recall what they did last year ... ahhhh - nothing!

Bowyer and carr just needed a little quality around them, they now have that at blues. No disrespect like but it was hardly you getting rid of bowyer - all ur decent players wanted to go ... Bowyer, Dyer, Solano, Given, Jenas, Milner .... thats without thinking too hard.

Are you guys thick or something?
The clue is in the title... tynetime!
Bugger off to your own fansites where you&#39;ll probably post with just as much bias and propoganda drivel for your club.

To be honest though, you can&#39;t not say we&#39;re a big club when we do attract the 2nd or 3rd highest gates in the country on a weekend.

The definition of big is the size of something; not how successful it is at any given time. 
Therefore Newcastle are a big club, whether you like it or not!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">This argument is utterly ridiculous... an argument is never going to be won and lost between 2 sets of football fans as they believe so strongly in their own cause...
The truth is, Newcastle are a poorly run club, and are currently relying on their own history to convince themselves that they are better, the truth is, we are in the championship for a reason, and the sooner we appreciate that this is a rebuilding process, the better. 
As for Birmingham, it is awesome to see a club come into the premiership and do so well. I hate league when 3 teams come up and go straight back down again, it is not interesting.
Nolan does not need to revive his career, regardless of the league he is playing in he is is flourishing at the moment, and he is a joy to watch. If some of the Birmingham fans had watched him this season, they would see that he is not a has been like Bowyer and Carr both were, but he is an excellent player currently on top of his game. A move to Birmingham for him, however, would be senseless, if Newcastle carry on the way they are in the championship, they will back in the prem next year and whether either sets of fans like it, they will be in a similar position. 
Good luck Birmingham, i genuinely hope you stay up and consolidate.</p>

Ever heard of paragraphs mate?
Also its you&#39;re not your in that context.
Maybe if you were actually educated well, you would have seen sense and supported the only decent team in your city, Aston Villa.

Plus what do you base your accusations of shit fans on?
We have a reputation for being the most loyal, friendly you can meet, ever been to St. James?
In fact ever even been to St Andrews?
I bet you&#39;re just another armchair support having never owned a season ticket in your nothing of a life.

You honestly believe all the media drivel that is thrown at you by the London papers?
We don&#39;t ask for the coverage, in fact we all would prefer to rarely get a look in for news, except locally, a lot like yourselves do at the minute.

Again apart from a few rogue fans, who unfortunately get the exposure, we all admit we&#39;re an average club in terms of success, results don&#39;t lie and we&#39;re in the Championship at the moment on the back of this, but in terms of size you can&#39;t deny we are a big sized club, our attendances say it all.

Since you don&#39;t have the capability to read through my previous post, here you go for a dictionary definition of big:

big

  ‚Ä¢ adjective (bigger, biggest) 1 of considerable size, physical power, or extent. 

I&#39;d say a club with a 52,000 stadium with an average attendance of 40,801 in the second tier is considered to be of considerable size, do you not think?
Especially considering it is a lot higher than your average attendance of 23,190 in the Premier League.
I mean when was the last time Birmingham had an away crowd above 3000, never mind 5700 away to Barnsley of all teams?</p>

I&#39;d guess out of 60&#43; replies that there&#39;s probably 5 different people posting. :)

Birmingham are doing well this season and I think you have a good manager, good luck.

Unbelievably after two of our worst seasons for years and relegation we still have attendances of over 40K. 

After years of having over paid underachievers @ SJP we have now lowered the wage bill quite conciderably and will do so again this summer with one or two more (thinking of Geremi for e.g.). We also have a sole owner who admittedly has loaned the club money but he cannot get it back until we are succesful again, it&#39;s not like he can realistically put us into receivership!

Newcastle United have a huge fanbase (amazingly) still and for the first time in a few seasons we are able to enjoy winning games and yes we had to drop into the CCC league to do it, I do fear for next season if we are promoted as I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll have a good enough team to stay up and not convinced the owner will donate enough money to buy the players needed for us to stay up.


So Brummies, nice to see some comments here but tbh us GEORDIES are not all the same.

Good luck guys.</p>

I&#39;ll lay my cards on the table, I&#39;m a Birmingham supporter. Not a Brummie but in fact a Silhillian. I think that both Nolan and Smith are credible players and I would certainly take both of them if we were shipping out Damian Johnson &amp;amp;/or Lee Carsley otherwise the point of buying two players with medium sized wage packets would seemingly make little sense. Nolan would be an asset but then I hardly think he would have the wow factor that our new ownership would want, and I also think that Bowyer would take someone a lot better to replace him as on current form Lee is looking like a world beater. I appreciate that he didn&#39;t have such a good time in the north east but then I guess that happens to us all at some point. I&#39;m glad that he now feels comfortable in Birmingham and playing alongside another surprisingly good player this season in Barry Ferguson.

The my club bigger than your argument is such a boring one. The only fact that really matters at the end of the season is where you finish and where you felt you would have liked to finish. The only negative and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a common and often made point about Newcastle, you are a one club City and that really does make a huge difference when Villa park is 2 miles, WBA 5 miles, (Walsall 12 miles), wolves 17 miles and Coventry 20 miles from St Andrews. Consider that the closest clubs to the Sports Direct Park are Sunderland at 10 miles and then as I can see it Hartlepool at 25 with middlesvilla just a bit further down the road. My point is that competition for football is not really an issue to the extent that it is for us. It&#39;s not an excuse more an observation. 

Success for Newcastle this year will most likely look like top of the pile and promotion sewn up in March/April, beware the championship has a nasty trick of biting you on the bum in the new year.

Success for us was looking like 17th but I would imagine that with current form and the prospect of some acquisitions in January many a bluenose will be looking for top ten, although not silly enough to even think of Europe.</p>

-Birmingham is probaly 5 times as big as Newcastle, and have 2 premieship clubs.The fan base is probably in that ratio- due to recent History they just dont go.
- B&#39;ham  are planning to build a new 55,000- 60,000 stadium -Fact
- If Bham enjoy success they will fill the stadium.
-Newcastle do not have a bigger fan base,they just currently have more fans who attend games. If Newcastle were to stay in the championship for 20yrs(Like Brum) then your gates would go down to the 7,000 you were pulling pre Keegan- FACT.
-That Indian clown said Brum have never been in Europe.Brum have played in 2 European  finals, against Barcelona &amp;amp; Roma. -Fact
- I do consider Newcastle to be a big, at the moment, but if they do not get promoted this yr then it could be a slippery Leeds type slop.</p>
