<p>Well I think the first thing you have to say is Welcome to the Coca Cola Championship, Newcastle United. Today, a single albeit dubious goal from Dexter Blackstock saw off a Toon effort that just wasn&rsquo;t good enough on the day. My headline might suggest some haste in losing the game but in all fairness you have to give credit to Nottingham Forest for not laying back, and  indeed giving it their all against &lsquo;the biggest club in the league&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ve followed suit of Blackpool who before today, were the only team to have beaten us.</p>

<p>Although some decisions didn&rsquo;t go our way including a pretty blatant legit goal, we didn&rsquo;t really aid our cause. The first half wasn&rsquo;t anything special and we were punished a few seconds before the halftime whistle sounded.</p>

<p>The Forest fans were hounding everything that Newcastle touched and the atmosphere was one of anxiety. I suppose you could say Newcastle were unlucky and indeed Forest were fortunate to win this affair but we&rsquo;ve been proved, once again, that the Coca Cola Championship isn&rsquo;t a comfortable ride.</p>

<p>As I said in an earlier article, Forest wouldn&rsquo;t be easy and I was correct to say so. Saying that, should the goal that was disallowed have been awarded, and had Nile Ranger pelted his header into the back of the net, it would be a very different analysis.</p>

<p>However, we have to get used to this and come to expect it. Playing Newcastle United, for lower Championship teams is like a cup final, every week.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">You might well be right, if a little ungracious especailly to a team all be it a little off the pace in recent years, but one that has won more significantly more than you in the last 30 years, it takes more than a fantastic and large support to make a big team!
It really was a game off two halves and I for one thought your goal was legit until viewing the replays, where it was clearly marginally offside. 

I really do I hope you go back up at the 1st time off asking, you deserve to be in the permier league, but if you insist on being so condesending about more succesful teams than yours you deserve the same treatment that leeds are now getting.</p>

In terms of sucess you are nothing like a &#39;big&#39; club. You are in the championship for the same reason as we are. Both you and Forest are not in the premiership because we are not good enough. That means there are at least 21 clubs better than you or us. At least we realise that. You continue under the delusion that somehow you area big club in the wrong division. You are a well supported club in the correct division.Your report on todays match does not indicate that you were outplayed in the first half and could have been 3-1 down by halftime.

It really was a game off two halves and I for one thought your goal was legit until viewing the replays, where it was clearly marginally offside. 

I really do I hope you go back up at the 1st time off asking, you deserve to be in the permier league, but if you insist on being so condesending about more succesful teams than yours you deserve the same treatment that leeds are now getting.</p>

We were all over you first half, created plenty of chances and you would of thought we were the top dogs in the league, in the second half you saw another side of Forest, we digged in to get the win. You didn&#39;t really create any decent chances from all the possession you had. Nolan Goal was offside FACT, why would you get that decision some weeks, offside is offside and it was the correct decision. Newcastle are lacking a creative spark, afterall you haven&#39;t scored for a few games now.

Great performance forest, hard luck Geordies, best team won on the day, I remember in the 90&#39;s when you came down here when you was going for the league and you drew to hand the title to Man United. If memory serves me right your fans didn&#39;t take that result gracefully either.

For those comments that have been left regarding &#34;deluded&#34; geordie fans, well actually you couldn&#39;t be more wrong. As a season ticket holder i know i speak for the majority of fans when i say we know we are not good enough to be in the premier league, we know we do not have a divine right to be there and we know it is going to be very difficult to get back up there. We also know that it is the number of supporters we take to away games and have every other week at St James&#39;s Park that makes us a &#34;big&#34; club. Nothing else. Its the media and fans of other clubs, who for some reason spend half their lives reading about Newcastle United rather than their own teams (says something doesn&#39;t it :-)that keep saying we are a big club and should be in the premier league. Well on last years performances, no we shouldn&#39;t. On the players the club bought in and sold, no we shouldn&#39;t. So don&#39;t worry, Newcastle fans are under no illusions we are just going to enjoy this season and hope Mike Ashley does the right thing and gets out of toon. Just one last thing- of all the away games Newcastle have had this season so far, the attendances have been the highest of the season when Newcastle have been to town. I remember Ian Holloway after Blackpool beat Newcastle saying- &#34;message to the fans, you were brilliant tonight, but where were you last week and where will you be next week&#34;.

The fact that you have good support both home and away makes you a well supported club, not a &#39;big&#39; club. Your record over the years show you are at best a well supported average club.

&#34;The first half wasn‚Äôt anything special&#34;....it was a superb performance by Forest that merited at least one goal which was only dubious if you&#39;ve decided that all the replays are wrong. Just as a &#39;legitimate&#39; Newcastle goal was ruled correctly offside.

The fact that you have good support both home and away makes you a well supported club, not a &#39;big&#39; club. Your record over the years show you are at best a well supported average club. That is all. Don&#39;t be so arrogant.</p>

&#34;The first half wasn‚Äôt anything special&#34;....it was a superb performance by Forest that merited at least one goal which was only dubious if you&#39;ve decided that all the replays are wrong. Just as a &#39;legitimate&#39; Newcastle goal was ruled correctly offside.

I&#39;d like to say that newcastle are a big club which means that they have spending power and a fan base that any big club needs. If Forest&#39;s fans view that a big club only includes a team that has won trophies in the past, then I disagree. Forest have a special history, more special than most even in the Premier League but that doesn&#39;t mean they are a big club either. Football is all about the future and what a team hopes to achieve in the near future. Big clubs are the select few who have a chance to win anything in that near future, which rules out both Forest and Newcastle. Both teams belong in the Championship, nobody can deny.

As for the game, the best I&#39;ve seen on TV for ages. For me it says alot about how good the Championship is, not about how bad both teams are. Forest took the fight to Newcastle in the first half and deserved their lead. It could have been more but finishing chances hasn&#39;t been Forest&#39;s speciality this season, for example, Blackpool, Blackburn, Wednesday and West Brom just to name a few teams we should have beaten but didn&#39;t because we didn&#39;t take our chances. Newcastle could have brought it level on a few occasions throughout the game but didn&#39;t which for me just added to the excitement and tension as all Forest fans must have been feeling in the second half. But Forest hung on for the win. It means nothing more than 3 points though and we have every chance to lose to Barnsley on Tuesday as this really is a league where anyone can beat anyone else.

As for the article, keep it more factual and use less expressive language that leads to bias next time so as not to receive tirades like you received in this one. It wasn&#39;t a blatantly legit goal, it was offside. Our goal wasn&#39;t dubious unless you meant that Blackstock didn&#39;t actually mean to hit the target, which I&#39;m pretty sure he did. You didn&#39;t have any decisions go against you, actually one of the best refereeing displays I&#39;ve seen all season and Forest weren&#39;t fortunate to win this game, they won it fair and square, that&#39;s that. Contrary to popular belief, there&#39;s no luck in football. There&#39;s just human ability vs human error (including the ref) that decides the result. And Forest&#39;s ability was more than Newcastle&#39;s and the ref played no part in the result on this occasion. I just thought it was a great game and being a Forest Fan, I loved the result. Newcastle can still go up though they need strikers and a resolution to their off the field situation. But then I don&#39;t care about the Toon, sorry. It was another good result for the reds, another 3 points and a new dose of confidence to help us keeping playing well.</p>

 Forest know only to well that previous glories mean absolutely nothing when battling for results, look a Leeds United, they make no claims about being even the biggest club in the 3rd tier, why would they afford themselves to such deluded nonsense and disrespectful remarks? this merely ensures the opposition put in that little extra effort that can win games. Also maybe I&#39;m naive, but looking at Forest&#39;s performance especially in the first half they most certainly were not the fortunate to come out the winners. I honestly hope Newcastle are promoted this year, not least to appease their fans ego&#39;s but to rid the championship of it&#39;s &#34;Biggest Club&#34;. 
Nottingham Forest have integrity, WFT does Newcastle United have exactly?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I like Newcastle United, I like the passion of their fans, I like the fact that they have always represented all that&#39;s good about the game, however, it&#39;s quite a large however, the claim that Newcastle are the biggest club in the league is quite frankly inaccurate.
 Forest know only to well that previous glories mean absolutely nothing when battling for results, look a Leeds United, they make no claims about being even the biggest club in the 3rd tier, why would they afford themselves to such deluded nonsense and disrespectful remarks? this merely ensures the opposition put in that little extra effort that can win games. Also maybe I&#39;m naive, but looking at Forest&#39;s performance especially in the first half they most certainly were not the fortunate to come out the winners. I honestly hope Newcastle are promoted this year, not least to appease their fans ego&#39;s but to rid the championship of it&#39;s &#34;Biggest Club&#34;. 
Nottingham Forest have integrity, WFT does Newcastle United have exactly?</p>
