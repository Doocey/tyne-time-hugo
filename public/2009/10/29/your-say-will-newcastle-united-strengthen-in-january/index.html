<p>Now that Mike Ashley has decided to keep Newcastle United firmly within his grasp, reports are rife of players Chris Hughton is already lining up come January and when the transfer window opens again. Mike has promised to invest ¬£20m of his own money by the end of the week, and a lot of that is believed to be going into the transfer pot for Chris, although I find  that hard to believe. Today, I&rsquo;m giving you the chance to say who you&rsquo;d like and I know that list probably starts with Mike Ashley gotten rid of, but this is for players :D.</p>

<p>Just name the player, price and why you think the footballer should wear the Black and White of Newcastle United.</p>

<p><strong>Name :</strong></p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Name : Jermaine Beckford

Price: ¬£1.5M Leeds Utd (Cut price as in last year of contract)

Why: Reminds me of Andy Cole, he&#39;s proven he can score in League 1 &amp;amp; Championship and I personally feel he&#39;ll be capable of scoring in the Premiership.

Name : Per Cijan Skjelbred

Price: ¬£2.5M Rosenborg

Why: We&#39;ve been after him for what seems to have been an age, he has the creativity we lack in our midfield and is more than capable of scoring a few goals aswell. Also he&#39;s only 21 and is a Newcaslte supporter.

Name : Erik Huseklepp

Price: ¬£2.5M Brann

Why: We were after him last year and in the summer, has a number of admirer&#39;s with Chelsea been linked to a bid before transfer ban. Basically this kid has what we lack on the wings, crosses and goals, one of them players who can turn nothing into something.

Can&#39;t think of any others I would like but these 3 players we have been linked with loads, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we bought them. But also would as Ashley bit stingey on the dosh. Can&#39;t think of any defenders that I would like except from Song from Arsenal but thats it.</p>

He has told you already in his own statement that he is not buying nay players.  He said he is investing 20 million in the next week.............well, saying as he cant actually buy any players till january and he is investing it next week, its safe to say he is not (as usual) investing a penny in the squad. Its a known fact that he has to pay off 12 million with immediate effect to reduce the barclays loan to under 10 million - its the rules and we are at 22 million right now. So that leaves 8 million.  3.2 million goes to KK and that leaves 4.8 million.  Thats about 5 spins of the roulette wheel for fatty.  Why the fcuk everyone thinks he is going to buy any players is beyond me ffs! houghton is looking at getting a loandeal on carl corts 30 year old brother - who is shit, does that sound like mike is investing??  does that sound like we have any chance of ever getting out of this div (in an upwards direction that is)?  No, it does not.  Also, you have to remember and face up to the fact, that if we dont do it this season we will have no chance next, cos many of the players that are at ours currently will move on in the summer if we dont go up - smith and nolan and also taylor etc.  they will all leave and rightly so. So, obviously they will be replaced with total shit players as thats ashleys plan anyway. 

As for this actual blog topic - i would like to see us get vinnie jones and get him to kick the shit out of ashley.</p>

Yes it`s unfortunate and short sighted, the main goal should be to gain promotion, that`s where the money is, there`s little revenue to be had in this league and the longer we stay here the more difficult promotion will become.
The one thing MA said that you can take to the bank is, in admitting he is no footballing expert.
I would like to know in that case, from where does he get his advice ?
Hopefully not from Llambias, the blind leading the blind.</p>
