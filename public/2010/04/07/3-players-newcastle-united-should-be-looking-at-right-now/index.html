<p>The vibes coming from the hierarchy of Newcastle United are very encouraging ones indeed of late, and Mike Ashley is seemingly doing the impossible, in becoming a slightly better owner. For now anyway. A season in the Coca Cola Championship has given us time to think about things on Tyneside and the goings on at the club while at the same time, perched on top of the  table, ready for regaining our Premier League status. With our spot in the top flight already sorted, it&rsquo;s really time to be looking at new players to bring in because we without a shadow of a doubt, need to strengthen our squad for the upcoming Premier League campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Tyne Time</strong>, on the button as usual has compiled a quick list of 3 players that we think would fit the bill at Newcastle as we look to make the most of our upcoming Premier League season.</p>

<ol>
<li>Jamie O&rsquo;Hara</li>
</ol>

<p>If you visit Tyne Time regularly then you&rsquo;ve probably seen this lad&rsquo;s name mentioned a few times. Jamie O&rsquo;Hara, currently at Portsmouth on loan from Harry Redknapp&rsquo;s Spurs. With O&rsquo;Hara, Pompey would be worse off for sure, the Englishman has won games for the Fratton Park side this season, although very little at that. With Tottenham boasting the likes of Wilson Palacios, Luka Modric, Niko Kranjcar, David Bentley and even former Toon midfielder Jermaine Jenas - I really do wonder where O&rsquo;Hara fits in here. As much as Harry preaches about him having a future at White Hart Lane, I think he&rsquo;ll be off to a new club if anywhere near £5m comes in for him. With Chris Hughton having already worked with him at Spurs then surely there&rsquo;s a good relationship between the two? I think there would be, and I&rsquo;d certainly love to see the CM strut his stuff at St.James&rsquo; Park next season, along with so many other Magpies fans.</p>

<ol>
<li>Roque Santa Cruz</li>
</ol>

<p>Roque Santa Cruz arrived at Manchester City with a very big price tag and if memory serves correctly, hasn&rsquo;t played as many games as the number of millions he cost from Blackburn Rovers. With Craig Bellamy, Emanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tevez shaping up very well I fail to see where Cruz fits in. Unless Mancini plays 4 upfront with 2 in midfield or at back, than maybe he&rsquo;ll get games but a subs appearance would be the best &lsquo;Santa&rsquo; could hope for at City as of now. As well as this, Cruz was a Mark Hughes signing and as you know, he&rsquo;s long gone, with him, the enthusiasm of many of his signings including Mr.Cruz. We need a proven goal-scorer and given the chance, I&rsquo;m sure Cruz, 28, could bang a few in at the Gallowgate End. With Manchester City in no real need of money I think an offer in the region of £5-8m should prize the Paraguayan away. A very long-shot indeed but worth bringing. Do you think Santa Cruz would ply his trade at St.James&rsquo; Park?</p>

<ol>
<li>David Bentley</li>
</ol>

<p>David Bentley was another former Blackburn player under Mark Hughes but since his move to White Hart Lane, we haven&rsquo;t see anything like what was promised on his arrival for £17m, like we&rsquo;ve seen at Spurs on many occasions. An English international and a masterful footballer if in the right frame of mind. Yet again I&rsquo;ll refer to Spurs large &lsquo;reservoir&rsquo; of good midfielders and although Bentley has got more playing time than others, I can&rsquo;t help but think no-one would stand in his way if he wanted to join another club. I&rsquo;d be delighted if that club was Newcastle United because he&rsquo;s a real skillful midfielder as we&rsquo;ve see many a time. He did cost £17m though and Spurs, if they agree to sell, will look to recoup a large chunk of that, certainly into double figures. Another long-shot indeed but these are the players I&rsquo;m sure Hughton is keeping an eye on. An offer in the region of £9-12m should get Daniel Levy thinking.</p>

<p>And I haven&rsquo;t even come to defenders yet..</p>

<p>Above, are 3 players I&rsquo;d really like to see at Newcastle United this summer and in time for the new Premier League season. These are my choices, you might not agree and indeed you might. That&rsquo;s what the comment box is for, get your suggestions in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny to see that in January, I wrote about possibly bringing in Peter Whittingham , Nicky Maynard or indeed Bill Sharp to see out our promotion push. Well, we are a Premier League team again and with it, brings better funds, and a better reputation, not that we never had it at Newcastle 😀</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the players are still out of our range, I don&rsquo;t know. If only loan spells, I would like to think they&rsquo;d consider Newcastle United, especially if they&rsquo;d be sitting on the bench at their parent club!</p>

<p>Comments welcome as always 🙂</p>

Perhaps we needed a second season in the Fizzy to dispel our delusions that had the club stacked up with useless trophy signings?  £8m for Robbie Keane is still £4m too much and utterly inconsistent at that.  Harewood on a free would score more goals.  

We need to be MUCH better wheeler-dealers than this, and look very carefully at avoiding the wage spiral that left us virtually crippled in May 2009.  Ask yourself would Arsenal buy any of these players?  Answer NO!!  So why should we?</p>

watched skjelbred a couple of times,must say i didnt like what i saw, looks slow on the ball and seems to dissapear to often in games.

santa cruz will surely be injured a few times during the season and could prove to costly in my opinion.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">How we fans love wasting Cashley&#39;s money, and will then cry foul when these prima donnas lie around injured for 60% of the season before leaving on a free.  Perhaps we needed a second season in the Fizzy to dispel our delusions that had the club stacked up with useless trophy signings?  £8m for Robbie Keane is still £4m too much and utterly inconsistent at that.  Harewood on a free would score more goals.  

We need to be MUCH better wheeler-dealers than this, and look very carefully at avoiding the wage spiral that left us virtually crippled in May 2009.  Ask yourself would Arsenal buy any of these players?  Answer NO!!  So why should we?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">id say get seb larsson in, his in contract trouble with birmingham,can play right back too,did so for sweden in the last national fixture and didnt put a foot wrong, sweet right foot and not a diva.

watched skjelbred a couple of times,must say i didnt like what i saw, looks slow on the ball and seems to dissapear to often in games.

santa cruz will surely be injured a few times during the season and could prove to costly in my opinion.

dorrans i would like.

o´hara i havent seen play so got no opinion.

as i am from sweden i would like to see Kallstrom from lyon in CM for newcastle.no nonsense player with great attitude ,powerfull shot and great crosser,always works his socks off.</p>

Secondly,we should gor for Albin,his contract expires this season and look surely to be a good PL player.
Last i would love to see keane to newcastle as he have a good scoring abillity and think he will cope well with Lovenkrands at the front.</p>

Gotta say i&#39;m not a fan of Bentley at all and wouldn&#39;t want him anywhere near St. James&#39;.

Robbie Keane would be a good signing but the matter of £60-70k a week wages is just not viable, the same with Santa Cruz and Bentley.. Unfortunately them days have passed where we would splash out countless amounts of money on transfers and wages. Our club is being ran as a business where we aren&#39;t gonna sign 28-31yr old players on superstar wages.... The new stratergy seems to be signing players under the age of 26 and on wages of less than 30k.. For me, I would get Kris Boyd(Rangers), Beckford(Leeds).Both are 26 and are free transfers in the summer. The likes of Dorrans from West Brom could be a good signing. We need a class centre midfielder with lots of creativity, unless we have scouts out scouring the world for something in our price range, I think we are gonna be stuck with the mediocre none creative championship midfield we have at the moment, which is a sad thing to say....</p>

We,ve just had a year to look at some of the teams in the lower divisions, we could also start to look for young talent from abroad.
Dorrans would be a good signing but the Baggies aint gonna sell him after they go up!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">we should give tim krul a chance in goal. i think kilgallon from sheff wed would be a good signing and would go well with mike williamson. luke young right back ? or maybe even rafael on loan? apparently man u are putting him on the loan list. ohara good signing central midfield with nolan, jonas and routledge on the wings and i think robbie keane would be an excellent signing with andy carroll upfront as carroll would team up with someone with good positioning such as robbie keane. sell leon best pancrate and loan out ranger.</p>
