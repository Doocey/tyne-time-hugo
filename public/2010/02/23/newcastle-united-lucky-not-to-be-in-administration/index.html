<h3 id="mike-love-him-or-loath-him-he-s-kept-nufc-in-a-financially-stable-condition">Mike - Love him or loath him he&rsquo;s kept NUFC in a financially stable condition</h3>

<p>You only have to look at Portsmouth FC to see what the economic recession is doing to football. Stoke City&rsquo;s 1-2 win against Avram Grant&rsquo;s side was rumoured to have been the last ever game played in Fratton Park, however whether this is true or not, I really don&rsquo;t know. Either way, Pompey are in a serious financial mess at the minute and the signs for the future are not good at all.  With a winding up order chasing them around for the last month, whether the final straw in the 2008 FA Cup winners, has been well and truly pulled we&rsquo;ll see in a matter of days.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t feel guilty about this as Magpies though. After all, we tried to help them, dishing out ¬£1m for Mike Williamson. That however, is only a drop in the ocean of the funds needed to keep this club above board.</p>

<p>As much as you can fault Mike Ashley for ruining this club and dragging us into the Coca Cola Championship, we could very easily be in the situation Portsmouth find themselves in. Relegation is a huge disappointment for all sectors at a club. With the likes of Michael Owen, Mark Viduka, Damien Duff, Habib Beye and so forth all earning huge money from the club, it was unsustainable to keep them lads at the club.</p>

<p>Not only that though, the likes of Coloccini, Jonas, Barton, Smith, Ameobi, Taylor(s) all still earn a wage that most league 1 clubs wouldn&rsquo;t dish-out to their entire staff in a week. Footballers are over-paid for sure, but I won&rsquo;t be getting into that because I might only reduce some Toon fans to tears with the facts!</p>

<p>Mike Ashley&rsquo;s reported ¬£25m loan to the club is reported to keep this club running and pay the players. Ashley wanted to sell a few times now but couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable buyer, however in fairness he kept the club on it&rsquo;s feet with the money both generated from transfer fees and some of his own cash.</p>

<p>Many suggest he pocketed the sales money from Shay Given, Damien Duff, Obafemi Martins and so forth but I really do doubt it. Very easily, Newcastle United could&rsquo;ve been history. It&rsquo;s just lucky that we are where we are in the table, aloft the Championship and looking good for promotion. Mike Ashley is as keen as any Toon fan out there to get promoted, and especially to avail of the juicy TV revenue deals and the many other sources of income.</p>

<p>Here in my own country Cork City who once harvested the likes of Kevin Doyle, Ipswich&rsquo;s Damien Delaney, Roy O&rsquo;Donovan from our neighbours Sunderland, Dave Mooney now on-loan at Charlton and even Reading&rsquo;s Shane Long, folded as a club today and were officially no longer a football club.</p>

<p>This is never nice to see and it&rsquo;s becoming more and more prevalent nowadays with Crystal Palace now under the control of administrators. Thank God it hasn&rsquo;t happened here on Tyneside and with a Premier League return, we&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;d never ever happen. However, there&rsquo;s always a chance in the current climate.</p>

<p>On a different note, Peter &lsquo;Free-Scoring&rsquo; Lovenkrands is expected to make the trip to Watford and that&rsquo;s very good news indeed. Three points at Vicarage Road would be even nicer üòÄ</p>

Yes we have had lies and mismanagement but after all of that we are still viable as a business.
Week after week the chant echo‚Äôs round the ground commenting on Ashley‚Äôs continued presence at the club. If we are realistic he is the club custodian, a rich man with an expensive toy. The continued abuse will only isolate him from the club which will be negative. Yes I am sure many people will disagree with me but it may be time to say you have made mistakes but repent and come back to the fold. NUFC are one of the greatest clubs in the world. The fan base is without doubt the most loyal and passionate (and I am proud to have supported the club for over 35 years). But we need someone who is prepared to support the club at a financial level which will deliver what the fan base deserve. No matter what your thoughts of Ashley are he has shown the potential to support the club to level that is required.</p>

Like a house, it ain&#39;t what you pay for it, it&#39;s what it costs to put right when the central heating goes wrong or the roof blows off.   Unless NUST have TWICE the face value of the club in the bank they should walk away now, because that is the minimum contingency they will need to guard against the nervous banks seeking administration at the slightest hiccup.

This bone-headed profligacy verged on financial negligence; all at the final expense of the season ticket holders, or the expense of the city itself if the club went under.  It never brought a trophy, and simply stored up huge problems for the future, problems that would have sunk the club without a billionaire such as MA as owner.

What the last year has done is reveal the true state of this club to its supporters, and yes we still have the shouters hurling abuse at Ashley (and yes he has been s*** at times) - but a year in the backwaters of Fizzy Pop football has done this club no harm at all if we are brutally honest. And, if we learn to start winning away as well, we might add some genuine silverware to the cabinet - if anyone can remember where the key was last put......</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Totally agree with the above sentiments, well posted guys :)

As for the current crop of players, I think they&#39;ve done us a service with the way they&#39;ve gone about their jobs to get us back into the PL at the first time of asking, the only problem we have is how much it&#39;s costing us to keep them, now I know Ashley has put in a wage cap of ¬£15k per week in the Fizzy &amp;amp; ruomurs are that will raise to ¬£30k per week if/when we get back to the PL, I am just wondering if the so-called high earners like Smith, Nolan, Barton, Colo etc will be asked to drop their wages to that amount to stay with the club or be sold to make way for fresh talent on lower wages??

If the rumours are to be believed, all the above named have been courted by PL clubs this past season, so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to shift them out if we needed to freshen up &amp;amp; lower the wage bill as well, so will Ashley do that or will he do his usual act &amp;amp; put u up for sale again come the soummer, especially if promotion is guaranteed??</p>

He then hired the fool Wise to try to stop K.K bankrupting the club and then asked Shearer to keep us up without any experience. All of this was to try to please us fans. This season however he has stopped his tactic of appeasement and started being a proper chairman by making the right decisions and backing C.H with good but inexspensive players. I agree that he should give a full public appology to the fans and I dont think he should sell in case we end up with Pompeys&#39; Al Faraj. He should go back to his original strategy and devolpe quality youth players in our academy and look at making us great again in the long term as opposed to the short term blinkered view that Sheppard had. Also If Platini gets his way then we would be in a great possition if the top clubs have to sell players to get their wage bill under 40% of their income. Finally Liverpool, Arsenal and Man.U, are in dire financial straights and are being kept afloat by loans and if Roman walked out on Chelski they would be F****D so i think we have a lot less to worry about than most of the biggest teams in Europe.

But whether he wants to sell, remains unclear, being he is a very private person in regard to business.
I was of the opinion he would sell at the first available opportunity, but not so sure anymore.
For instance he certainly looked elated following the last win, high fiving all around him.
He has reintroduced the system of bringing in young prospects, not something a short term ownership would be interested in and in general appears to be enjoying the success of the club.
Those signs plus the reported introduction of a business plan in regard to both a salary cap and an age limit on signings.
Why would an owner wanting to sell bother with any of those measures, seems more likely an indication of a projected long term relationship to me.
But i have been known to be wrong before !</p>

We have never even been close to administration. The money from the transfer windows over the last two season have ensured that Ashley has made a nice healthy profit from NUFC.

Did you know that some of the original land that Ashley acquired when purchasing NUFC has been sold for a pittance to one of Ashleys own satellite company&#39;s ? He will make a handsome profit on this land when redeveloped. He may be a fat cocknee bastard but he knows how to rip people off.

Many things need to change at the club.
Appointing non executive directors from the true support would act as guidence so the same mistakes are not made.
We can be a top club again but its going to take a long time to get to that position.
Our performance on the pitch has only shown how poor this league is. We need to start planning long term in a youth policy with players who not only have the skill but the hunger.
No matter what your views of ma are he hold the key to the new begining.</p>
