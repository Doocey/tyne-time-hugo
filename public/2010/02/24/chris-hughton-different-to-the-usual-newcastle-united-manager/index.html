<h3 id="chris-different-type-of-manager-who-keeps-to-himself-and-gets-on-with-the-job">Chris - Different type of manager who keeps to himself and gets on with the job</h3>

<p>Top of the Coca Cola Championship and pretty much a healthy squad with very little injuries. This is a line you wouldn&rsquo;t associate with Newcastle United too often but it&rsquo;s the story of our season so far. 12 goals in our last 3 at home and our strikers scoring with ease, for now anyway. Although Leon Best hasn&rsquo;t hit the net yet, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time and Vicarage Road would be an ideal  spot for him to do so. A lot of this comes down to our boss, Chris Hughton. The Irishman has worked relentlessly with the lads through the turmoil that surrounded the club last year. He trained them, got the pre-season fixtures ready and brought some discipline into the squad. He is now reaping the benefits of his hard work now.</p>

<p>As my headline suggests, Chris Hughton is different to anything Newcastle United as club have had before. Our usual manager, togged out on the sideline with suit and tie and standing on the sideline motionless as Newcastle cruised to victory <strong>attempted to lure all three points.</strong> Chris Hughton is a manager who looks more like a player, fully kitted out in the training gear and animated per usual in his technical area.</p>

<p>The likes of Joe Kinnear, Sam Allardyce, Alan Shearer, Glenn Roeder and so on had different tactics and different ways of motivating their players. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say out of all the three, Roeder did the best job in his first season on Tyneside! üòÄ</p>

<p>That said, it&rsquo;s not only Chris Hughton physical appearance that is different to what we;re used to. He trains the lads hard, explains what he wants and indeed what he expects from them. He demands 110% from every player and if he doesn&rsquo;t see it, he&rsquo;ll soon replace them.</p>

<p>Mind you, he&rsquo;s probably the first Toon manager in a long long time to succeed in the job, although our job is far from finished here in the Championship and one man knows that more than anybody. Personally, I&rsquo;m a fan of Hughton. I know that&rsquo;s easy to say taking our league position and form into account but I have always supported him. His tactics might not be wonderful away from home but he&rsquo;s not a smug manager and is willing to change the team around should the system not work properly.</p>

<p>Even if we don&rsquo;t get promoted this season (God forbid) you cannot fault Chris Hughton. He&rsquo;s worked under serious conditions at some stages and has taken criticism in his stride on Tyneside. As Alan Shearer said today, Hughton has done a great job and deserves a crack at the Premier League. We do look set for an immediate return but whether we will have the same owner come May, and whether they&rsquo;ll look to keep Chris Hughton only the future will tell.</p>

<p>However, he certainly does deserve a chance and if Mike Ashley is the Newcastle United owner next season, I think he&rsquo;ll hand Chris the job to keep us up in the Premier League without a shadow of a doubt. Who knows though?</p>

I can believe u think we will get relegated next season with this spirit in the team I dont think we will look at teams in EPL except Manure, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Spuds, Villa, Everton. No one has a better squad than ours and u all sat we will be relegated. Its about the spirit that is what will drive us on.

He may know how to shut up shop and absorb pressure away from home but he struggles to adapt, this would see us struggle in EPL.
I do agree though that he deserves to be given the chance in EPL ...IF we get there after all, his contract expires at the end of next season ,and I think he should be given till then to prove himself (assuming he gets a few points on the board early doors to give confidence).
One of the problems he may face is when he is given money to improve the squad....his choices so far have been varied in their successfulness, and his handling and motivation skills with superstars (if we get any) is untested this season but , failed miserably last season (under somewhat different circumstances though)!!!!!!

Hughton had 7 games in charge last season, and won only 1 point (albeit in difficult circumstances) ‚Äì an average of 0.14 points per game.  Joe Kinnear (who I think we will all agree is no Wenger / Mourinho / Ferguson etc) managed 23 points from 20 games ‚Äì an average of 1.15 points per game.  Both managers had the same squad of players and faced the same difficult circumstances prevalent at the club.

Suddenly decide they know more about the game than a guy who has spent his entire life either playing as a pro.or coaching and now managing.
Yeah I know it`s just a blog where people can exchange opinions about their team, but to criticise Hughton and make the claim he does`nt know what he`s doing, just defies logic.</p>

Suddenly decide they know more about the game than a guy who has spent his entire life either playing as a pro.or coaching and now managing.
Yeah I know it`s just a blog where people can exchange opinions about their team, but to criticise Hughton and make the claim he does`nt know what he`s doing, just defies logic.</p>

When a fan puts forward the opinion that Hughton isn‚Äôt the right man, that isn‚Äôt the same as that fan saying that they ‚Äúknow more about the game‚Äù than Hughton.  When I criticise Hughton, I‚Äôm not necessarily saying that I could do a better job myself, or that we should sack him and appoint a random supporter or blogger instead (I thought that this went without saying).  I‚Äôm comparing him to other managers and concluding that I don‚Äôt think he is good enough to be manager of a club of the size and stature of Newcastle United.  I look at other teams who I think we ought to be competing with, and who they have as their manager (e.g. O‚ÄôNeill at Aston Villa, Moyes at Everton, Hodgson at Fulham) ‚Äì men who have track records of success as managers at the top level over a number of years.  I want someone who overachieves with the resources at their disposal.  Someone who commands respect throughout the football world.  Someone who can attract the right players.  Hughton doesn‚Äôt fulfil any of those criteria.  Had we been doing exceptionally well right now (e.g. if we were 15 points clear, on a cup run and playing good football), then perhaps I would have warmed to him.

Was`nt it Shearer that got us relegated ?
three points from  the last eight games, not exacly a sterling record.
And how can you critisise a manager who took the remnants of a relegated team stripped of its best players and made them into a cohesive group with self esteem and to-getherness at present leading the league.
Guess you just dont want to give the guy the credit he deserves, for some unknown reason?
You mention managers with track records, M. O`N.
he was offered the job here and turned it down.
As for Moyes he was given an opportunity at Preston when they were in Div 1, yes he brought them to the championship, not a big deal , I remember them as a 1st. division side, a decent manager but has accomplished nothing yet.
In order to have a track record you have to first get the opportunity to manage and Hughton is doing pretty good right now.</p>

That‚Äôs 0.375 points per game, which is nowhere near good enough and a factor in why we were relegated.  But, as I said in my earlier post, Hughton won 1 point from 7 games.  That‚Äôs 0.14 points per game.  You say Shearer got us relegated, but it is undeniable that, of the four(!) managers we had last season , Hughton was the most culpable of them all ‚Äì the figures are undisputable.  In my opinion, they all have to take a share of the responsibility, including Keegan, Hughton, Kinnear, Shearer, Ashley, Wise, the players ‚Äì everyone.  

I agree that we were stripped of some of our best players.  But once the summer transfer window closed and we still had Harper, Taylor, Coloccinni, Enrique, Jonas, Smith, Barton, Carroll, Ameobi etc. in the squad, it was clear that automatic promotion would be a minimum requirement.  So lets not get carried away at the fact that we might reach our minimum requirement.  As for the team spirit thing, that is just a natural consequence of winning games and being at the top of the league ‚Äì all due to having by far the best squad in the league and resources that our competitors can only dream of, rather than anything Hughton has said or done.  

I‚Äôd be happy for Hughton to get an opportunity at being a manager, to cut his teeth, learn his trade and gain some experience - but not at Newcastle United.  That‚Äôs because I think that all managers should start in the lower leagues and work their way up to a club like NUFC.  I want NUFC to be a place for proven winners, not novices trying their hand at management.  But then, I want us to strive to be the best we can be, whereas others are satisfied with mediocrity.</p>

As for &#34;NUFC to be a place for proven winners, not novices.....&#34; I can&#39;t see it happening while this owner is here and tbh it&#39;s probably a blessing in disguise considering what&#39;s happening to the likes of Pompey. Saying that though I want the best at SJP and for a while we did have, I can&#39;t see when we will again though afterall this guy never even authourised a replacement for Emre and sold promising young players like Milner and N&#39;Zog etc.

Surprised we were relegated, no, I hate to say it but we deserved it, why, because of the owner and his decisions and his appointments. Getting us back into the prem is a start but we have to be a challenge to other teams and not just also rans. The real work will begin in the summer if we are promoted, Hughton will certainly have a job on his hands and I wish him good luck and truely hope he&#39;s successful.</p>
