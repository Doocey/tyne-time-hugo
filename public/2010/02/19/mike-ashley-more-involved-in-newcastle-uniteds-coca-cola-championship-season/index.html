				<p><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01349/mike_ashley_1349947c.jpg" alt="Mike Ashley" title="Ashley - Seems to be working in a close relationship with Chris Hughton" /></p>

<p>In a season that has saw our owner Mike Ashley try to sell but failing miserably yet again, however finally deciding to establish a tad of stability at the club. By that, it meant selling players, keeping some and after a long debacle as to who would be the full-time manager of Newcastle United, appointing Chris Hughton the former assistant of Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer (alongside  Iain Dowie). Hughton has since guided us to a pretty decent season so far which sees us top of the Coca Cola Championship, as we enter the final stages of what&rsquo;s been a long season, and it&rsquo;s still not over.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the fine run of form that Chris Hughton and the players have been on throughout the season in general has indeed helped strengthen the relationship between Hughton and Mr.Ashley. If results weren&rsquo;t going too well, what kind of relationship or scenario on Tyneside we&rsquo;d have, I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>As much as we don&rsquo;t like Mike Ashley for his disastrous running of the club since his arrival, we must say that the January transfer window and the funds allocated to Chris Hughton were quite pleasing, even though we did miss out on a very promising player in the shape of Victor Moses. We managed however to get in Mike Williamson, Wayne Routledge, Patrick van Aanholt, Fitz Hall, Leon Best and Danny Simpson. As well as that, we finally offloaded ¬£60,000 a week Geremi to Turkish side Ankarag√ºc√º.</p>

<p>At any club, in any sport, a healthy working relationship between both the manager, players and the hierarchy of the club is essential if you want to be successful organization. Of late, Mike Ashley hasn&rsquo;t done too much wrong, but maybe that&rsquo;s because he hasn&rsquo;t done a whole lot at all! üòÄ</p>

<p>Either way, long may the healthy bond continue and more importantly, let the lads focus on promoting this mighty club to the Premier League.</p>

Personally I think Doocey has written a decent blog here &amp;amp; I have to agree that if we hadn&#39;t sold off ¬£40m in crap players, we&#39;d be doing what Leeds have done &amp;amp; Pompey are doing as we type, so if you can&#39;t make sensible comment, don&#39;t bother commenting moron</p>

We as supporters have to bear the brunt of the blame really. Mike has put so much money in to the club and he&#39;s lost so much through no fault of his own. I think we should give him a chance. I think we should give Hughton a chance, I think we should give me a chance and peace a chance cos really none of it FUCKING MATTERS does it?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Aw, leave the man alone. I mean....we&#39;re top of the league so he can&#39;t be all that bad. And anyway its not all his fault is it? We as supporters have to bear the brunt of the blame really. Mike has put so much money in to the club and he&#39;s lost so much through no fault of his own. I think we should give him a chance. I think we should give Hughton a chance, I think we should give me a chance and peace a chance cos really none of it FUCKING MATTERS does it?</p>

It looks as if we will be going back up in May, providing we don,t start losing games and being too arrogant about opposing teams ( like against The Rams ). There are a lot of teams fighting to go up and it could if we are not careful go wrong for us!

As far as FA is concerned, i worry about his intentions after promotion. He has been extremely naive if you look at some of the decisions made in the last two years.
Hopefully we won,t turn into a yoyo club and come back down the year after, which for me would be a doom scenario!

They need to build in a wage structure, and keep to it in the Premiership! No ridiculous signings and over the top wages for arrogant Prima Donna,s who don,t produce on the pitch. In the last few months we have been lucky that some of the other results have gone in our favour.
I,me hopimg that Ashley is not gonna screw up the club again after Promotion!</p>

However, the incentive to re-shape the unsustainable high spending ethos of the club (a legacy from the FS trophy signing days and before) would not have been there if we had missed the drop.  

Without MA&#39;s rescue of this club, the NUST group could only dream.  They could not have bought the club off FS as it was riddled with black holes of hidden debt, debt that MA has had to take on the chins.  To his credit, he has, and we were sailing very (very) close to administration but for his private fortune.  NUST could not have done this, and the club would have collapsed very quickly.

Whatever the future of the club is, and whatever the faults of Ashley are, time will show that he alone proved to be the lucky soft financial landing that our disastrously out of control club somehow managed.  He is millions out of pocket on this, several tens of millions to be precise, money that all the toon faithful put together could not have afforded to stump up.  He could have walked away, he didn&#39;t, and as a result we are seriously daring to look again at the Premiership instead of floundering at the bottom of the Championship with a 10 point deduction and half the current remaining squad sold off.  Fair&#39;s fair here, MA has the guts admit he made huge mistakes last year, but he has also the bollox to put his hand in his pocket to put them right.  

I&#39;ll never the like the guy, but I&#39;m learning to respect his methods a little more.

Freddie Shepherd may have backed his managers with the funds for big name signings, but the money was not his, it came from increasing the club&#39;s debts and spending years of sponsorship money in advance.  He also indulged in business deals which were advantageous to associates of himself and costly to the club.  He then made a substantial profit from the sale of NUFC to Mike Ashley.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I believe we will get back into the P.L. this time running but sorry i don`t agree with the Chris is great brigade,some of the decisions made this season have been mind boggling and if we had a manager with an ounce of tactical nous we would be all but promoted by now.I also don`t agree with the old&#34;it`s the points that matter&#34; garbage either,some of the football played at SJP this season has been the worst since Charlton was here-i`m only a small lad and my neck is hanging out from looking at the high balls all the time.I`m expecting to get slagged off here but i`m a NUFC fan and a football fan,i pay a lot of money which i cannot afford on my season ticket as i have done most of my 43 yrs-but i am exactly that A FOOTBALL FAN i love football,rugby`s not my game so play fekin football.
    I`m not having a go at any individual here,Chris is a smashing bloke-i`v met him so believe me he`s a smashing bloke but i don`t think he`s a manager.Ashley has an idea which i agree with in principle,i`d love to see youngster after youngster come through playing exciting passionate football but the Arsenal had a good established team before Wenger spun his magic,it was also a slow transformation-he didn`t do it over night by emptying the club of players bleeding it dry and getting them relegated. As for bailing us out of the crap-it is ONLY his own fault,he acted like a playboy clown and did not follow protocol and made both us and him look like fools and probably tarnished his business reputation beyond repair.Granted we are looking a lot better financially than we have done in a long time but this is by fault and not design-he didn`t want nor intend to do this,he was stuck with it.
 The team needs a massive overhaul if we get promoted and massive financial investment which will not be forthcoming,at times this season we haven`t looked good enough for the championship-the premiership will eat us alive with the current batch no matter how hard they try.
  That`s just my opinion &#34;stand by for incoming&#34;
