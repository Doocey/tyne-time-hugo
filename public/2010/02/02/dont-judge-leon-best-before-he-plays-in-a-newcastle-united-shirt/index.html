<h3 id="best-some-toon-fans-concerned-at-the-signing-of-leon-by-chris-hughton">Best - Some Toon fans concerned at the signing of Leon by Chris Hughton</h3>

<p>It seems if a lot of Newcastle United fans have already formed opinions on our new signing, Irish international Leon Best. Having watched Best on many occasions, although he&rsquo;s no Alan Shearer he certainly has the potential as Hughton rightly said, to make a good striker. Signing from Coventry for a rumoured fee of 650k, Best was Newcastle&rsquo;s deadline day signing , getting in a striker after missing our on Victor Moses. Indeed I believe the Victor Moses scenario has played a huge part in some fans negative attitude to Best, even though he hasn&rsquo;t graced the pitch in a Black &amp; White jersey yet.</p>

<p>What I am saying, is give Leon Best a chance at Newcastle United. He is determined to do well for the club and more importantly, is honoured to pull on the Toon jersey, and there&rsquo;s been a lack of players with the same attitude as Leon, in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Having scored 10 goals at Coventry City already this season, in what&rsquo;s been an in and out season for the Sky Blues, Best has been performing well. He&rsquo;s quite good at headering the ball and if anyone saw his goal against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, you&rsquo;ll know he can finish give half a chance.</p>

<p>Best is a different player to our usual Andy Carroll, Shola Ameobi and Nile Ranger, he&rsquo;s quite pacy and hopefully, will cause some problems to Cardiff&rsquo;s defence in the upcoming titanic clash at St.James&rsquo; Park.</p>

<p>Time will tell, but for just over half a million if even, Best is worth a shot and if he&rsquo;s even a third of the player that namesake George Best is, then we have a right gem on our hands. Somehow I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be that good!</p>

<p>I must say I&rsquo;m not a fan of YouTube compilations as they&rsquo;re no way to judge a player, (as Dennis Wise found out) but, I do advise you take a look at Leon Best&rsquo;s goal v Portsmouth in the FA Cup ¬†only a few weeks back.</p>

Antoine Sibierski was one of the most berated signings and he went on to become abit of a cult hero. Im sure Hughton knows more about the player than the fans who say he&#39;s not good enough, so im gona trust the Newcastle manager. 

He shrugged off Enrique at the Ricoh...may have got abit lucky with it but left me astounded.</p>

We&#39;ve signed alot more players then we could have hoped for and only 1 out...the financial drain aka as Geremi.....they may not seem to be of the quality we&#39;d like but lets give them a chance or shall we go back to wasting millions on the likes of Luque and Boomsong???.....HTL</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Kieran there&#39;s no way Ashley would have paid that amount of money and as for the tribunal its highly unlikely they&#39;d have set the fee at ¬£2m and anyway I believe they are only for players under 23 yrs of age(apologies if I&#39;m wrong).......like the article says give him a chance,he has a better strike rate this season than all our current strikers,playing for a team currently in the bottom half of the league.
We&#39;ve signed alot more players then we could have hoped for and only 1 out...the financial drain aka as Geremi.....they may not seem to be of the quality we&#39;d like but lets give them a chance or shall we go back to wasting millions on the likes of Luque and Boomsong???.....HTL</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">The fee will almost certainly be around ¬£1.5 million. I&#39;m pretty certain Leon Best was still covered by the tribunal up until the end of this season. 

Considering we paid Southampton around ¬£1million at the tribunal a couple of seasons back we would at least expect the same again minimum. We also rejected a ¬£3million bid for Westwood on deadline day. This shows that we are only willing to sell at the right price. The chairman is on record at the start of the window saying we wouldn&#39;t sell Leon for less than ¬£1.5 to ¬£2million. I see no reason why we would sell unless you matched what we could expect to receive in the summer.</p>

We could have kept him till the end of the season and still picked up ¬£1million&#43; off anyone who wanted him. 

Also why would we sell our number one striker for peanuts with no time left in the transfer window to sign a replacement, unless there was a financial incentive.  

Anyway good luck for the rest of the season! Van Aanholt is a good lad and should do well for you. I think while we had him though that there was a clause meaning he had to play when he was available, might be the reason why you only have got him for a month.</p>
