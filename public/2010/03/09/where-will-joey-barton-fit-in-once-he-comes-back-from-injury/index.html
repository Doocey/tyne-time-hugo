<p>The recent performances of Danny Guthrie have been nothing short of fantastic as the former Liverpool midfielder continues to prove that he&rsquo;s more of an asset in centre midfield. Guthrie scored twice on Saturday and both were from distance. He&rsquo;s also got important goals this seasons like our home tie against West Brom, in the 2-2 draw. The forlorn figure of Joey Barton will  reappear from Newcastle United&rsquo;s dressing-room in the next week or so but I can&rsquo;t see him breaking into the Toon starting 11 straight away anyway.</p>

<p>Barton has had problems and we know that more than anyone, however, he&rsquo;s managed to stay a Newcastle United player through all the regimes on Tyneside and has kept his ¬£60,000 wage-packet close to him too. Saying that, Joey&rsquo;s a talented footballer and I really hope he can show us some of that potential in the run-in to the Coca Cola Championship season.</p>

<p>Alan Smith, Guthrie as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, and even Nicky Butt will look to claim first team spots but no doubt Joey will be eager to be named on the starting 11 as soon as possible. I suppose if we can get promotion looking a certainty in the next month or so, we can ease him back into the action and let him get ready for what&rsquo;ll be a vigorous Premier League campaign. <em>if</em> we get there.</p>

<p>Either way, it&rsquo;s good to have options in midfield more than anything and our midfield is indeed providing goals for our front men which is always a good thing.</p>

<p>Do you think Joey Barton will walk his way back into the Magpies team?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">He always takes about 5-6 games to get back into top form so should be eased back in gradually. I do think that he is better than Nolan and Smith and instances like the Swansea game where we were outpassed until Guthrie cut inside in the last 10 minutes wouldn&#39;t happen with Barton on the pitch.

However he takes 5 games to get to his full potential, plays a few blinders then gets injured again. Should be his last chance fitness wise really. Shame, abit like Emre, fiery midfield with bags of talent, but always in the treatment room.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I&#39;d like to see a midfield of Barton and Guthrie if Barton can get back in form. I see him as a better box to box midfielder than Nolan and whilst he not play as high and get as many goals he will be bossing the game about and allowing our wingers and Guthrie to do their job. Barton box to box, hard tackles an incisive passing. Danny creates space, passes well, has a good free kick and shoots from way back. Nolan likes to be in the box for goals, is a big lad and not afraid to be the hard man and brings experience to a team that is getting younger and younger. They all offer something very different.

I don&#39;t know what the future holds for Smith who just cannot score a goal but he will be useful in Away games and whenever we need that extra man in front of the defence. Whether that is worth paying 60g a week for, when far more talented players are on less is very debatable.</p>
