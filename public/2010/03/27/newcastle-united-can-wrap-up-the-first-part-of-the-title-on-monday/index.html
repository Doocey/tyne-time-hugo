<p>West Bromwich Albion seem to love scoring in the last <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">15</span> <strong>5</strong> minutes of their games as we&rsquo;ve seen them ditch their 1 point for a more desirable 3 in the dying minutes of many a game this season. Graham Dorrans has been in flying form this season and will no doubt have caught the eye of a couple of Premier League teams in the process of keeping West Brom&rsquo;s automatic promotion  hopes alive. If you ask an experienced Toon fan and &lsquo;blogger like me, the title is all but Newcastle United&rsquo;s. üòÄ</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since Newcastle United lifted a trophy and we can&rsquo;t really class the Coca Cola Championship (should we win it outright), as a major piece of silverware. Instant promotion was mandatory for some of Newcastle&rsquo;s higher earners.</p>

<p>Some will say that I&rsquo;m being a tad arrogant saying that we&rsquo;ve one hand on the trophy but I usually don&rsquo;t say things like this unless the signs strongly suggest it. There&rsquo;s no chance we&rsquo;re not getting promoted this season.</p>

<p>Chris Hughton deserves a lot of credit for getting this side into shape and the only real blip we&rsquo;ve had came in the last week, with Andy Carroll breaking Steven Taylor&rsquo;s jaw in a little scuffle at training. Carroll then scored at the Keepmoat Stadium to ensure we stay top.</p>

<p>Tyne Time on Tour in Tyneside will be landing down in Newcastle early tomorrow and on Monday, will hope to see our grip strengthened on the Coca Cola Championship title. If we lose, we need 3 more wins, if we win it&rsquo;s as good as ours. We won&rsquo;t even consider the draw eh?</p>

I agree that Hughton deserves a lot of credit after an uneasy start,but both our teams do need a lot of strengthening for the Premiership.
I&#39;m not a fan of Billy Davies,but with the resources he has at Forest,i think they have done very well,and you could argue that there position is the biggest achievement of the top three.
We really should not mess up second from here,but history shows that we did catch Wolves a few years ago when they had a similar lead and then they lost in the play-offs.
Congrats to Newcastle though,your fans deserve Premiership football and you are very close,i bet a few fans are glad that you stuck with Hughton now and didn&#39;t sack him after the start of the season!</p>

However, I could see Forest messing up somewhere on the play-offs should they end up in them. West Brom will buy in the Premier League and have some players at the club already looking good for the Premier League. Dorrans, Miller so on. We hope to see you in the Premier League!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Haha John, I&#39;d say it will be Brom, ourselves and Forest going up. However, I could see Forest messing up somewhere on the play-offs should they end up in them. West Brom will buy in the Premier League and have some players at the club already looking good for the Premier League. Dorrans, Miller so on. We hope to see you in the Premier League!</p>

I agree, whoever goes up (us wbrom and  A N Other) will need to strengthen, but thats obvious, no team who wants to stay in that league does not strengthen once promoted, we will see by ashleys dealings if he wants us in the prem, however, it has to be said (through gritted teeth by me) ashley has got it right this season, and i hope he continues next season in the same vein, rather than make the mistakes he made 2 seasons ago........time will tell though !!!!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">No chance of the toon not returning to the big time league. We have been very comfortable virtually all season and will stay unbeaten all season at SJP. I&#39;m looking forward to Monday&#39;s game, might be tougher than people expect, Forest have got pace up front, but their run away from home recently has been shocking, they miss McKenna in the centre of the park.
When we do get promoted, we do need some strengthening but not a radical overhall. We should mainly stick with the current crop of players as they have been wonderful this season. Harper, colo, jose, jonas, guthrie, nolan can all cut it in the prem. Carroll and lovenkrands can cause problems for prem defences and Carroll may prove to be a real handful for top defenders. @NUFCELITE i think Dorrans would be a good signing, he is creative, but doubt he would leave WBA to go to us, if he were to leave it would be to an established premiership club i believe</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I think we will win Monday and then we can start the preparations for the party. 13 points clear of Forest with a game in hand will be too much for them.

On next season, we need to understand there will be no big money deals. We need a proven striker for the Premier League but who can we see for the right money? Carlton Cole would be a dream for me, but we only have a chance if West Ham get relegated and even then there will be clubs that Carlton would rather go to approach him.

Jamie O&#39;Hara, Tom Cleverley, Chris Eagles should all be able to get and add midfield spark which is what we need and then we need to look for a quick striker to put next to Carroll. Proven quality too. Want establish a Shearer/Bellamy like partnership, in that mould. Lovenkrands I like, but we need someone more proven to start.

I think Steven Taylor will be sold after the latest controversy so defence reinforcements will be vital.</p>

He has a five year contract and lets face it, if/when he leaves us he&#39;ll go to a big club with at least ¬£10m spare and who are likely to finish above us next season. Given you fit none of those criteria and we&#39;ve played you off the park 3 times this season i&#39;m sensing you may have to &#39;wrestle&#39; elsewhere.

Good luck Monday and glad you think the title is all but sown up!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">&#39;wrestle Dorrans off West Brom&#39; ha ha ha. How? He has a five year contract and lets face it, if/when he leaves us he&#39;ll go to a big club with at least ¬£10m spare and who are likely to finish above us next season. Given you fit none of those criteria and we&#39;ve played you off the park 3 times this season i&#39;m sensing you may have to &#39;wrestle&#39; elsewhere.

Good luck Monday and glad you think the title is all but sown up!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I&#39;d much rather focus on just getting a result in the next game than think about us getting promotion or even winning the league for that matter.

What&#39;s most important is to get promotion this season, although it would be nice to win something for a change, WBA can have the title for all I care, as long as we get promoted.

Don&#39;t forget WBA will be supporting Newcastle as John W said above, they will be wanting us to beat Nottm Forest, so we will be doing them a favour if we win.

I don&#39;t want to change anyone&#39;s ambitions or attitudes, I&#39;m just saying, it will be better off if we just focus on our own game, and let everyone get on with theirs. I don&#39;t see the point in trying to prove anything to anyone else, because as soon as you start doing that you just go as low as them.

Arsenal fans seem to be the role models these days, probably because of Arsene Wenger&#39;s influence, but it&#39;s best to be civil towards the opponent as you can then generally gain the upper hand if you start it, although I&#39;m sure a bit of banter is just fun anyway.

Anyway, just saying. Go toon!</p>

 &#39;he‚Äôll go to a big club with at least ¬£10m spare and who are likely to finish above us next season. Given you fit none of those criteria and we‚Äôve played you off the park 3 times this season &#39;

Oh dear somebody bites dont they. A win at home against our youth team in the cup and two draws, oh teah your right you deserve the title mate. By the way we have a Centre Half that cost ¬£10M, do any of your strikers cost ¬£10M I wonder? Sour grapes my friend.</p>
