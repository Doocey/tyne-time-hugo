<p>Foolish, selfish, ridiculous, childish, stupid, outrageous and more than anything, arrogant. The Andy Carroll story. Reportedly he&rsquo;s after breaking Steven Taylor&rsquo;s jaw in a Sunday training session and I needn&rsquo;t say anymore. Disgraceful from a Geordie born lad who was making great strides this season. Now however, his season is over as far as I&rsquo;m concerned and he&rsquo;ll be extremely lucky to  remain a Newcastle United player too. This is just utterly disgraceful and nothing less.</p>

<p>I really can&rsquo;t understand all of it but I knew at first sight that the story the Daily Mail was very close to accurate for a change. Carroll has been in trouble lately over a nightclub incident and indeed last season over his fist-throwing at Charles N&rsquo;Zogbia.</p>

<p>Sounds familiar eh? Joey Barton springs to mind and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Andy turned out the same because he simple doesn&rsquo;t seem to appreciate the life he lives. A great player yes, an increasingly poor reputation.</p>

<p>Just as we thought Joey Barton was calming down a bit one of our leading strikers is making the headlines for the wrong reasons today. Perhaps he was seriously aggravated by something Steven Taylor said because I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t a random belt. Taylor is no angel either and we&rsquo;re expecting to hear a lot more over the coming days.</p>

<p>The reason it&rsquo;s arrogant is because we&rsquo;re top of the table, looking good for promotion and coming into the crucial part of the Coca Cola Champions campaign. This could upset the camp at Newcastle and we could lose tonight with the whole embargo hanging over the players.</p>

<p>Andy Carroll will definitely not be playing tonight and just as it seemed Steve Taylor was on the mend, he&rsquo;ll be out for another few weeks, thanks to Carroll of course. Perhaps I&rsquo;m being a bit harsh but I can&rsquo;t get over the arrogance from Carroll here. You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d just address Taylor in a normal fashion rather than going breaking his jaw. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>Big game tonight, bad news surrounding the club and all about Steven Taylor texting Andy Carroll ex-girlfriend apparently. I&rsquo;ll say no more..</p>

1) The club suspend both players for the rest of the season and 1 player is sold

You have no idea what has happened between these two guys or how the injury was inflicted. 

How do you know that Carroll was in the wrong and not Taylor or for that matter how do you even have the clarity that the injury resulted from a blow by Andy. The training pitch and the dressing room are rough environments and things can get out of control or be taken out of context. 

Opinions and Arseholes - everybodys got one but some people like to show theirs off without thinking. 

Just let the grown ups resolve this one. If the lads guilty then I&#39;m sure there will be appropriate action but the last thing we need right now is Harry the Hysteric and His Lynch Mob.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Carroll has arguably been the biggest benefactor of our relegation, what with the opportunity that gave him to break into the first team.  I assume that this has led to him mistakenly believing that, because he‚Äôs scored a couple of goals, he must therefore be invincible.  He obviously lacks the brains to recognise that he has been extremely lucky to get the opportunities and exposure he has had of late ‚Äì some are even talking about him being looked at by Capello and given the NUFC No.9 shirt!  But believe me, he‚Äôs no Alan Shearer ‚Äì far from it, in fact.  He has done OK in the Championship, but he has got a long, long way to go before he can be considered to be a proven, Premiership standard striker.  He has (or should I say ‚Äúhad‚Äù?) a chance to establish himself as a decent player, but his lack of a brain and disgraceful attitude can only result in career suicide.  He‚Äôs only 21, and yet he‚Äôs already been cautioned by police for assaulting a woman about 18 months ago,  he‚Äôs about to stand trial for glassing someone in the Bigg Market, and there was the training ground fight with N‚ÄôZogbia.  And now he‚Äôs broken Taylor‚Äôs jaw whilst already on bail for the other assault.  He really needs to hope that Taylor doesn‚Äôt make a complaint to the Police, because the Crown Court certainly won‚Äôt be impressed with him committing another offence whilst already on bail, and serious consequences could follow i.e. imprisonment.  I appreciate that we don‚Äôt know ALL of the facts, but there is no excuse for punching a team mate no matter how much winding up went on, plus he has too much previous for something like this to just be casually overlooked.  

I really hope that this is dealt with properly by the club, and I endorse Doocey‚Äôs suggestion that he should be suspended until the end of the season and then shown the door.  I‚Äôd also like to see him forfeit his wages for the duration of that suspension, and pay Taylor‚Äôs wages for the extra time he will spend out injured, and pay a fine to the club to compensate for being unable to field Taylor for the extra time spent injured (and perhaps Taylor needs to be fined too, depending upon exactly what has gone on).  I think this might help Carroll to learn about the consequences that flow from his moronic actions.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Carroll has arguably been the biggest benefactor of our relegation, what with the opportunity that gave him to break into the first team.  I assume that this has led to him mistakenly believing that, because he‚Äôs scored a couple of goals, he must therefore be invincible.  He obviously lacks the brains to recognise that he has been extremely lucky to get the opportunities and exposure he has had of late ‚Äì some are even talking about him being looked at by Capello and given the NUFC No.9 shirt!  But believe me, he‚Äôs no Alan Shearer ‚Äì far from it, in fact.  He has done OK in the Championship, but he has got a long, long way to go before he can be considered to be a proven, Premiership standard striker.  He has (or should I say ‚Äúhad‚Äù?) a chance to establish himself as a decent player, but his lack of a brain and disgraceful attitude can only result in career suicide.  He‚Äôs only 21, and yet he‚Äôs already been cautioned by police for assaulting a woman about 18 months ago,  he‚Äôs about to stand trial for glassing someone in the Bigg Market, and there was the training ground fight with N‚ÄôZogbia.  And now he‚Äôs broken Taylor‚Äôs jaw whilst already on bail for the other assault.  He really needs to hope that Taylor doesn‚Äôt make a complaint to the Police, because the Crown Court certainly won‚Äôt be impressed with him committing another offence whilst already on bail, and serious consequences could follow i.e. imprisonment.  I appreciate that we don‚Äôt know ALL of the facts, but there is no excuse for punching a team mate no matter how much winding up went on, plus he has too much previous for something like this to just be casually overlooked.  

I really hope that this is dealt with properly by the club, and I endorse Doocey‚Äôs suggestion that he should be suspended until the end of the season and then shown the door.  I‚Äôd also like to see him forfeit his wages for the duration of that suspension, and pay Taylor‚Äôs wages for the extra time he will spend out injured, and pay a fine to the club to compensate for being unable to field Taylor for the extra time spent injured (and perhaps Taylor needs to be fined too, depending upon exactly what has gone on).  I think this might help Carroll to learn about the consequences that flow from his moronic actions.</p>
