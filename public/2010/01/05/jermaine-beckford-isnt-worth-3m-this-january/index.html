<h3 id="beckford-not-worth-more-than-2-5m-this-january-transfer-window">Beckford - Not worth more than ¬£2.5m this January transfer window</h3>

<p>Fair enough, he scored the winner against Manchester United in the FA Cup a few days ago, granted he&rsquo;s got 20 goals for Leeds United already and we&rsquo;re just leaving Christmas but Jermaine Beckford isn&rsquo;t worth the ¬£3m Leeds United are reportedly looking for. With Newcastle expected to sign Beckford soon after submitting another, written transfer bid, it would be a risky  transfer if we ssplashed out near four million pounds on a League 1 striker. I&rsquo;m sure some will disagree and think he&rsquo;s well worth every penny, but considering he&rsquo;s out of contract in only a few months, I don&rsquo;t think that, that kind of money should be thrown at the 6&rsquo;4 striker.</p>

<p>Hughton is meant to have also bid for Matthew Kilgallon who, to be honest, will be less hassle to prise away from Bramall Lane. If you told any Newcastle fan two years ago that we&rsquo;d be looking to sign Jermaine Beckford &amp; Matt Kilgallon in the near future, they&rsquo;d probably laugh at you and ask who Beckford was. However, that&rsquo;s what it has come to, and I&rsquo;m sure there wouldn&rsquo;t be many complaining if we sign both of the lads.</p>

<p>Some are saying we should be looking to Kris Boyd and I must say, he&rsquo;d probably be a decent signing. However Middlesbrough are extremely close to sealing a deal for the Scot or so reports claim, early this Tuesday morning. Either way the main focus is on Beckford throughout Tyneside and it looks as if Hughton will splash out ¬£3m for the 26 year old striker.</p>

<p>Not worth the ¬£3m if you ask me, but then again Chris Hughton is the boss.</p>

However, if we were to sign Beckford now, If he gets say, 5-10 goals from now until the end of the season, that would certainly see us automatically promoted. Especially when you think that Nolan&#39;s 10 goals are largely the reason we are top at the moment.

People doubt whether Beckford will be able to cut it in the premier league but its certainly worth trying, you can never be certain how a player will cope until he is actually playing.

When you also consider the strikers we already have, Lovenkrands, Ameobi, Carroll and Ranger all came for nothing and 3 of them through the youth team, then 3 million for Beckford who is more of a natural goalscorer than all of them, doesn&#39;t seem to unreasonable.

I don&#39;t think there are too many decent alternatives to him in our current situation. If he isn&#39;t firing by this time next year in the premier league then by all emans look to sell him or at least loan him out. There won&#39;t be any shortage of takers...</p>

Problem is there`s a sell on clause which gives them only a percentage of the fee received.
And if no one meets the asking price they could attempt to re sign him.
A dangerous game, they could lose him for nada.
However i believe we will sign him for around two million.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I am firm in the belief that Newcastle will not pay anythng more than 2-2.5 million for the player.

I am rather shocked at the attitude of a lot of people who claim he may not be able to cut it in the PL or even the championship?

Yes..it was only 1 game on sunday; but did he not give Wes brown the complete run around? The same wes Brown who has played for Man Utd and England for many years now? 

2-2.5 million does not buy you a lot in the market these days; but a player with pace, potential and in his prime whom is hungry to prove himself sounds like a &#34;gamble&#34; that i and CH would certainly look to take.

As for Kilgallon; he is a fine young English player just entering his prime; very much in the mould of phil jagielka and everyone has seen how well he has gone on to do with everton.

I think this article is rather derogatry to both players and the club. I could name at least 10 PL teams who would take both players in their squads. To sign the pair for less than 4 million combined represents great business and with a litle success in the PL: but players could go on to command transfer fee&#39;s in excess of 10million each being english and still at a good age!</p>

Like somebody mentioned, why dont we look at Billy Sharp and Gary Hooper instead. Im sure they are just as good, if not better and probably not full of their own self importance. Didn&#39;t this club used to have some &#39;big time charlies&#39;, and look how well we did then.</p>

Like somebody mentioned, why dont we look at Billy Sharp and Gary Hooper instead. Im sure they are just as good, if not better and probably not full of their own self importance. Didn&#39;t this club used to have some &#39;big time charlies&#39;, and look how well we did then.</p>

He has shown no desire to leave Leeds, he hasn&#39;t asked for a transfer just simply doesn&#39;t agree with the terms offered.
