				<p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/10/24/1256413692446/Peter-Whittingham-of-Card-001.jpg" alt="Peter Whittingham" /></p>

<p>As the speculation mounts about Jermaine Beckford, alongside the price, I think it&rsquo;s worth taking a look at other players that Newcastle United should really consider making inquiries for. All the media hype has been about Matthew Kilgallon &amp; Jermaine Beckford and I&rsquo;m sure about 96% of my articles this new year are revolved around the Sheffield United centre half and the  Leeds United hitman. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s many players out there vying for a move to Newcastle and below I&rsquo;ve put together three players which I think would be worth a shot at St.James&rsquo; Park.</p>

<ol>
<li>Peter Whitthingham</li>
</ol>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that <strong>Peter Whittingham</strong>, although not a striker, is on red-hot form this season. Cardiff have had a mixed season so far but still linger in a healthy position. A lot of it comes down to Michael Chopra and this guy, Peter Whittingham. He&rsquo;s already racked up 15 goals in all competitions with 13 of them coming in the Coca Cola Championship. Not half bad if you ask me. We don&rsquo;t know what Cardiff would ask money-wise for him, if they would be forced into selling him that is. I think ¬£4 - 5m would prise the 25 year old ¬†from The Bluebirds.</p>

<ol>
<li>Billy Sharp</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Billy Sharp</strong> is only 23 years of age but has already played for a whole host of clubs. From Sheffield to Scunthorpe and back to Sheffield again, this season, we can see why the Blades forked out ¬£2m for him, only 2 years after letting him go for about ¬£100,000. Sharp&rsquo;s netted 10 goals already this campaign for Doncaster and proven to the fans why Sheffield Utd did indeed pay millions for him. In a good run of form with Doncaster, I&rsquo;m sure neither the Blades or Sharp could turn down a move to Newcastle United, the league leaders. Although a life long Sheffield fan, I&rsquo;d fancy our chances of signing the 5&rsquo;6 striker.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nicky Maynard</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Nicky Maynard</strong> needn&rsquo;t score a more spectacular goal than his effort against QPR a few weeks ago to secure interest from teams across the country. A wonderful goal to say the least and not a one hit wonder either. Maynard has bagged the same amount as Kevin Nolan (10) and to be honest, I think he&rsquo;d be worth having a look at. He&rsquo;s only 23 and seems to have a lot left in him. I rate him in the same bracket as Jermaine Beckford and he&rsquo;s certainly one of the best strikers in the Coca Cola Championship at the minute, in a Bristol City side that&rsquo;s picking up form all the time.</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s my three players that I think are worth a shot, and as good as Beckford to say the least. They&rsquo;ve all scored double figures this season and I&rsquo;d be confident they&rsquo;d seriously consider an offer from Newcastle United. So Chris, if you&rsquo;re reading, do take notice because these are three talented lads and might not cost ¬£3m either.</p>

Its Leeds fault they didnt tie the player down earlier on so i cant see how they expect ¬£3m for a player where they will get nowt for in the summer.</p>

Doocey...nice article, good to see someone doing an article not replicating a news report. Whittingham is a skillful player and certainly has new potential and Cardiff are apparently in financial trouble. 

Billy Sharp certainly can score goals but Sheff Utd must have saw something he hasnt got for them to pay so much and hardly play him. 

As fas as Maynard goes, havent seem him play but what a goal he scored and wouldnt mind some of that at St James. 

I am abit sceptical about Beckford as the press and Leeds fans say he needs three strikers id prefer Billy Sharp probably.</p>

He has scored goals in League 1 and the Championship, Hes looking great at the minute and never really gets the praise his goals deserve!

Whittingham is a good call though, Cardiff do have finan&#39;cial troubles although hes rated very highly by them, I would go him either now or even in the summer if we get promoted, He&#39;d be great on our left side, We could alse try Jonas on the right too...See if it helps his end product :)</p>

Whittingham is a good call though, Cardiff do have finan&#39;cial troubles although hes rated very highly by them, I would go him either now or even in the summer if we get promoted, He&#39;d be great on our left side, We could alse try Jonas on the right too...See if it helps his end product :)</p>

Can&#39;t help but think Whittingham would be snaffled from under our noses by bigger and better prospects at the minute. Maybe next season if we go up and show some promise.

Aye Billy Sharp knows where the goal is down at these levels but could he cut it any higher? Got me doubts.

That Maynard goal was a bit special eh? Kept watching it over and over again...
Another one who might be a gamble at a higher level, but might do a job getting us there at least.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">How come nobody seems to mention Joe Ledley?????

For me; he is twice the player Whittingham is and any cardiff fan will tell you he is the player that makes them tick; it is just whittingham&#39;s goals this season whcih are grabbing the headlines.

What some of you may not know is that Ledley is out of contract at the end of the season; just like Beckford. If we could snap him up for 3-4 million pounds then we would have a real player on our hands!

I thought Maynard was extremely poor at st. james this season when up against decent defenders; he didnt get a sniff!

I&#39;d go for Ledley, Beckford, Kilgallon and Moses.

Buying those four players will save us millions in the future and i believe all four will go on and prosper in the PL in years to come.

Ledley can provide from the left which we have lacked since the Ginola/Robert days, bringing in Ledley will be more of a benefit to Ameobi and Carrol.

As for Boyd DJG is completley right in what he is saying has got CL expierience good international goal scorer and an excellent striker in the SPL, i think hed much welcome a move to NUFC over the smoggies as i cant see them getting promoted if they lose Johnson.

Defender wise extend Simpsons loan and sign him in the summer as hes a free agent, and look for another loan siging at center half, because Kadar has shown promising signs that he could be a big prospect for the future.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Leeds bigger than Newcastle? Your having a fair dinkum laugh!

Here in Australia our Newcastle supporter base is massive. Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal dwarf us but we still have some clout. Leeds had some fan spike when Viduka and Kewell played for them but like good bandwagoners most are have dropped off them when relegation hit. Not Newcastle, in fact Newcastle fans have seemed to increase since relegation here in Australia.

Anyway, the point is Newcastle are a much bigger club than Leeds, anywhere around the world. 

As for our transfers.....

I like Beckford but not for ¬£3m, no way known. Why not put in a tad more for Victor Moses at Crystal Palace? He will be a massive player in the future. Also why hasn&#39;t the name of Miles Addison from Derby been mentioned? Young and really has all the potential in the world. Will be a much better player than Kilgallon. Both players have massive potential to develop into good Premier League quality.

With Tamas Kadar developing nicely I have more confidence in him being a backup for us and with Barton back soon playing Nolan in a more advanced role, we don&#39;t need to overpay for players in January. I would like signings no doubt for depth and insurance to get out of this damn division, but lets not overspend now and regret it in June.

Also we need to keep investing in young talent for our academy. The one thing Ashley did well at the beginning is get in some good young talent. Nile Ranger coming through is evidence that system works. Getting Aaron Spear was a massive coup that was seriously underrated.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Leeds bigger than Newcastle? Your having a fair dinkum laugh!

Here in Australia our Newcastle supporter base is massive. Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal dwarf us but we still have some clout. Leeds had some fan spike when Viduka and Kewell played for them but like good bandwagoners most are have dropped off them when relegation hit. Not Newcastle, in fact Newcastle fans have seemed to increase since relegation here in Australia.

Anyway, the point is Newcastle are a much bigger club than Leeds, anywhere around the world. 

As for our transfers.....

I like Beckford but not for ¬£3m, no way known. Why not put in a tad more for Victor Moses at Crystal Palace? He will be a massive player in the future. Also why hasn&#39;t the name of Miles Addison from Derby been mentioned? Young and really has all the potential in the world. Will be a much better player than Kilgallon. Both players have massive potential to develop into good Premier League quality.

With Tamas Kadar developing nicely I have more confidence in him being a backup for us and with Barton back soon playing Nolan in a more advanced role, we don&#39;t need to overpay for players in January. I would like signings no doubt for depth and insurance to get out of this damn division, but lets not overspend now and regret it in June.
