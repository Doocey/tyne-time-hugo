<h3 id="simpson-the-deal-is-not-totally-dead-according-to-reports">Simpson - The deal is not totally dead according to reports</h3>

<p>Newcastle fans are describing the transfer of Danny Simpson as one of the most important steps Chris Hughton will take this season. The Manchester United RB has been on-loan since last year and has impressed the Geordie fans with his performances and especially, his attitude. However, the move has stalled because of Danny&rsquo;s wage demands. As I wrote yesterday, NUFC supposedly  have a wage-cap for the Coca Cola Championship campaign in place, and Simpson&rsquo;s desired wage packet stretches beyond the limit.</p>

<p>The Journal reported that the deal was dead yesterday but have another article <a href="http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-simpson-deal-not-dead-4466052" title="today">today</a> claiming that the transfer could well take place yet. As I said, if Simpson is looking for too high of wages then there&rsquo;s not much the club can do but decline.</p>

<p>However, the question really is, what is his wage demands? We&rsquo;re not sure what he is on at Manchester United but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not a bad pay-packet at all. As well as this, a lot of United fans were calling for Danny to be recalled to solve their full-back problem which was effected badly by injuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúDanny is in the right frame of mind to play on Monday night, even though it might be his last game for us.‚ÄúAs part of the agreement, his last game is on Monday, but Danny is a very good professional week in, week out and I would not anticipate any problems with his frame of mind.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added :
&gt; <em>‚Äú<strong>Negotiations are taking place</strong>, and they are always very private. Sometimes it does not end up that way, but the starting position has to be it is private between the player and the negotiator.‚ÄúDanny has done very well for us and we are hopeful something will happen. It is probably getting a little bit boring I suppose.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>Chris does seem optimistic that the Englishman could still arrive however, senior sources at the club (who?!) are reported as far from optimistic. Some Toon fans are calling for his wages demands to be matched because it&rsquo;ll mean Premier League promotion will increase wage-demands all around the club either way.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what the scenario is at St.James&rsquo; Park but we do know that Danny Simpson will play against West Brom, in what is probably the most important game of the Coca Cola Championship campaign.</p>

<p>If we get a win at home to the Baggies and indeed win our following game after that, then you can&rsquo;t help but get just a tad excited about the prospect of winning the Championship outright. However, we&rsquo;ve seen throughout the years that you&rsquo;ll usually end up disappointed if you get excited about Newcastle&rsquo;s chances in any competition.</p>

<p>Our hope at the minute really is that Danny Simpson becomes a permanent Newcastle United player, and as quickly as possible. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get a surprise and he + a few others will sign soon. Dreams eh? üòê</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Im not too sure what the problem is hes quite established in the team and done very well this season with colo taylor and enrique. surely paying a bit more in wages would justify the small fee we have agreed to sign him permanantly rather than having to go and spend a few million in the summer for a new right back doesnt make sense to me.</p>

With promotion comes in most cases an overall raise in both wages and outgoing but also a serious raise in revenue.
The bean counters are now more numerous than the football people on these blogs, amazing really how the ownership has managed to co-opt these people and get them to blog showing a concern in regards to what is affordable and whats not.
Screw the money, I just want to see a good team out there and to hell with parsimony.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Simpson is a mediocre player, so if he is asking for anything more than mediocre wages, he should be told to sling his hook.  In every game he has played for us he has been pretty much anonymous - admittedly not an altogether bad thing for a defender.  But compare him with our other full-back, Enrique.  Enrique really struggled throughout his two seasons in the Premiership with us, and yet he is one of the Championship‚Äôs top performers.  Simpson is fairly average at Championship level, and he hasn‚Äôt given one performance in a black and white shirt that might suggest he will be able to cut it in the Premiership.  And you have to wonder why Man U didn‚Äôt want him back despite having the biggest defensive injury crisis we‚Äôve ever seen, preferring to play midfielders in defence rather than recall an actual defender.  Hardly a ringing endorsement for Simpson.  The bottom line is this ‚Äì he isn‚Äôt a Premiership player, so isn‚Äôt worth Premiership wages.  He‚Äôll be ok for us until the end of this season, but if we get promoted we‚Äôll end up in the same, familiar position - paying big wages to a player who is utterly useless in the Premiership.</p>

another place to look is Scotland.Celtic seem to be having a lot of problems keeping players(with the mass exodus in the last few days!)players such as Mcgeady,Hinkel and Crosas would be quality additions to our squad.rangers two most promising youngsters John Fleck and Danny Wilson have both rejected new contracts,and look likely to leave.These would be quality additions!
