				<p>###¬†Kilgallon - Staying at Bramall Lane until end of the season</p>

<p>Chris Hughton will now have to readjust his January transfer target and his main man, Matthew Kilgallon has said today that he&rsquo;s staying put at Sheffield United. Kilgallon, who was expected to make the move to us this January has opted to try and push for promotion with the Blades and reassess his options in the summer. In fairness, you&rsquo;ve to credit the lad there, he wants to  stay and hopefully achieve promotion with manager Kevin Blackwell. That now rules Kilgallon out of the Toon scenario and as Chris Hughton said earlier, he wants to sign a striker and a centre back, I wonder has his ambitions changed?</p>

<p>His agent said :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&lsquo;We have spoken to Kevin Blackwell to say Matthew is fully committed to Sheffield United until the end of the season,&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&lsquo;We have also informed Newcastle United about the situation.</em></p>

<p><em>&lsquo;Matthew is keen to win promotion with Sheffield United, if that happens we will re-assess the options in the summer.&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps now Hughton will look elsewhere or we certainly hope he does because I doubt Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor will stay fit for the remainder of the season. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll hear many new names being touted about and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a few loanees arrived instead.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t fault Newcastle on this one, they acted quickly to get their bid in and Matthew simply wanted to stay. Good to see there&rsquo;s some loyalty left in football yet.</p>

Kilgallon was the one player I wanted us to get this January, He&#39;s quite cultered and good on the ball, There aren&#39;t too many good central defenders available in England these days. I remember watching him on the first game of the season against the smoggies and he was a rock.

Tons of top quality  Championship defenders have gone on to be great in the premier league, Roger Johnson, Michael Dawson, Joleon Lescott, Phil Jagielka, James Collins, Michael Turner and Kilgallon is of the same mould as all of those...

Hopefully we can pick up someone else, Cleverley and Fryatt wouldn&#39;t go a miss either! :)</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Let&#39;s look positively at this scenario! we have the two best centre half&#39;s in the division. Does anyone else think that other than greed; killgallon&#39;s decision may have been partly due to the fact he would be sitting on the bench when colo and tayls are fit? 

We have a fine up and coming central defender in Tamas Kadar. Let&#39;s bring Zurab back in until the end of the season on loan as cover for Tayls, collo and tamas. He can play full back as well so it will give us options. This would save us money to reinvest on a striker and a creative midfielder.

I watched maynard play live at st. james this season and he did not get a sniff. If i recall it was zurab and stephen taylor playing central defence that day. I&#39;ve seen far better attacking players at st. james this season.

He has pace; but for me the champioship is his level and i think all four of our first team strikers are better players; not to mention the fact bristol city value him in the 5 million and above bracket (as he has plebty of time to run on his contract).

Not to beat the stick to much on it; but how about Joe Ledley? The best creative player in the division. Stoke city tried to buy him for 6 million in the summer. His contract runs out at the end of the current campaign and we would get him for a snip of that. 3-4 million pounds for a player who will thrive in the PL will be a bargain.</p>

With you on Joe Ledley, also I see another Cardiff player, their young full back Adam Matthews who I mentioned some days ago is in a similar situation but manure and the arse are sniffing  after him.</p>

With you on Joe Ledley, also I see another Cardiff player, their young full back Adam Matthews who I mentioned some days ago is in a similar situation but manure and the arse are sniffing  after him.</p>

I&#39;d take Ledley right now but he has struggled with injuries this season and thats the last thing we need..Maybe trying to seal a deal for Cleverley and or Ledley at the end of the season would be best.</p>

doocey;think your loyalty bit is way of the mark,at end of season no t/fee so he can get a nice fat signing on fee in his pocket and nowt for club smacks a bit of greed to me not amb could be me thinking evil 

----

Perhaps it is but I&#39;m just being kind to the lad.
Either way, if he left now or in the summer, he&#39;d be getting a bigger contract. He could have left this January if he wanted and earned more from now until the summer.
Just my thoughts.

Ledley is a very good player but one very much sough after, we&#39;d have to act awful quickly to get him if we were looking at him.</p>

I don&#39;t think Ashley would be paying over-the-odds for his wages, so he&#39;ll get significantly more by running down his contract. Combine that with the inevitability that he&#39;ll be behind Taylor and Colo, and that assuming the form continues, he could be for the rest of the season. The result for me would be that the agent has steered him toward the most lucrative deal for himself on that basis.

Perhaps he doesn&#39;t have the desire to come and fight for his place, and maybe money talks.

Or he could just genuinely want to stay at Sheff Utd. I think we all know that latter is the least likely, but it&#39;s the one the agent is harping on about, predictably.</p>

I know it was only one game but against us he was an absolute rock and looked knackered from lack of match practice but still made crazy runs up field from centre back. Every ball into the box Derby landed on his head. 

Would have liked Killgallon though. He is the best centre back there is in the Championship and it is most likely we will get someone on loan (not Khiz) so we dont have championship quality dead weight in the premiership.</p>
