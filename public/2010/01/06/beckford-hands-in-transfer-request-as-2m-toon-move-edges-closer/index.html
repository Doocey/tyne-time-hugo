<h3 id="beckford-clearly-wants-a-move-this-january-transfer-window">Beckford - Clearly wants a move this January transfer window</h3>

<p>I think the next day or two will bring down the curtains on what has been a 2 year old love affair between Newcastle United and Jermaine Beckford. The Keegan, Kinnear, Shearer and now Hughton target has today handed a transfer request to the Elland Road hierarchy underlining his ambitions to leave Leeds United. After scoring the winner at Old Trafford amongst 19 other  goals this year, Chris Hughton is clearly in the hunt for the 6&rsquo;2 striker and I&rsquo;d expect a move to materialize within the next 48 hours. You needn&rsquo;t be an expert or have inside sources to figure that one out.</p>

<p>I know there&rsquo;s ¬†mixed opinions on Beckford but it looks as if, whether we like it or not, he&rsquo;ll be playing in a Black and White jersey very soon, and maybe as soon as our away trip to Reading.</p>

<p>Beckford, who worked with the RAC fitting windscreens not too long ago will be playing in front of 40,000 + spectators, any footballers dream. We certainly hope he takes his chance and leaves whatever bad attitude he has, back in Leeds.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt the lad can finish, but the Championship is another step up. There&rsquo;s only one way to see if he&rsquo;s ready for it.</p>

<p>On a side note, Sky Bet offering odds for Jermaine Beckford&rsquo;s next club and I think we&rsquo;re all pretty certain he&rsquo;ll be arriving at St.James&rsquo; if no Premier League teams arrive.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I aren&#39;t sure how tall Becks is but he&#39;s definitely not 6&#39;4&#34;. I&#39;ve met him and he was a little taller than me (I&#39;m 6ft) but not by that much. 

Factual accuracy aside, he plays infront of big enough crowds already, that&#39;s got nothing to do with his motives to leave. Like you or me, when offered three times the salary you&#39;re currently on, you change job. He isn&#39;t the kind of player that goes to a football club through passion, I assure you, but don&#39;t doubt you&#39;ll continue to romaticise this move regardless. 

I hope he does well for you. He&#39;s provided a lot of goals for Leeds and I hold no hard feelings towards him. TSS.</p>

I would not be surprised if Beckford did indeed put his request in on the 30th, the last 7 days have allowed for a cooling off period which serves both club and player. If it had been announced last week, I would doubt that he would have played against Manure.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the request was indeed put in earlier but only now it&#39;s been officially accepted. Either way, he&#39;s on the move and if bookies, media and &#39;sources&#39; are to be, believed then he&#39;ll be a Magpie within 48 hours.
Things are never that simple when it comes to transfers at Newcastle though!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Worth a punt I&#39;d say at ¬£2million. Going by Leeds fan&#39;s reactions he seems to be a player you either love or hate.

Big fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond comes to mind and I mean absolutely no disrespect to Leeds, my thinking is that he&#39;d be mixing with &#34;prem&#34; experienced players for 6 months with the potential of promotion to the prem next season, could work out as a good deal for him and his future. Amazing to think he&#39;s not been a professional footballer for long either but certainly not the finished article yet. 

I&#39;m more worried about any potential outgoings but there seems very little action in that direction so far, except for Geremi, so we may be ok.</p>

Then sell mike ashley to sunderland for an undisclosed fee, then give llambias job as ball boy so we can all donate our hot bovrils to his empty head</p>

I would prefer someone like Ricky Lambert or Nicky Maynard personally but Beckford is better than nowt. We need a striker who plays on the shoulder of their defenders who has pace and guess what Beckford does both. Shola, Carroll and Ranger are all the same, we need another striker like Lovenkrands but better, and maybe Beckford can be. He&#39;s got to be worth ¬£2m considering we payed ¬£17m for Michael Owen who only went to Real Madrid for ¬£8m.

At end of the day though, most of his goals have came against League1 teams or lower, apart from the Man Utd goal. Fair enough he played rather well in that game, but it was one game, what happens when he&#39;s playing a game and the TV camera&#39;s are off?, it&#39;s well known that he doesn&#39;t show up in the big games.

I don&#39;t see MO being the kind of manager to take that sort of a risk on a player when he can attract much better, and he can afford much better. And by the way, who is to say Birmingham won&#39;t cough up that much, it&#39;s well known they have money to spend, and have only just bid ¬£9m for Babel in the last 24 hours.</p>

Also why not try Jamie O&#39;Hara, i was listening to an interview with him on talk sport and he said if pompey could re-loan he would definitley look at the chance of joining newcastle, get him in loan with a possible transfer at the end if all goes well for him and the club , what do you&#39;s think ?</p>

I don&#39;t care who you are, no one who isn&#39;t on the wind up can say they are a bigger club than Newcastle, it&#39;s beyond pathetic.  Leeds United have a history which started about 1965 and ended about 10 years later, that&#39;s it that&#39;s their history, but I don&#39;t think that ultimately defines a clubs size history even though we have 5 more major trophies than them.  It&#39;s almost unquantifiable, but how can a club who have no history of good support compare themselves with one of the best and most loyally supported clubs on eartH??  Leeds United have NEVER averaged over 40,000 in one season in it&#39;s entire history, we have 33 times, and we will this season in the second tier.  I know some toon fans who are deluded who think we should be back in the CL in 5 years etc... but how HOW can you compare that mickey mouse club to us???  I fail to see how.  Sunderland are a much bigger club than Leeds let alone NUFC, it aint even an argument, and it&#39;s not actually possible to put an argument up for Leeds being a bigger club, they&#39;re nearer a Watford or Hull than a Newcastle United in my view.  Newcastle Championship average gate 44,000 Leeds when they went down 21,000.  No one notices Leeds, rugby city, big population, absolutely woeful support.  In fact in Britain as far as football is concerned, I think Leeds and Edinburgh, attendances/local population have to be the worst in Britain.  Leeds pmsl</p>

I don&#39;t know how he&#39;d do in Premiership, but I will say this, worse strikers than him have scored goals in that league.

I was born in Hunslet near Leeds, but when I was 19 the family moved to Ryton as my dad was in the RAF and wanted to move nearer to Boomer.  Football in Leeds has never been as big in Leeds as it is in Newcastle, but don&#39;t criticise the Loiners as you don&#39;t really know about NUFC till you live here, but Leeds certainly are a more succesful club in the last 50 years, but I have to concede football is more important in peoples lives in Newcastle you have always had more people willing and able to go to games, and you&#39;re more newsworthy nationally, or the papers certainly seem to think so!!

You cant attract Matthew Kilgallon (ex Leeds by the way) so instead you stoop to division 3 to get your answer! Things must be bad!

You all deserted your team when they needed you the most. Joke of a club, probably the biggest laughing stock in English Football... though you are known as the Cartoon army so this makes sense.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">&#34;Robert Snodgrass&#34; check newcastles history and count all the cups we have won then count yours lol. we piss all over u. plus get ur facts right coz we won most of our cups in the 50&#39;s and are u sure u wanna compair us to leeds in the past 15years lol. that will be from the years 1995 to now. ok lets do it. lets start with cups ( newcastle 1 / leeds 0 ) newcastle won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. now its longest time in the prem from 1995 - now ( newcastle 14 years / leeds 9 years ). now highest place finish in prem ( newcastle 2nd / leeds 3rd ). now its how many times in Europe ( newcastle 7 times / leeds 4 times i think maybe less.only thing u ever had to be fair was a semi final in the champs leage but after that it went downhill plus newcastle have been in the champs league 2 times compaired to your 1 lol. plus we helped u with ur fall as well coz we beat u to 4th spot in the prem after that season and u needed that 4th spot b&#39;coz u needed the champs leauge money. then u went in the red and down u go lol.... so leeds are on the road win league one yh lol. well newcastle are on the road to win the Championship and back to the prem we go lol. do u know why tho ? i&#39;ll tell ya &#34; coz newcastle are bigger than leeds lol &#34;. now shut it and suck on Peter Ridsdale balls coz that the only thrill u&#39;ll ever have lmao. oh and 1 more thing. i cant beleve that leeds are so poor that ur hoping that the world cup comes to england so u&#39;ll get a bigger stadium lol. the only reason why newcastle fans are hoping that the world cup comes to england is b&#39;coz we want to see football come back to its real home, not so we getta bigger stadium. leeds must be poor lol. now hurry up coz Peter Ridsdale is waiting 4 you lol.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I gave up reading that after the first scentance. The fact you regard &#34;the intertoto cup&#34; as anything special as well as your texaco cups, makes me laugh - for such a big club that you are. You also wasted that Champions League spot &#34;u nicked from us&#34; as you couldnt even qualify, thats what the small teams do, such as Shelborne and Everton. 

The only thing you can hold claim to is the fact you won the FA Cup more times. 3 times in the 50s, and you&#39;re telling me thats when you won all your trophies. What a small minded club you must be. We dominated the 70s. You dominated NOTHING. You also conviniently missed out the fact we were in the European Cup final and got robbed then by some cheating officials. So dont give me &#34;the only thing you can claim is SEMI FINAL of Champions League&#34;. In fact, yes, at least we qualified, unlike your massive club eh!

Football got big post war, and you haven&#39;t won a top division since. Congrats! Massive achievement! Were there even European Competions back pre war??!

Who is your biggest legend I ask? Alan Shearer, well he won nothing with you, and he is the ultimate legend??!!??!!!!!!

Now stop pretending and face facts. Have a think about it in the Sport Direct store.. oh thats @ St Jame&#39;s Park by the way.</p>

Alan Shearer might have not won anythin 4 us but he got us higher than u in them days n took us to 2nd 3rd and 4th and 2 fa cup finals and that what counts. did leeds come higher than 2nd in prem ? did leeds get anywhere near the fa cup final ? hell no. plus at leat we can beat spainish teams in europe like when we beat Barca 3-2. u couldnt even beat Valencia for ef sake plus u had it easy to get to the semi&#39;s anyways. lets just face it. newcastle have got a bigger/better history then u n we are doing better than u now. wow so u won 3 cups in the 70&#39;s newcastle done the same in the 50&#39;s. every dog has his day and newcastle have had more by winning 24 cups to leeds 12. dosent matter when, where or how cups are won ! they are still cups n we have got more than u. even if u start from 1919 ( when leeds utd started )we have still won more cups than u. it says it in the history that newcastle are better leeds so why fight the truth. thats just dumb man. plus we have beatern leeds more times than leeds beatin us. now take ur leeds wannabe big timers ass back to leeds official website n cry like a bitch coz in noway u&#39;ll ever be bigger than newcastle.
