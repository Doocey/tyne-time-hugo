				<p>###¬†Targets - Hughton is confident they&rsquo;ll arrive</p>

<p>According to surfacing reports and the many of them, Jermaine Beckford and Matthew Kilgallon will be signing for Newcastle United in the January transfer window. Both &lsquo;The Killer&rsquo; and Beckford have been lined with possible moves to Newcastle, since the start of 2009 but no move materialized for either of them. Kilgallon, as well as Beckford are in the final months of their  respective contracts and Chris Hughton is hoping to get a bargain on both of them. However, Newcastle&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have it all to themselves, it&rsquo;s also being reported that numerous other Premier League clubs are monitoring the pairs situations.</p>

<p>Speaking today, Hughton said :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúI&rsquo;m pretty confident that by the end of this window we&rsquo;ll have added to the quality of player we have here,‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWe are certainly looking to bring in the two or three faces that we feel we will need to go through the rest of the season and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Chris does indeed want to bring both of the lads to Newcastle and he&rsquo;s being backed by Mike Ashley financially on this one. Last year Llambias said that Hughton would be given necessary transfer funds to find some new players.</p>

<p>It certainly seems as if Marlon Harewood will not be returning to Newcastle following his loan stunt at the club. The striker does want to join again but according to rumours, Villa are demanding ¬£250,000 for his loan, on top of his near ¬£30,000 a week wages.</p>

<p>If we do manage to sign both of these players in the next few days then I&rsquo;m sure a lot of fans will be happy as it seems that the majority are well receptive of both Beckford &amp; Kilgallon arriving.</p>

<p>We might be surprised though, perhaps we won&rsquo;t get any transfers at all! Somehow I think that Chris isn&rsquo;t lying though.</p>

<p>Comments welcome &amp; A Happy New Year üôÇ</p>

Zurab can play central defense or right back and Kilgallon can play central defense and left back. And all 3 players apparently are dying to come to Tyneside - so that&#39;s good news too. Oh - and we need to tie up young Danny Simpson - whether now for a small fee - or for free in the summer. Would also like to see some young players brought in - to continue the youth policy started a couple of years ago. Ranger, Kadar, Krul and Vuckic are all stars of the future at Newcastle. Then we need another 8 game winning streak starting against Reading a week tomorrow. That would be a decent start to the new year for most Newcastle fans.

Now, now, no need to be peevish.

I will be delighted if we keep all our first teamers and if we also get Killgallon and Beckford, together with at least getting Simpson&#39;s loan extended, it will be the best transfer window for ages.  

I am getting greedy now, as I would really love us to sign an attacking wide right player to balance the team, and if Barton lives up to his reputation and supplies the energy and skill in the middle of the park, we will be well set up for the second half of the season to consolidate our top of the league position.

Happy New Year Doocey  (keep up the good work in 2010) and all fellow bloggers.  Lovely to hear from you again Ed, Happy New Year to you too.  Are you setting up your blog again anytime soon?</p>

Now, now, no need to be peevish.

I will be delighted if we keep all our first teamers and if we also get Killgallon and Beckford, together with at least getting Simpson&#39;s loan extended, it will be the best transfer window for ages.  

I am getting greedy now, as I would really love us to sign an attacking wide right player to balance the team, and if Barton lives up to his reputation and supplies the energy and skill in the middle of the park, we will be well set up for the second half of the season to consolidate our top of the league position.

Happy New Year Doocey  (keep up the good work in 2010) and all fellow bloggers.  Lovely to hear from you again Ed, Happy New Year to you too.  Are you setting up your blog again anytime soon?</p>

He has some of the worst ball distribution I have ever seen, and surely if he was premier standard Fergie would have recalled him whe he had no defenders!!!!!!! We should take a look at Jason Shackle a decent centre half, he is with wolves but on loan to Darlo, played with Norwich last season on Loan from wolves as part of an agreement when wolves bought him. Also does anyone think we could do with a bit more creativity in the middle of the park? I know we are doing ok but the game against Derby highlited our lack of Midfield creativity, we were long ball, up and under footy!!! Anyway, happy 2010 to all Toon fans, KEEP THE FAITH!!!!</p>
