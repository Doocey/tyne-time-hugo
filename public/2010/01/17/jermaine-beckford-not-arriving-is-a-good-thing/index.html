<h3 id="beckford-staying-at-leeds-until-the-end-of-the-season-to-help-promotion-bid">Beckford - Staying at Leeds until the end of the season to help promotion bid</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of disappointed Newcastle United fans out there today at the news Leeds United&rsquo;s Jermaine Beckford will remain at Leeds United and try aid their promotion charge. A two nil away loss to Exeter City yesterday I&rsquo;m sure played a certain part in his decision and there&rsquo;s no doubt Leeds do really need the the striker. I for one, didn&rsquo;t really get too excited about the proposed  arrival of Jermaine Beckford because I&rsquo;ve seen him play, and a know a bit about him, not all too complimentary. There&rsquo;s no doubt the lad has talent and could probably cut it in the Championship, but I wouldn&rsquo;t bring him to the Premier League.</p>

<p>He today withdrew his transfer request and whether he actually had the chance to join Newcastle really is unknown. According to reports all three of our bids were rejected by the Elland Road outfit, and there wasn&rsquo;t many signs of other teams looking for his services.</p>

<p>Credit to Simon Grayson for keeping the striker at Leeds until the end of the season but if I was him, then I would&rsquo;ve certainly let him go for anywhere on the ¬£2m mark. Jermaine will more than likely walk in the summer for free unless Leeds can convince him to sign a new contract.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you all have different opinions but I&rsquo;m quite satisfied that the 26 year-old hasn&rsquo;t arrived on Tyneside. He has a past of controversial incidents and we really don&rsquo;t need them kind of players at Newcastle. Now I&rsquo;m sure he would&rsquo;ve been alright at Newcastle but we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>

<p>The thing is now, who&rsquo;s next for Chris Hughton? I wouldn&rsquo;t bank on us signing any new faces permanently this January, and we will more than likely see Marlon Harewood come back to St.James&rsquo; Park on loan until the summer. I can&rsquo;t wait üòÄ</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I know all football supporters tend to be the same, i.e A player is captured from another club against their wishes = coup. A player turns down the chance to move to their club = he&#39;s crap/wouldn&#39;t have cut the mustard/glad he never came, I never rated him, type attitude. However all the reports/comments I saw coming out from you Geordies was at a ¬£1.5/¬£2m punt he was worth it!!! Suddenly your relieved he hasn&#39;t come! LOL
Don&#39;t get me wrong it baffled me why you wanted him in the first place bearing in mind your position in the CCC. However delving deeper I can see it was an act of desperation by CH in trying to keep your season on track. You could be in for a sticky time of it in the 2nd half of the campaign! To hope a player that you already had on loan will come back to spearhead the attack is the act of a club decidedly on a wobble. Our two clubs mirror each other a division apart-failure to move up would be disaterous for either. I have doubts myself that Beckford could do the business at CCC level consistently, (he&#39;s shown he can have a nose for goal on the big stage-but has only managed it the once), but at L1 level he can hack it. Half a season in CCC, well it might&#39;ve been the difference in getting you up, before defences found him out. 
Sounds as if both clubs supporters have got what they want out of the Beckford situation then eh?
Best of luck to you as the PL needs big clubs back in there before it becomes a joke of a league with only 5 or 7 teams with history/fanbase in there!</p>

Not in the Premier League but 500k is often a transfer on it&#39;s own.

For Newcastle though, it really shouldn&#39;t mean too much, but whether it&#39;s been the difference between us signing anyone and not, I really don&#39;t know.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">In fairness, not defending DikieBoy, but a deal between ¬£1.5m and ¬£2m is actually quite substantial.
Not in the Premier League but 500k is often a transfer on it&#39;s own.

For Newcastle though, it really shouldn&#39;t mean too much, but whether it&#39;s been the difference between us signing anyone and not, I really don&#39;t know.</p>

Another place to look is Scotland.Celtic seem to be having a lot of problems keeping players(with the mass exodus in the last few days!)players such as Mcgeady,Hinkel and Crosas would be quality additions to our squad.rangers two most promising youngsters John Fleck and Danny Wilson have both rejected new contracts,and look likely to leave.These would be quality additions!

I also agree with your comments about looking towards the yuongsters in Scotland, and the tp players there, However I don&#39;t think McGeady etc would join us, infact as soon as word came out that we made a bid for him, a Premiership club would steal him away from Celtic first.

Having trouble with a player wanting to leave ?
The answer?
Inform him Newcatsle United are willing to enrole in transfer talks.
Result= The player will take him self off the transfer list and continue to play for your club.

See, Kilgallon &amp;amp; Beckford.

Tomorrow hopefully will not show the cracks that have appeared over the last few weeks.

Come on the Toon, i feel tomorrows game could be win or bust. (yeah sounds dramatic, but the WBA result could be the start of something very good or something very bad)</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I agree with this article, he wouldnt cut it in the PL. As a Leeds fan, his laziness, fits of arogance and mood swings do my head in...but I forget all about that when he bangs them in! He has a fantastic record and can never be written off no matter how poor a game he seems to be having. He is ACE!!!</p>

Honestly, I&#39;m not even sure he would score many in the Championship, never mind the Premiership should you get promoted. That goal against our friends from across the Pennines epitomised the guy. A complete mis-control accounted for by sheer pace. Now that may get you the odd goal, but not the kind of return a newly-promoted club will need in the Prem. Here&#39;s to our teams playing each other soon, in the right bloody division!!</p>

I think he would of been a good signing because as an impact player in the premier he would no doubt be dangerous. Beckford 2 mill out Going up 10 mill&#43;, we are Leeds!</p>
