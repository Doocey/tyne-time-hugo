<p>The speculation goes on. Just as it seemed Jermaine Beckford was joining Newcastle United this January, the tale has taken another twist. It&rsquo;s now reported that Sunderland and Wolves have both joined the race to sign the FA Cup hero as Leeds United stall over Newcastle&rsquo;s latest bid. Sources suggested that Newcastle&rsquo;s latest bid was indeed rejected but no one knows for  sure. Apparently The Elland Road outfit are holding out for ¬£2m for Beckford but most of the teams know that his contract expires in only a few months time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt we need to strengthen this January and a striker is probably necessary. Harewood has been offered back to Newcastle on a permanent basis if reports are to believed and this is to prise our attentions away from Jermaine Beckford, or so they say.</p>

<p>Simon Grayson said :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;As a footballer, you can only leave when your contract expires or you are given permission to go.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve said all along that while he&rsquo;s under contract, we&rsquo;ll dictate when he leaves the football club. That&rsquo;s why you sign contracts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Putting in a transfer request doesn&rsquo;t guarantee he&rsquo;ll get a move. Until someone meets our valuation, he&rsquo;ll stay here.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&rsquo;t help but get the feeling Beckford is a troublemaker and could disrupt the harmony at Newcastle at the minute. As well as this we aren&rsquo;t really sure if he would cut it in the Championship. What happens when/if we get promoted? Will Beckford remain on the books at the Toon? I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also understood that Mike Ashley won&rsquo;t shell out ¬£2m for the striker who can be snapped up on a free, in a few months time. However, that&rsquo;s not a footballing brain thinking, he&rsquo;s just keen on keeping his pennies close to his purse.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can do better than Beckford, Giles Barnes although not a striker is a <strong>free</strong> transfer at this minute. Remember, it wasn&rsquo;t long ago we nearly shelled out <em>¬£5m</em> for the Derby County winger. He&rsquo;s certainly worth a shot, being a free-agent and only 21 years of age.</p>

<p>Developments are expected to come within the next few days over our potential targets, we&rsquo;ll just have to sit tight and hope for the best.</p>

Simple isn`t it. 

You are correct in thinking Beckford is a trouble maker.

Poor attitude, sulks and massive ego on very limited talent.

He refuses to jump for headers, will not run for a ball unless its within 5 yards.

Seriously i would say its a gamble paying 1/2 Mill.</p>

Beckford himself has said barely anything publicly in all the time he&#39;s been at Leeds, as far as I recall has had one publicly stroppy moment and has a fantastic goalscoring record.  He also ran more than five yards for the Man U goal (and most of his others).  As for him having a massive ego - not unknown to footballers is it?  And so what if he has?  self-belief is important in fottball.  Whether he would make it in the premier league I don&#39;t know but I am pretty certain he&#39;s more than good enough for the championship.

¬£2million for a player out of contract in June, little championship experience &amp;amp; no premier league experience- are Leeds having a laugh?

FFS.  Have you had your head up yer arse for the last year?

Leeds don&#39;t wan&#39;t to sell.  Leeds don&#39;t need to sell.  Time and time again SG has said that only a silly offer will sufice.  It&#39;s the same old vultures trying to grab a bargain that are having a laugh.  Only this time the seller ain&#39;t desperate.</p>

Bear in mind when talking about the fee that you&#39;ve to add an additional mill for Beckford. He would get it as a free contract player in June so believe me, it will be a condition of him signing for a club now. 

To my mind it would pay Beckford to wait till June to see which of his suitors are in the Prem next season.</p>

Or why he went on loan to Fulham and didn&#39;t get a game?  Derby County are the worst team to play at SJP this season and they released him.  Switch on fella, your embarrassing yourself.  The guy is one injury away from retirement.</p>

And before anyone starts sayin he wont cut it, he has a better touch than shola, better finisher than shola and more pace, and shola has scored his fair share in this league. Even if we paid 2mil for him now just to get us promoted, he may not cut it in the prem but we can soon sell him on and get our money back</p>

&#39;&#39;he looses his head easily if he misses an early chance and sometimes he tries something he shouldnt when a simpler touch would produce a goal. if beckford goes we have been linked with players HOOPER.MCLEAN and others who have abetter goal ratio than beckford it makes you wonderwhy a team picks a player and why aren,t newcastle looking at these players ??&#39;&#39;

I&#39;ll tell you why Les, NUFC always get carried away by a name rather than a player. Look at Owen, the guy was finished when he left Liverpool imo. Has Capello for example, ever been remotely bothered? Yet he comes to newcastle for ¬£17M or something in 2005 just to get injured. Look at the situation now, half the geordie public are calling for us to sign Jermaine Beckford, based on 20 LEAGUE ONE goals and a goal against a patched up Man U defense. The same Man U that struggled to get a 1-1 draw against birmingham the other day. The guy is available on a FREE in the summer, on top of that apparently his attitude stinks and he spurns most his chances. Sounds like he would be well out his depth in the premier league, yet ppl will still get p off with Ashley when he doesnt pay rediculously over the odds for him. If Villa and Sunderland are interested in signing him, why hasnt he gone to any of these clubs? ¬£2M is nothing to a prem team. Coz its utter rubbish thats why.
There are so many better PROVEN forwards we could go for, Boyd, mcdonald, sharp, hooper, ect all these players are proven, some internationals, at a higher level than beckford and most are  down to earth and would probably give their right arm to sign for newcastle. We have to stop looking at the Names signings and start making some intelligent signings.</p>

DJG, you must not watch much League 1 football mate. Its not just 20 goals in League 1, its the fact he has notched 64 goals in 93 starts, has pace to burn and is the most prolific goal scorer in England today, FACT. You might say Man U are a poor team but they are a damn sight better than the likes of Scunthorpe, Peterborough etc who we need him to score against. ¬£2m is gamble worth making to get us out of the Championship, if he doesn&#39;t score in the PL sell him back to a Champoinship club at a profit!  He does huff sometimes after being subbed but he&#39;s a model pro off the pitch.  After handing in a transfer request last season, he still got his head down and notched another 20 odd goals.  As for Sharp and Hooper, your having a laugh mate, Beckford is twice the striker.  If Beckford doesn&#39;t score in the PL Sharp and Hooper have no chance.  Boyd and McDonald WOULD be a suitable plan B, although I doubt we could get either for 2m.  You are saying we need to make intelligent, proven signings.  What more does Beckford have to do??</p>
