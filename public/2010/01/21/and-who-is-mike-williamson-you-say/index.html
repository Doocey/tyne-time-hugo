<h3 id="williamson-bid-accepted">Williamson - Bid accepted</h3>

<p>It seems Chris Hughton is moving fairly rapidly on transfers at the minute and for once it seems as if we could complete two transfers in the space of two days, for two defenders. The arrival of Danny Simpson was confirmed yesterday and Sky Sports revealed tonight that Mike Williamson will enter talks with Newcastle United following our bid was accepted for the 6&rsquo;4 defender. Mike  Williamson arrived at Fratton Park for a initial fee of ¬£2m, a transfer fee that could&rsquo;ve rose to ¬£5m if he had played a certain amount of games for the club. However, with Portsmouth financially strapped, they&rsquo;re pretty much eager to accept any bid, and it get rid of that clause on their part anyway.</p>

<p>A lot of fans never heard of this guy, but I must say I remember the day that Portsmouth signed him. I was watching the Transfer Deadline Day and waiting for news of Michael Johnson&rsquo;s possible move to Newcastle. The only thing I can remember besides Johnson failing to arrive was what seemed a huge fee for Portsmouth to pay for a Watford defender. He&rsquo;s 26 years of age.</p>

<p>Needless to say we haven&rsquo;t seen anything of him of late and he&rsquo;s looking for the exit door, as quick as possible. What we don&rsquo;t know is if the bid that&rsquo;s been accepted is a loan deal or includes a transfer fee. Most fans are saying it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that there&rsquo;s a fee involved in this transfer.</p>

Netherless we were also after him at the same time as portsmouth but of course MA wasnt forthcoming with funds and we lost out all i can say any player coming in is better than none as the squad as a whole is still thin compared to many and should we get promotion which i guess we will, can you really see us buying big in the future. the simpson williamson? and a couple of other signings wages will be paid by the geremi sale to turkey on his 58k a week wages so the wage bill will not increase and for 3 or 4 new faces is a good bit of business for hughton</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I guess portsmouth in there current financial state are just glad to get rid of another wage of the bill at least we can aybe pay him on time. Netherless we were also after him at the same time as portsmouth but of course MA wasnt forthcoming with funds and we lost out all i can say any player coming in is better than none as the squad as a whole is still thin compared to many and should we get promotion which i guess we will, can you really see us buying big in the future. the simpson williamson? and a couple of other signings wages will be paid by the geremi sale to turkey on his 58k a week wages so the wage bill will not increase and for 3 or 4 new faces is a good bit of business for hughton</p>

this guy hardly got games, but with talent around him it might bring out the best in him.
at least were not selling players.
even though were in a lower div (for now) our squad is still head &amp;amp; shoulders above portsmouths.
no money...no morale...no confidence.

Not sure if he was at Wycombe when Steven Taylor was there, but Williamson blossomed under Tony Adams and moved to Watford.

Not seen much of him at Watford, but do remember the Watford side he was in played good football and regularly challenged the CCC league. My mate is a Watford fan and remember last year asking about him when we were linked and he told me he was very decent and one of the better CCC defenders, didnt want to lose him.

Willo will be great cover for Taylor and Collo and could be used against large strong forwards for his aerial ability.

A great signing if this happens, all we need now is another RB, a forward with pace and power and a midfielder to replace Butt and we will be sorted.</p>
