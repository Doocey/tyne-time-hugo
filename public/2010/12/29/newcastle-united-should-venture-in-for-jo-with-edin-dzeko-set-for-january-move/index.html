<p>#### Jô - Would be an extremely good addition to Newcastle United this January</p>

<p>It is very likely that Edin Džeko will join Manchester City this January in a €35m move come January as VfL Wolfsburg have lowered their asking initial asking price. Another ridiculous fee to pay for a striker who I can only guess would be delighted to join the club for its wages. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Edin is a fine talent and will score a lot of goals given the chance, but he isn&rsquo;t worth any  more than £17m in all honesty. However, we needn&rsquo;t worry about all this commotion because surprisingly, it could spell some good news for Newcastle United as a club.</p>

<p>Firstly the arrival of Džeko will hopefully and more than likely end Manchester City&rsquo;s interest in our prized asset Andy Carroll. Mancini no doubt carried some interest in the commanding CF and it&rsquo;s more than known that if City had indeed failed with their final bid of around €35m for Džeko, then Andy Carroll was next on their list.</p>

<p>Secondly, the arrival of yet another striker means that the likes of &lsquo;fringe&rsquo; players such as Emmanuel Adebayor, Craig Bellamy, Roque Santa Cruz, Felipe Caicedo and indeed Jô. In all fairness, I think any of those strikers would come very close to definite starters up front for any other team in the Premier League. Adebayor cost somewhere in the region of £25m, Jô around £18m, Santa Cruz £16m + and Bellamy a meagre £11m.</p>

<p>This is a just a slight example of how Manchester City have shamed the world of football by splashing out needless millions on overrated players, and I haven&rsquo;t even began to mention any midfielders, defenders, keepers, with many more of them primed for an exit at Eastlands.</p>

<p>With that all said and done, one of the available players this January must surely be the Brazilian Jô. The 23 year-old striker arrived for nothing short of £18m and has played nothing short of 18 games for the club. £1m a game - seems a good deal indeed, mind you he has even scored a goal or two as icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Now why on earth do i think he would be a good addition to Newcastle United? There are many reasons, and to sum it up - he hasn&rsquo;t showed his real potential at Manchester City, or rather has not been given a chance to do so.</p>

<p>The lad can finish, and can head the ball well as you would expect for someone over 6 ft tall. On loan at Everton last season, he showed what he could do and grabbed something in the region of 5 goals for the club in a small amount of appearances.</p>

<p>Alongside Andy Carroll it could well be a lethal combination, and as much as I know we need someone pacy, light and that can finish Jô could compliment Carroll quite well. I cannot speak for the lad himself or tell you exactly how good he would be on Tyneside but I would be more than willing to give him a chance, and I&rsquo;d be confident he would bang a few goals in.</p>

<p>I think he would leave for NUFC, on loan anyway. His realistic value now is about £5 or £6m but I wouldn&rsquo;t splash that out on him. If we could get him on loan with an option to buy at the end of the season if we wanted to, for £5m then I think it could work out quite well. Just like the Ben Arfa deal, but not committing too much too soon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll probably never happen, but if I was manager I would certainly make an enquiry for him, and maybe even a loan move for Shaun Wright-Phillips too.</p>

<p>Feel free to voice who you think Newcastle United should sign this January, if we manage to sign anyone at all!</p>

Caiceido and Jo would not walk into other premiership teams
Santa Cruz cannot even walk
If you cannot afford players don&#39;t expect handouts, leave the premiership to Sunderland 
Why are City stupid enough to loan you a player, if he is crap you send him back, if he is good you get a bargain?  Get real!
The reason City spend so much is because clubs ask unrealistic prices so that is the reason, greedy clubs like Newcastle trying to cash in because of City&#39;s money
Losing millions on players is no big deal, it is small change to Sheikh Mansour
However, we won&#39;t waste it on the likes of potential such as Andy Carroll who is not even an England regular
You are what City used to be, a laughing stock with fans like you who know nothing about football or have a clue what is going on at Eastlands

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">To be fair, I&#39;m not bitter towards Manchester City at all, just pointing out their extravagant spending, which has been needless, wasteful and outright disgraceful.

We have wasted money in our years yes, but those days are gone, and it was nothing to the extent of the current City setup. Why buy a player for £18m and don&#39;t give the lad a chance? Or Adebayor for £25m and he isn&#39;t given a kick.

There&#39;s no defending the ruthless and pointless spending of Manchester City, simple as.
However, if you had read the article, which I hope you had, you would see that I&#39;m talking about Jo coming to Newcastle United, not dedicating the whole article to City&#39;s financial expenditure.

One final thing, anything I have happened to mention about City, pretty much all fact eh?</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">No mate, it&#39;s not fact. Stating we have &#34;shamed&#34; the world of football is an opinion. Look at it like this. Did you lot flinch from spending big on players and wages (relative to the time) when you were regularly up at the top of the table. A time, incidentally, when we were plowing the furrow of lower league football. No-one cared about leading prem clubs paying big money then. What is happening at City is the culmination of the commercialisation of the Premier League, of which NUFC has been an integral part from day one.

Jo not had a chance? Do you bother to do any research at all? He&#39;s been in and around the squad all season. Hughes fucked him off to scouse2 and Galatasaray because he was a complete waster when he first arrived - examples include going out on the piss when he had missed training due to a &#34;sore throat&#34;.

As for wasting money - we are level on points with the league leaders. Some waste that is.</p>

I used to admire Man City and always thought of them as a similar club to NUFC (badly run, sleeping giant with a working class fan base), but they have turned into another club that everyone despises because of the money the new owners have thrown at it. NUFC has it&#39;s problems, but I hope we never get a super rich owner where money is no object as it just sucks the heart and soul out of the club and doesn&#39;t always produce results as was proven with Michael Owen and the numerous other duds that were bought by our last bank-loan happy director. While I&#39;m here, if you divide England in South, Middle and North, Manchester in in the Middle, not the North!</p>

Don&#39;t really want to dignify your diatribe with a debate but you&#39;re forgetting one thing....all the surplus players you&#39;ve mentioned were not signed by Mancini. How many managers have wanted to sign their own players and build their own team? I don&#39;t think i need to remind you what Kevin &#34;the Messiah&#34; Keegan did at your club not that long ago do i? Jog your memory!? er... bought a lot of his own players at great expense to try to bring success to NUFC. Pot &amp;amp; Kettle again perhaps? Mmmmm, now will you shut up? CTID!!!!</p>

so before you start calling my club ,think,i would rather have our boy and all his riches than that idiot you have got,jesus  chris hughton did not deserve him,and as for sucking the heart and soul out of our club, as a season ticket holder for many years,i can tell you the feeling and atmosphere at the ground has never been as good.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Digging? Is that what you call my observations on the goings on at Manchester City?
I&#39;m not the only one of this opinion, and there&#39;s a reason for it.
All of you City fans are willing to defend the outrageous spending? £290,000 a week on Yaya Torres, £286,000 on Tevez, millions &lt;strong&gt;wasted&lt;/strong&gt;, and there&#39;s no debating that.

Spending millions will only bring you so far, you need a team spirit to achieve trophies, and I&#39;m not talking about Newcastle United, but the likes of Manchester United&#39;s, Tottenham&#39;s etc.

Throwing millions at players won&#39;t win you the league either, and as &#39;on top of the table&#39; we&#39;ll see what the scenario is come the end of the season shall we?
As for Keegan, sure he did, but did he use most of the players he brought in? I think so. 
Did we nearly win the league two years in a row? Looks like we did.
We didn&#39;t splash anywhere in the region of Manchester City though, and as for the poster about Alan Shearer and £17m and all that, Shearer was a legend, one of England&#39;s greatest ever strikers - and certainly justified his £17m price tag.
We didn&#39;t win the league no, as you know, The Red Side Of Manchester snatched it.

&lt;strong&gt;Antoniosmithio&lt;/strong&gt; sums it up perfectly. I&#39;d much rather to avoid rich owners, even though I know many Toon fans would love huge investment in foreign talents.
Do we really want a club with a bunch of players solely there for the money?

Anyway, agree to disagree then.
Good luck to both of us for the remainder of the season.</p>
