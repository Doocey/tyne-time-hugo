<p>####¬†Carroll - Wants to come home and his return is a a real possibility</p>

<p>Some things are just perfect. Selling a guy to Liverpool for ¬£35m after only playing three-quarters of a Premier League season, and then finishing above them in the league with their new signing having very little impact, is probably as close as perfect can get when it comes to football. The cherry on top of it all sees Newcastle United coming back in for Carroll in a cut price deal and the player himself, refusing to talk to any other club other than his homeland team. Liverpool: stuck in a rut, much?</p>

<p>The manager who signed Andy in the first place has since been  sacked and replaced by a coach who loves to pass the ball around, and have his team play a very fluid type of football. Inevitably, Andy won&rsquo;t see much playing time in this new system, and Brendan Rodgers has already admitted that he is open to the possibility of the ¬£35m man leaving Anfield.</p>

<p>West Ham were linked, but the man in question didn&rsquo;t want a move to Big Sam&rsquo;s side, and can you blame him? It really would be a fall from grace after signing for a record fee, only to find yourself playing with a newly promoted side a year later, that could well go right back down to the Championship again.</p>

<p>If ever a transfer move was written in the scripts - it&rsquo;s Andy Carroll returning to Newcastle United and finding his form again, form that caught Kenny Dalglish&rsquo;s eye enough to splash out seven times what Barcelona parted with for a certain Diego Maradona many years ago.</p>

<p>A loan move had been suggested by NUFC but Liverpool quickly refused any such offer, however they did indicate that a permanent deal could still be arranged. The much talked about potential fee is expected to be in the region of ¬£17m.</p>

<p>A little bit steep for a guy who far from impressed at Anfield to put it mildly.</p>

<p>Realistically, I would be looking to secure a deal of around ¬£13m <del>+ Xisco</del>. We can offer cash up front, so no installments over 48 months or performance related add-ons. What we&rsquo;ll offer is what you&rsquo;ll get - straight into the bank account ready for spending.</p>

<p>If West Ham were to loan him, finances would be something of a delicate matter and I&rsquo;m sure Liverpool would just like to get rid and move on as quickly as they can.</p>

<p>Personally, I would love to see Andy back at St.James&rsquo; Park pulling on the Black and White stripes. He&rsquo;s still a Geordie, and has a lot to offer. You don&rsquo;t turn into a poor footballer in a few months - Andy just needs proper service and a bit of encouragement, something that he most certainly did not get at Liverpool.</p>

<p>¬£17m is a tad high for my liking and with Mike Ashley officially in charge of the deal, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll dish out that type of cash for him. A maximum fee of ¬£14m could sway the deal and before the start of the Premier League campaign, we could well have Big Andy back on Tyneside after a remarkable 12 months for all parties concerned.</p>

<p>The time has come to bring Andy home, but for the right fee, and for the right wages. He won&rsquo;t be given ¬£75,000 a week at NUFC, probably half that but somehow I don&rsquo;t think Carroll will get too caught up on the aspect of wages; he just wants a return home, and fast.</p>

<p>Do what&rsquo;s right Liverpool - let the lad leave for a reasonable fee and move on.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Fine ¬†- keep him - newcastle are under no pressure to buy , we have enough strikers, he wont go to west ham or fulham so now what? - let him rot in liverpool reserves because he refuses to move anywhere else but newcastle? I have heard people saying newcastle might already of had a 25% sell on clause for andy on top of the 35 mill liverpool paid - so if you sell him back to us lol - take off 25% which would make the 20million some are quoting - 15 mill.

Not fussed either way if he gets a move back tbh but pointless saying you dont want a player(rodgers) ¬†and then refusing to sell him for less than 20 million - the ball isnt in liverpools court any more and andy doesnt need to move - he could happily sit and take his wages for the next 4 years @ 75000 a week - good luck with that lol</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Newcastle can go whistle if they think Liverpool will sell for less than 20m. He&#39;s a big reason why we finished so low in the league. He missed plenty of chances and didn&#39;t have the speed of thought or the physical speed to get into positions when Suarez had turned defenders inside out. On his day, like the FA Cup final, he can be immense and that is the player worth 35m. But Liverpool won&#39;t be taken for mugs again and a deal will probably involve Ba if Newcastle don&#39;t offer up enough cash. </p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">It is great that Newcastle has enough strikers. Still, if they are not willing to pay the asking price, then leave him alone. The fans should stop dreaming about his return and the club should stop instigating their so-called &#34;legends&#34; to talk up Carroll and openly hope for their return. 
On the other hand, I doubt Carroll will jump at the chance to move. Not when your beloved chairman Ashley pushed him out of the club and claimed he left for &#34;monetary reasons&#34; One thing¬†Ashley got right was, it was for monetary reasons, his.</p>

Past trophies¬†are not a measure of current performance, nor¬†are they¬†a measure of current transfer kitty. West ham do not have the current finances to pay more than 15m for a striker.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Yep you have won more than us however all your glory supporters will soon be supporting City or Chelsea. Toon supporters support their local team without the need of glory to keep them going as their love for their club is enough. Maybe you scousers are scared just how big a club NUFC would be if we had 20k plus glory supporters on top of our loyal fan base. Let&#39;s face it you were mugged with AC and you all know it that&#39;s why all you scousers are winging like mad. When we buy him back for 12m the whole of the football world will be pissing their pants at LFC. Times are indded changing losers!!!!!!!!!</p>

We got a bargain when you look at the quality of the players brought in with that money. AC has had a pretty poor first season for a ¬£35m striker so if we get him for ¬£14m then add the price of the players we&#39;ve bought with the ¬£35m we&#39;d still have ¬£7m-ish left!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Newcastle already made a derisory bid for Andy Carroll before, and it was ignored. Liverpool will not sell him for less than they can afford to so whatever that price is, we will take the isolated financial loss, trade it against the inflated price we received for Torres and move on really no worse off, (other than having lost Torres).

What makes me laugh is Newcastle and their supporters (the writer of this article being a perfect example) smugly believe this is great for them (like it&#39;s some great victory to buy him back for less that he was sold?) but they are courting a player who has been deemed a failure (so far) at one of the biggest clubs in the country? Good, perhaps he has not yet found his level and I don&#39;t think currently his quality matches Liverpools ambition yet regardless of value, so its interesting that you want him back at all, especially if you harbour great ambition (at least of competing at the top of the table).

If your club insist on making derisory offers for him Liverpool should keep Carroll (they don&#39;t need the money nor do they need to sell him), and¬†simply offer Newcastle ¬£7 millions for Ba, and trigger his release clause, because whilst you want Carroll back so much (probably for the wrong reasons), what you should really concentrate on is re-newing Ba&#39;s contract before you lose him to one of the many &#39;bigger&#39; clubs in this league.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">JJ,

First off, you seem to be labouring under the assumption that we desperately want Andy back, which isn&#39;t true at all. We&#39;ve placed a speculative bid on him because your new manager has hinted that there&#39;s no place for Andy in his starting 11. We don&#39;t need Andy in our team, we already have two strikers who would walk into Liverpool&#39;s team.

Secondly, it&#39;s not our fault that Liverpool wasted so much money on AC, you only have yourselves to blame. We didn&#39;t want to sell him at all until you offered silly money for him. If you want to sell him you&#39;re going to have to accept that you&#39;re not going to get anywhere near what you paid for him. He scored four league goals last season. ¬£13.5 million is generous and if you don&#39;t like it then enjoy another another four years of Andy bleeding your club dry because we&#39;re not as keen to sign him as you are keen to cut your losses. We&#39;re going to dictate the terms of any sale.

And as for the ambitious &#34;big club&#34; jibe, how far above you did we finish last season? How many world class players are lining up to play for Liverpool? You took two of our most promising players (Andy and Jos√©) and ruined them in one year. You can harp on about history and cups as much as you want, I&#39;ll enjoy comparing Ciss√©&#39;s goal stats to Carroll&#39;s this season.</p>

So if Newcastle can get him for ¬£17m, they should do so before somebody else does.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">erm no, LFC are not debt-free. LFC owe FSG&#39;s UKSV company around ¬£30m. Its an interest-free loan. The accounts for the year ending July 2011 makes that clear. You&#39;ll find articles by the likes of the Guardian that comment on it, published around in May (loads of articles were published around May on it as that is when the accounts became public, as that is when we fully knew how bloody expensive the homework on the potential stadium was, as it was given in the accounts). The same article by the Guardian, state the accounts also make clear there is a ¬£120m borrowing facility with RBS, Bank of America and Barclays. Even the independent reputable finance football expert Swiss Ramble comments on this. These were stated on Liverpool&#39;s accounts, not FSG&#39;s or UKSV&#39;s, therefore Liverpool have a loan and Liverpool have a borrowing facility. If you understand the accounts, you will see that for yourself, the FACTS. If not, the several articles around at May make it clear for you anyway, the FACTS. The FACTS are that Liverpool owe UKSV money as well as setting up a facility. Read those articles at least, if you still can not accept we are not debt-free, than you are a lost cause who will continue to¬†humiliate¬†yourself when you shout we are debt-free...as we are not!


We are in a better position than we were under H&amp;amp;G but puh-leez don&#39;t make we are debt-free when the OFFICIAL CLUB ACCOUNTS CLEARLY DISAGREE WITH YOU.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Andy,¬†

I&#39;m not labouring under any assumption, I made no inference in my post about what level your desire to sign Carroll was, &#39;desperate&#39; or otherwise, ¬†you have made an offer you do want to buy him, and I believe your reasons are misguided (at least judging by the comments and the post of Newcastle fans), because as you rightly point you have two strikers who have one good premier league season under their belts they certainly wouldn&#39;t &#39;walk&#39; into Liverpool sides but they have some promise, and your style of play has also improved.

I am simply replying to a post (of which there are many) written by another Newcastle supporter who would (and I quote directly from the article) &#34;
Personally, I would love to see Andy back at St.James‚Äô Park&#34;¬†¬†so your first point has no context.

Also no one said it was Newcastles fault that Liverpool bought AC so again not sure why you make this point. We didn&#39;t want to sell Torres either, but we also got silly money for him, I&#39;d say both clubs overpaid by about 20 million, Liverpool probably even maybe a little more and Torres hardly set the world alight at Chelsea, but unlike Carroll at least he is a proven world class player, and I believe still is but that&#39;s water under the bridge, he left.

Furthermore I think you have a poor grasp of the economics of Liverpool FC if you believe a player on the salary of Carroll will &#34;bleed the club dry&#34; of course it won&#39;t that&#39;s absurd. There is no need to cut any losses, we have wealthy owners and a debt free club with huge global support, we won&#39;t fold under his weekly wages, you make an erroneous point all decision re players Liverpool make are based first on football, then finances second.

Also once again, I did not say one thing about history or cups, so not sure why are bringing it up (chip on the shoulder perhaps). ¬†

I know Liverpool&#39;s past, and Arsenals and Man Utds&#39; and they aren&#39;t relevant. You did finish higher this year, I honestly can&#39;t remember how many times that has happened in the last 30&#43; years, but last season is also history is it not? and ironically the only person bringing that up is you, not me.

Jose and AC, these players are not ruined, they are being scrutinised under a higher expectation at Liverpool than before (undeniable fact I&#39;m afraid), and Jose had a great 3/4 of the season till he tired towards the end because having reached two cup finals he played far more games than was previously required of him at Newcastle, as for Carroll, he showed his lack of versatility in a different formation to the old Newcastle style he broke through in, and under the weight of a ludicrous fee.

Finally, realistically anyone can see it&#39;s not a a jibe to say there are bigger clubs than Newcastle in this league to argue there aren&#39;t is foolish. it&#39;s difficult to gauge size, so let just go on ¬†revenue ¬†for the sake of argument (we&#39;ll forget history and success shall we.) generated through a combination of success, and support.

This will do for starters(see below) - 6 teams (probably Villa as well) so about 1/3rd of the Premier league, as I said concentrate on the good players you did sign, that got you to that finish in the table because these &#39;bigger&#39; clubs will come in for them at some point if they keep showing that form.

I will also look forward to next season, Ladbrokes don;t often get it wrong do they?
Manchester City	¬†5/4,¬†Manchester Utd	9/4,¬†Chelsea¬†9/2,¬†Arsenal¬†12/1,¬†Tottenham¬†20/1,¬†Liverpool¬†25/1,¬†Newcastle¬†150/1
Good luck...

__

Let&#39;s be honest here. If Liverpool went back in for Fernando Torres for say ¬£20m, and he wanted a move back to Anfield (which he clearly doesn&#39;t) I think it&#39;s fair to say Anfield would be extremely excited about the possibility of his return for a cut-price. We didn&#39;t want to sell Andy but our hand was forced, and now after robbing our leading striker that year - we are offering you lot the opportunity to get over ¬£12m back in cash and move on. No other clubs are offering a lump of money at the minute, and Andy doesn&#39;t want a move anywhere but St.James&#39; - we&#39;re helping you out in one way.Carroll had 11 goals to his name by January in a newly promoted side, and was the most feared forward aerially, in the Premier League at that time.You made him the &#39;failure&#39; he is at the minute - we&#39;ll get his form back with some proper service, a proper manager and some proper support.

It&#39;s best for all parties if he comes back to Tyneside and we both move on with our seasons. You&#39;ll have bagged millions and will make room for another forward of Rodgers choice. Straight forward. Either that, or you keep paying him ¬£75,000 a week with little return, and all that time his potential transfer value reduces to single figures.¬†

Your call Liverpool.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Sounds all familiar this, were you hyping up the arrival of KK in the same manner you are hyping up Rodgers? People making out Rodgers to be some messiah, hold your tongue and show some restraint, before coming out with some nauseating arrogant hype as we could easily be in the same position we were with KK in the league last season. We haven&#39;t won the league in two decades and were embarassing last season in the league, I would have thought at least some fans would be humble, but no. I thought Newcastle played a good mixture of football last season, the likes of Ben Arfa and Cabaye being instrumental in the good style of play.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I&#39;m glad you&#39;re quoting club values, budgets and pundit expectations because it only shows how far Newcastle have come in the last two years, whereas Liverpool have at best stood still despite a substantial cash injection from FSG.
I welcome massive teams coming in with huge offers for our star players because our scouting network has consistently unearthed undervalued gems. With the Carroll money we got Cabaye, Ba and Ciss√©. Liverpool on the other hands have wasted millions on overrated domestic talent and at the same time defended this transfer policy by saying &#34;it was bough with the Torres money so it doesn&#39;t count.&#34; Well I&#39;m afraid it does, especially since like it or not, Liverpool like Newcastle have to make every penny count against the moneybags clubs. I&#39;d rather have Newcastle&#39;s scouting network than Liverpool&#39;s finances any day. Especially since; contrary to what you claim, FSG have made it clear to BR that ¬†he won&#39;t be on the same money that Dalglish had.

As for the &#34;greater pressure&#34; not that hoary old chestnut! We were ahead of you in the league all of last season and you didn&#39;t have¬†European¬†football so that&#39;s a bit weak. If you look at Enrique&#39;s press statements he joined Liverpool to push for Champions league and to get a cap for his national team, he lost his form because none of this happened for him when he moved to Anfield and he was sick as a chip that it was Newcastle and not Liverpool who were pushing for CL until the very last day.

So what if we&#39;re 150/1 to win the PL? We have consistently exceeded expectations and we are moving forward. Liverpool have had a¬†disappointing season on any conceivable scale. The Carling cup is just lipstick on the pig for Liverpool fans who&#39;ll rubbish Newcastle whilst laying claim to half of our¬†squad¬†in the same breath.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Andy,
Once again I don&#39;t think you read my post properly judging from your reply.

I have not quoted any clubs values, any club budgets (they were revenue figures), or for that matter the expectations of any pundits, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;ve got that from to be honest, perhaps you have misunderstood or read something else.

Also nor have I defended the transfer policy by saying we bought players with money from Torres (that said we also sold Alonso for ¬£30 million, Mascherano for ¬£18million to name just two, so don&#39;r forget we generated plenty of cash through other player sales), so again all the points you raise are not relevant to a single thing I said?

Not only that you also say &#34;contrary to what you claim, FSG have made it clear to BR that ¬†he won&#39;t be on the same money that Dalglish had.&#34;¬†¬†- (I&#39;m assuming what you meant was given the same money for players)¬†do please point out where this contrary statement is in my post. ¬†If it&#39;s contrary it would be something along the lines of saying anything what so ever about how much money the board are giving Rodgers, I said no such thing?

One thing I did say you have, it seems, partially misunderstood. Jose had to play more games due to our cup runs, he tired, he wasn&#39;t used to that at Newcastle very simple. Furthermore he&#39;d be somewhat deluded to ever think he&#39;d displace Jordi Alba in the Spain team whoever he played for and whatever his &#39;press statements&#39; were, surely you aren&#39;t naive enough to believe them.
He left for the same reason most players leave a club whilst on the rise of their career path, more money, and the promise of something better (normally under the advice of an agent), he has one, and I expect in the long term he will eventually have both possibly sooner.

As for 150/1 it&#39;s merely an indication of what is expected of you next year as judged by bookmakers, which seems to be not much. You have certainly exceeded expectation for a promoted side, and its interesting you think winning a trophy of any kind should be derided (although it says more about your expectations of success in the eyes of a Liverpool fan than that of your own ambition). Last season it seems for the time being at least has allowed the majority in the Sports Direct Arena to now forget how they felt about Pardew when he arrived, and how they feel/felt for your owner (for the time being) it&#39;s really great, I am happy you&#39;ve all found a better place, what a difference one season makes......

Unfortunately it&#39;s difficult to take anything you have written that seriously though as you seemed to be replying to things I simply never said, still, at least you can spell....!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">A totally hypothetical circumstance so a moot point I&#39;m afraid wouldn&#39;t you say seeing as Torres doesn&#39;t want to come back.¬†

However even if we go along with this hypothetical point unlike Carroll it was his choice to leave for Chelsea, he wasn&#39;t sold against his will because his chairman wanted the cash (and of course you were right to sell him) so I disagree I don&#39;t think many people would be excited at all at that prospect, surely you understand the difference.
Also I can see how Liverpools hands were forced, Torres asked to leave, it&#39;s naive to think Newcastles hands were forced though you cannot (or at least should not) seek to keep a player who wants to leave you are &#39;forced&#39; I think for the good of your club and the other players to let them go, but you should not be &#39;forced&#39; by the prospect of profit, that&#39;s a choice you make, and you made the right one, but you were not forced.I really don&#39;t agree with him having been the &#39;most&#39; feared forward aerially in the P eitherL, gross exaggeration, and it&#39;s not best for all parties that he go back to Newcastle for the price you want to pay for him.Until you meet the asking price (if indeed one has been set) then it&#39;s pointless making an offer, until then he remains an expensive plan B. I don&#39;t know why you want him back anyway, however, in the meantime imagine how it&#39;s making your other two strikers feel after the season they had....I expect rather like Liverpool buying Borini has made Andy Carroll feel, (and the apparent chasing of Dempsey) but he doesn&#39;t have a low release clause in his contract does he.....hmmm....Very unwise by Newscastle if you ask me, but as you say, it&#39;s your call....(I posted this later separately so missed you response, never scrolled down this far again!)</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Hypothetical¬†yes, but you know why I chose it as an example.
You must remember that we rejected the original bid of ¬£30m for Carroll so we wanted to keep him, only for Liverpool&#39;s persistence/panicking/rashness to go an extra five.¬†
We sold because you were willing to overpay, simple as.

Now, when Carroll isn&#39;t required by Rodgers, we are offering you money that you probably won&#39;t get elsewhere and the chance to strike the Carroll conundrum off your balance sheets and move on. That is tempting Liverpool, don&#39;t be fooled.

NUFC hold all the aces, because it&#39;s quite literally a win-win situation for us. We get him back for less and still make profit, or you keep and we still have ¬£35m..

As for Carroll aerially, he was most definitely one of the best headerers of the ball (still is) in the UK. Check out his goals for NUFC before moving, some of them were simply sublime. His goal against Everton in the cup this year was well taken too, as was the one away at Blackburn. Even Didier Drogba claimed that he is indeed one of the best if not the best.I hope we come to a deal because I really don&#39;t think AC has a role in Rodgers&#39; system, not an obvious one anyway.

Regardless, the detailed comment responses are welcomed and encouraged on here. It proves one can have debate without foul or¬†abusive¬†language!¬†Here&#39;s hoping we nab Andy :D</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">You said you were forced to sell, so at least you&#39;ve downgraded that to you sold him ¬†because we were willing to overpay.¬†

Again you reference we&#39;ll get money from you we won&#39;t get elsewhere ( a recurring theme), but so what, we aren&#39;t short of money.
Also I don&#39;t think you hold any aces in terms of a negotiation, we never said we wanted to sell him you made a bid and we refused we aren&#39;t playing a game, and as we can afford to keep him you have no aces. We just mentioned he might be available to loan,and you jumped all over it, and I still don&#39;t know why. Seriously how is Ba feeling when all your fan sites are awash with excitement and comments of how you would &#39;love&#39; AC back, don&#39;t say he&#39;ll be happy.... You won&#39;t admit it, but for him it&#39;s a stepping stone, and 7million in January if you still have him, and he&#39;s still scoring goals is going to look quite attractive to someone......Also you say win win because if you don&#39;t buy him you still have ¬£35million...er....no, you&#39;ve spent rather a lot of that, I keep hearing how well you invested it so that doesn&#39;t wash either...I do agree AC doesn&#39;t look like he has a place in Rodgers system, but i for one was pleased when he said he wanted to fight for his place, and so he should, and we should give him a chance to, especially ¬†if the best price being offered is what you have on the table.Anyway unfortunately it seems most Newcastle fans visiting your site unable to manage without foul or abusive language - read through all their replies to various posts not a reflection to be proud of at all, they do your club no favour at all, but c&#39;est la vie...</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Incorrect again.

I said our &#39;hand was forced&#39; - there&#39;s a¬†differentiation.
The massive offer forced our hand, ¬£30m didn&#39;t. ¬£35m did.

As regards Ba - you&#39;re wrong again, his ¬£7m release clause expires in just under a fortnight and I&#39;m 99.9% sure he&#39;ll be at NUFC on August 1st. He certainly won&#39;t be at Anfield anyway. I doubt he&#39;ll be too fussed about the potential Carroll arrival either - Ba&#39;s almost a guaranteed starter in the team. We need depth for Europe, and since April, we&#39;ve lost Lovenkrands, and Best - so we need to sign a striker. Will it be Andy? Who knows.

We have no aces? Take a look at our team after Andy left, we haven&#39;t even spent half of the AC fee. Ciss√© ¬£9m, Cabaye ¬£4m. The Santon fee came from the Jose Enrique money received. Plus, the Ciss√© deal was financed by Virgin Money&#39;s ¬£10m per annum sponsorship deal that was signed in early 2012 - before Papiss arrived. We didn&#39;t go near the AC money for the forward what ever way you look at it.
So we haven&#39;t spent &#39;rather a lot&#39; at all. Your assumptions are &#39;rather&#39; off sir.

Regards the deal in question, we won&#39;t lose sleep over not landing Carroll, whereas you lot are losing money with each passing day between wages, and in time - depreciation on Carroll&#39;s selling value.

As for the NUFC fans commenting - the majority are clean in their chat, but alongside many of your own LFC faithful; their comments can get heated, and their passion overflows a little bit hastily.¬†
And without sounding too harsh, Liverpool can&#39;t talk about having pleasant fans. The Patrice Evra scenario springs to mind. Don&#39;t stereotype, if you don&#39;t want to be stereotyped.

Either way, only time will what will unfold in the Carroll scenario. If he returns to Tyneside it&#39;ll be a remarkable turn of events - if he doesn&#39;t - we&#39;ll just move on, none the worse off.Can you say the same?

Look forward to next season folks!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I haven&#39;t been &#39;incorrect&#39; in a single thing I have said Kevin, these are called opinions.

As I pointed out, you had a choice, the semantics of the specific words you choose to use are irrelevant, you did not need to sell him your owner made a &#39;decision&#39; to sell a player who clearly didn&#39;t want to leave you were not forced, your hand was not forced, it was business.As for Ba once again this is just conjecture, so it isn;t &#39;wrong&#39;. He will in my &#39;opinion&#39; have seen Newcastle as a stepping stone and as I keep pointing out, I have no idea why you want to spend so much money on Carroll who you are now even appearing to say might well just be simply to add depth to your squad that feels like a change of direction to me (I&#39;ll come back to that).¬†(FYI- I raised the point about Liverpool making an offer for Ba as a vehicle to point out anyone could come in and and take him, I certainly wouldn&#39;t actually want Liverpool to buy him I hope they don&#39;t, and don&#39;t believe they have any intention of doing so.)Furthermore you don&#39;t really think you manager will risk the league by taking Europe seriously do you, you are misguided(again this is an opinion Kevin so please don;t come back and tell me I am incorrect). It&#39;s fairly clear how lucky you were with injuries last year, and as you rightly point out, unlike numerous clubs at the top of the table you have far less strength in depth, you should spend you money more wisely than putting in offers for Carroll.One of the central themes of you article reflected a view that you felt it was &#39;perfect&#39; ( or as close to perfect as you can get) which is ridiculous it bears no reflection on the market, what you really need, and most importantly whether you can afford the asking price (if indeed he is on sale), as you pointed out, you dictated the price of sale to Liverpool, yet now you perhaps it expect the other way around, because you seem to think we want to release him (it took one comment answering a question about a loan move from Rodgers to spark your bid to loan, now buy him back).Once again, no you don&#39;t have any aces, you are basing this on the idea we want to sell and your defence of the idea you hold &#39;aces&#39; is that you probably don&#39;t really need him, or really want to buy him, could be someone else &#39;who knows&#39;?¬†Then don&#39;t write an article, that says you would love to have him back, and that it would be as close to &#39;perfect&#39; as it could be be the two now don&#39;t tally up. Your subsequent replies to me appear to show you back tracking, either back up what you said, or accept it was misguided given what what you already have, and the position of your club currently.

AS for the money, the point you raise is nonsense, it&#39;s like saying we didn&#39;t buy Carroll with the Torres money, it was with the money from Alonso and Mascherano, it&#39;s irrelevant where the clubs finances &#39;come&#39; from for any specific transfer. So to say you have &#39;still&#39; got 35million (which was what I made the point about) is nonsense. You HAVE spent rather a lot of money, the rest is back in his pocket for now. Remember how long you all complained he hadn&#39;t spent the Carroll the money for.....all forgotten now I assume. However you are also saying he still has all 35 million of it, it makes no sense I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s one or the other, not both.

As for the people your site has attracted the &#39;majority&#39; certainly do not I&#39;m afraid it is more a minority, a disappointing visit. As I said just have a glance through you must be very proud of these people.

As for the debate, you&#39;ve gone from saying &#34;Personally, I would love to see Andy back at St.James‚Äô Park pulling on the Black and White stripes.&#34; &amp;amp; &#34;Some things are just perfect. ....... is probably as close as perfect can get when it comes to football&#34;¬†

to¬†

&#34;Either way, only time will what will unfold in the Carroll scenario. If he returns to Tyneside it&#39;ll be a remarkable turn of events - if he doesn&#39;t - we&#39;ll just move on, none the worse off.&#34;


Quite a different feel to the emotion and sentiment of these &#39;opinions&#39; from start to finish.

Good luck in Europe, good luck in the league, I hope you stay injury free, and I do hope you spend the 35million you still have (!?) improving your squad, whatever it is you&#39;d love and is perfect for you I wish you all the best with it.¬†

Remember this, we&#39;ll only sell Carroll if we don&#39;t want him at the club it won&#39;t be because are &#39;hands are forced&#39;, the money doesn&#39;t matter to us, our objectives are all about getting our manager what he wants, an enviable position to be in wouldn&#39;t you say.....

All I know is realistically we can&#39;t do much worse next year ( we&#39;ll forgot the cups), and you can&#39;t do much better.....just my opinion.....I might pop back and see what you have to say about it all in a few weeks time once the reality kicks in</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">I think you&#39;re missing my point regards us being &#39;forced to sell&#39; but I&#39;ll leave that one be.

The article in question harboured on the fact that in terms of a transfer deal, things couldn&#39;t have went much better than they did. We invested *some* of the AC cash wisely; we replaced him with a better striker in Papiss and even Demba; we had a memorable season, best in years; financially we&#39;re in a very good state and looking towards the future. Now, Carroll isn&#39;t wanted after his big money move, and personally wants a transfer back to NUFC - that&#39;s no secret. If that&#39;s not Newcastle United triumphing in the wake of losing their, then star man - then I don&#39;t know what is.

As for the Ciss√© money coming out of the AC fee, I firmly believe it didn&#39;t. It&#39;s a fair point referring to past transfers, but NUFC operate in a FIFO type method when it comes to the finances at St.James&#39; Park.I don&#39;t think referencing transfers from 2008 at Liverpool really bear too much relevance here, especially as I&#39;m talking about the same year¬†signings¬†were made.

Also, you say I&#39;m wrong in claiming that your statement of Ba being able to leave for ¬£7m *next January* was incorrect? Clearly, you got it wrong and as documented, his contract clause expires at the end of this month. As well as that, for the most - you&#39;re claiming my opinion is wrong, which is quite ironic of the highest order.

You mentioned that we were lucky with injuries? You make your own luck in this league, and frankly the investment in top tech equipment, proper training and rest periods, and first class medical care are to thank for our lack of injuries last season. We still had a number of absentees - Marveaux, Best, Coloccini, and Taylor. The last two, very important first teamers, and indeed captain.

I&#39;ve made it no secret that I would like Carroll back, and that it would be the cherry on the top, so to speak. The transfer scenario is perfect as is, whether he arrives or not. However, if we do get him back for somewhere in the region of ¬£15m - it&#39;s been an¬†absolute¬†masterstroke by everyone at NUFC from the board to Pardew.Will we lose sleep over not getting him? Absolutely not.Will be delighted to get him for less than half what we received, just a year later? Of course, he&#39;s still a very talented CF. ¬£17m is too high for my liking of course, but unfortunately if we are to lure him it won&#39;t be for ¬£12m!

&#34;All I know is realistically we can&#39;t do much worse next year ( we&#39;ll forgot the cups), and you can&#39;t do much better.....just my opinion.....I might pop back and see what you have to say about it all in a few weeks time once the reality kicks in¬†&#34;

That&#39;s for sure, Rodgers will need time and patience for his plan to work.¬†Hopefully¬†he&#39;ll be given that time for LFC&#39;s sake.Thankfully, reality is always present on Tyneside because we know how quickly fortunes can change, especially with Mike in charge.¬†

I look forward to good season, and hopefully Papiss can repeat his feat at St.James&#39; against you lot once more :D</p>
