				<p><img src="https://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Vurnon-Anita-Ajax.jpg" alt="Vurnon Anita in action for Ajax" title="Vurnon-Anita-Ajax" /></p>

<p>#### Anita - Highly rated by the Newcastle scouting team and likely to arrive</p>

<p>First off, there&rsquo;s a couple of rumours going around that Tim Krul has been subject to a £10m bid from Harry Redknapp&rsquo;s Tottenham Hotspurs. If this is the case, then I&rsquo;m sure the NUFC hierarchy will only laugh off the bid and tell Harry that Timmy&rsquo;s left hand isn&rsquo;t for sale. £10m?! For one of the keepers of the season - in a side that finished just off the Champions League spots - ten million wouldn&rsquo;t cover half the keepers fee. At the very least I&rsquo;d be looking for £25m for Krul , although he has reiterated his desire to play for Newcastle United in the years to come, and is out in Ukraine with the Dutch international side on hand to grab the #1 jersey, so we really shouldn&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p>Even a lot of Newcastle United fans have put a £15m price tag on Krul, which is far too low considering the season he had with us.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many keepers better than him in the country at the minute, and he&rsquo;s up with the best of them in Europe as well.</p>

<p>On top of that, he&rsquo;s only gone 24 years-old, and hasn&rsquo;t played his prime days yet so there&rsquo;s more to come from the Dutchman.</p>

<p>Anyway we needn&rsquo;t worry about losing him for £10m as there&rsquo;s more chance of Lionel Messi arriving on Tyneside than Tim leaving for ten big ones.</p>

<p>In other news, our bid for Vurnon Anita has been rejected. A reported fee of £4m was offered to the Dutch giants, but Alan Pardew has been told to double his offer before coming back again.</p>

<p>Anita, who can play defensive mid, or left-back would offer a lot to the squad, and is a very talented player. I personally, happen to be delighted that we are looking to land the 23 year old.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s fast, and thanks to amino acids, he is a very strong athlete. He&rsquo;d be the perfect acquisition for Newcastle United in my opinion, but whether we&rsquo;ll go to £8m for his services I don&rsquo;t know, probably not. An offer of about £6.5m should lure him over to Tyneside all going well, and make him our second signing of the summer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how things fare out in the market, and oddly enough - Yohan Cabaye says he has an interesting announcement to make to NUFC fans very soon. He had the following two Tweets:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comment vont mes twittos ?? Je reviens vite vers vous pour proposer quelque chose qui pourra peut être vous intéresser..</p>

<p>Hope you good my twittos ??? Speak to you soon about something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Practically the same meaning when translated, but it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what he has to say.</p>

<p>Perhaps Debuchy is close to joining us? 😀</p>

<p>Certainly after his stellar performance yesterday against England, it&rsquo;d be nice if Alan Pardew would move quickly and try to get things done - even if it was through Yohan 😀</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts? Will Krul stay? Will we sign Anita? Will Debuchy join his best mate at St.James&rsquo; Park?</p>

<p>Make sure you&rsquo;re following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/tynetime">Twitter</a> - we&rsquo;ll break any news we have there, in seconds.</p>

<p>Also, take a read of my latest article on how NUFC are approaching the most important transfer window in a decade.</p>

You only have one player worth more than £12m and that&#39;s Cisse. 1 season sharing your hob nobs with the elite is not an arrival. You punched above your weight and had incredible season but perspective. Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool will not have such inconsistency again. Well, Liverpool might but that still puts you behind city, united, arsenal, spurs and Chelsea. You&#39;re best players stay yours all the while none of the above want them.</p>

I&#39;m not saying any of your players would push for moves to Spurs,but should Spurs come in for them they would almost certainly choose to join us....and before you come back with a reference to the size of your crowds blah blah blah,remember Spurs are building a new ground which will be ready in 3 or 4 years time.</p>

Considering we could get someone better like Vorm of Swansea or Stekelenburg of Roma for £15m why would we pay that stupid amount of money? First of all, he is not good enough for Spurs, secondly he comes from a second-rate club and thirdly we have better options. Carry on playing fifa mate!</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">That sounds more likely - although imo Krul a good deal better than Vorm who i wouldn&#39;t really want.

Really does depend on whether an offer is ever put in that is too big for the owner to reject - and Spurs aren&#39;t really in the habit of putting in &#39;too good to refuse&#39; offers !.

Your fantastic 5th place and our failure to grab 3rd has probably scuppered any deal though in all honesty.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Fair enough, but with all due respect to Spurs, your own star players are just as vulnerable to clubs that can guarantee champions league year in year out. I&#39;ve noticed that Spurs and Liverpool fans in particular are over-keen to try and put us in &#34;our place&#34; because your own clubs are higher on the pecking order but still vulnerable to someone else coming up and upsetting the &#34;established order&#34;. Fact is some of our players might leave, but why should they go to Spurs when they can go to bigger teams like Man City, Chelsea etc? Spurs simply aren&#39;t big enough to come in and take our players.</p>

Anyway, if i was a Spurs fan i&#39;d be more concerned with trying to keep Modric, Bale etc... at the moment. The tides could well be turning.</p>

If someone wants to buy one of our players they need to pay what we want for him (not what hes worth) - unless the player himself wants to go - which Krul doesnt. Ashely turned down £30m then £35m for Carroll - it was only when Carroll handed in a transfer request did we accept. THATS GOOD BUSINESS!

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Wrong. 2 seasons actually. Also he&#39;s 24 which means he has another 15 years on his career. He played a huge part in our 5th place finish and  you say &#34;Holland&#39;s second keeper&#34; as if Holland is some pushover underdog team instead of world cup finalists. Fact is Krul would be the first-choice keeper for any number of nationalities and he&#39;s years off his peak.

But all of this doesn&#39;t really matter. I want Krul to stay at Newcastle, so if you think he&#39;s only worth 8 million, then look somewhere else because he&#39;s not leaving for that.</p>

Krul will leave and have we forgot goalkeepers don&#39;t sell for BIG money. $10mil that&#39;s a lot of money and Ashley will take it.

What you don&#39;t seem to understand is that because of some very wise buying and some very long term contracts Newcastle are in a strong position when people (supposedly) some in for our players- to the extent that we can comand a price that would make it daft not to sell. Our owner and team obviously have got to the position where we tie people up for a good few years and then consider selling if we could improve the squad by doing so or are offered a price which would make that all worthwhile. So in reality, an offer of about 25 mil could be accepted (not because that is what we all think Krul is worth (you moron) but because that would justify the rigmarole of selling him). And for the record, Newcastle fans are not deluded, do not expect to be established top 5 now and do not think we are a &#39;massive&#39; club - it&#39;s just idiots like you who maintain that view of what we (don&#39;t) think. We have an excellent record in the prem bar one relegation and (without checking) I believe we have appeared in the Champions League more times than Tottenham.</p>

The last few seasons have not been so good for us but your own club has had many a spell in the wilderness. Tim Krul is currently pushing Steklenburg hard for the number one shirt in Holland (world cup finalists) and Vorm is being kept outta the squad. You may even find Krul as the number one for the next match. I feel for your club as the team play nice football and the club is run well but your fans are far too big for the boots considering your a team that has never finished higher than 4th in the Prem. I have to hope Harry leaves you lot and the good old days of you languishing in the bottom half of the table returns.</p>

They have 18 year old Jak Alnwick (younger bro of spuds Ben) to come in the future and a really good 14 year old keeper in Freddie Woodman who has already played for the reserve team.

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">5under1and paid 10mill for Gordon who was older, unproven in a decent league, poor injury record just cos of his potential.  So 5 years later when prices are higher why would we sell krill for 10 million. There is no doubt a top prem proven young keeper is worth at least 17 mill the extra 8mill is what we&#39;d ask just to sweeten the deal as we know his value is only going up up up, if he carries on at the rate he is he can and will be in the top 5 keepers in Europe! He isn&#39;t far off now!! Yous do business the same ie berba!! He wasn&#39;t worth over 30 but you didn&#39;t need to sell and screwed them over. The same as we will to anyone on long deals, we have no problems getting rid of players for small amounts when they want off or on short deals, Guthrie free, Barton free, Nolan 4mill, Enrique 6. Swings and roundabouts!!</p>

Keepers are often the most expensive member of a team.

Gordon cost £10m.de Gea cost £17m
To name but two transfers.And Lloris won&#39;t leave for £10m, unless he&#39;s in the last year of his contract!</p>

Your ginger minger Arry the Spiv is leaving the sinking ship chasing Arab gold..  Take the 16 goals Adebaoyor scored for you and you would be outside the top seven you clowns,

Chelsea and Arsenal are the big two in London always will be and Arsenal are a feeder club for Man City.

Man City and Man United are the top dogs in England but Chelsea will be there or there abouts next season.

Spurs you will win nowt yet again..</p>

Get your facts right Man United, Man City and Newcastle have waiting lists.  I work with Liverpool and they certainly don&#39;t. 
As for 5 0 yes two on loan players scored 4 goals I remember. Still never made the Champions League though ha ha come on you Chelski.  What was the score in the FA Cup Semi Final 5 - 1 you were outclassed.  Anyway must be passed your bed time.  Enjoy Grange Hill tomorrow you horrible southern w8nker.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1"> Hahahahaha.... retard.

I can assure you that 90%&#43; of Spurs fans didn&#39;t want the Olympic stadium. Especially in it&#39;s current form, we couldnt play somewhere with so little soul. Leave that to the other teams across town.

So every summer there is constant media links of Modric, Bale, VdV to Europes elite. Adebayor has said he wants to sort out a deal to stay with us. Even our young right back who has played 1 season with us is being linked to Real Madrid. 

We have a whole reserve team of internationals and our plans for a new stadium have received planning permission...

So not really sure what you are talking about there... You&#39;ve had a great season, but don&#39;t get ahead of yourselves. The amount the top teams are investing, it&#39;s hard for anyone aiming for a top 6 finish.</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">You could argue, they way the league stands now, no one is sure for a CL place finish in the league. Who would have thought Chelsea would finish 6th? Or Liverpool? They have both invested huge amounts in recent years. As have city. M Utd you expect to always be up there, but their squad isn&#39;t as dominating as it has been in past, so maybe they could miss out..Spurs missed out, even finishing 4th. Arsenal were lucky this year too.. It could all change next year. Will be interesting, just hope Spurs keep what we have in the squad and add a couple here and there where needed.

They&#39;re giving it large on here but go on any of their forums and most of them want bagpuss out, the only manager to give Spurs any recent success. What deluded fans.

Twitch will leave, Modric wants to and Spurs will not replace with similar quality.

No way 4th next year and then it&#39;s bye bye bale and hello mid table.

Spurs are a laughing stock at the moment and they know it. Levy is even risking ruining a deal on Dutch league player of the year over a couple of warranted mill, as if he&#39;ll pay for krul!!!</p>

Finally I think you&#39;ll find we would fill our new stadium as we have 5 year waiting list for season tickets.

Spurs fell apart and were an excuse for a team in the last few months.....but they still finished above you. And by the way, we fill 36,000 every game and have 30,000 waiting for season tickets.  Roll on the new stadium, which will be bigger than the Reebok or whatever your sweaty stadium is called. </p>

Krul is defo worth more than £10 mill but nowhere near £25mil, cabaye is a good player and u will be lucky if u can keep him for another year. U guys need to make sure you don&#39;t do a hull nxt season, cos if u had to deal with the injuries we had to cope with it is more than plausible.
