				<p><img src="https://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Alan-Pardew-NUFC.jpg" alt="Alan Pardew looks on from the dug-out at St.James' Park" title="Alan-Pardew-NUFC" /></p>

<p>####¬†Pardew - Get the feeling all is not well under the covers at St.James&rsquo; Park</p>

<p>It could well be just me, but I think there is something pretty serious going on at Newcastle United right now and it might not be very encouraging at all. Recent criticisms of the board and their regime have been well documented in the press the last week or so, with Jose Enrique openly venting his frustration at Mike Ashley and the lack of ambition show by the club. Then in the last couple  of days Joey Barton seemingly took the baton from the Spaniard and also questioned the future of the club and it&rsquo;s stance on transfers. Again, the former English international confirmed he had no intentions of leaving Newcastle United anytime in the near future. As for Jose, I couldn&rsquo;t care less what he has to say much longer; he is just trying to¬†maneuver a move for himself. In fact I&rsquo;d be looking to sell the left-back before the window if we can because at the very least we deserve some cash for the guy; sticking by him in the Championship and all that.</p>

<p>Bringing it back to my headline however; am I the only one who thinks that there is something a lot more serious going on at the club than meets the eye? Every time the press talk to Pardew it&rsquo;s the same old story where he&rsquo;s trying to get two more players in, then it&rsquo;s one more signing, then a couple more additions and before we know it - the deadline is fast¬†approaching.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many times we&rsquo;ve heard that hard work is being done behind closed doors to get players in, but I&rsquo;ve a hunch, and a pretty big one at that, that Mr.Pardew is close to cracking point with Mike over transfers. I&rsquo;ve no doubt Pardew has a list of players he wants, but I&rsquo;d be fairly certain he has been given a cold &lsquo;No&rsquo; on countless occasions so far on prospective signings.</p>

<p>It seems as if we&rsquo;re after a very certain player. A young, high potential star with large sell on value. I like that idea as mentioned before, and I&rsquo;m fully in favour of it. However, sometimes you have to make allowances for a certain type of player. If there is a player out there that can add something to the team and he is 26 or so; providing he&rsquo;s available for a good price then sign him up. I think this might be the ¬†case with Pardew, but Ashley is adamant on sticking with both his financial and player policies at the club.</p>

<p>In all honesty, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Alan Pardew resigned or was sacked in the coming weeks: it really wouldn&rsquo;t. I get that eerily feeling surrounding the club that I did in years gone by. Mike Ashley could be wearing Pardew&rsquo;s patience thin.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being too negative but you have to prepare for all possibilities, especially as a Newcastle United fan.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get things straight though - I&rsquo;m not complaining about our transfer dealings this summer (much). We&rsquo;ve already signed quality in Cabaye, Marveaux, Ba and seemingly Abeid as well. That is all very encouraging. In fact it sometimes sickens me to hear some NUFC fans moaning about guys we haven&rsquo;t signed, or who we could sign - simply because they either have no idea of the players we have actually signed, or because they&rsquo;re living in the past. We are no longer a force in the transfer market - grow up.</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;m quite happy with the business we&rsquo;ve done but we do need a couple more: predominately a striker. With Erding looking like he might stay we have to work towards other targets, and I don&rsquo;t mean Jermain Defoe or Peter Crouch. Stay well away from those two. Who does Alan Pardew turn to now? Any point trying for someone like Gabriel Agbonlahor?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my two cents on the whole last month or so anyway!</p>

The purse strings should be loosened if we are to finish in the top half of the league I think its about time the owner showed some ambition and brought in a big money buy.

The problem is he&#39;s a gutless nobody and he doesn&#39;t command the players&#39; respect. Don&#39;t fine them after committing an offence, ban them from doing it in the first place...be a strong manager. You wouldn&#39;t last 2 seconds at ManUre if you said anything negative about that club....Fergie simply wouldn&#39;t stand for it, he&#39;s given some of the best players in the world the boot for discussing basic training methods. Pardew isn&#39;t a &#34;more experienced manager&#34;, he&#39;s just a puppet and I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to put up with it for much longer...as long as we.stay in the Prem that&#39;s enough for Ashley. I can&#39;t criticise his willingness to balance the books but I can criticise his choices of manager and chairman. The only hope of us qualifying for Europe in the next 5 years is by default when all the clubs above us are disqualified for having low turnover....</p>

            <p class="f5-ns f6 db black-70 mv1">Ah man Dooce, they&#39;ve worn you down?

Why are we happy to accept mediocrity? What is stopping us being any kind of force in the transfer market? Nothing that we didn&#39;t have before as it happens and we were so inclined. You just need to be shrewd, ambitious and speculate a little.

Can&#39;t believe you&#39;re not happy with Jose. Why is it we stuck with him and if doesn&#39;t work the other way. Yes, he&#39;s on good money but aside from a blip at the end last year, he&#39;s been one of our stand out performers for 2 and a bit years.

The truth about our signing is that we must watch and wait. The worrying thing is that Pardew only wants one more in, while around him the squad could easily be weakened further. If we&#39;re such a poor force in the transfer market, how do you expect us just to matter of factly go and pick up the likes of Agbonlahor? Only those unaware of how we operate will come here. Don&#39;t be surprised if Tiote&#39;s &#39;Visa&#39; issues are a smokescreen. Plenty of time left to move people on.

I wouldn&#39;t worry about Pardew. He&#39;s irrelevant in all of this. He&#39;s like Mike&#39;s first lady, just here to look smart and say the right things.

Why oh why is it everytime as a Newcastle fan at the start of the close season I was full of hope and excited at what was to come. But now I just hoping we stay up and the seasons over. Because you know that at the next transfer window tiote will be off , that&#39;s if he gets his visa sorted out!!!!!!!</p>

Pardew&#39;s authority at the club clearly doesn&#39;t extend to the transfer budget, but it certainly sounds as though he needs to assert his authority on the players more. Of course, he may have done this, but the want away players couldn&#39;t give a hoot anyway. We&#39;re better off without Barton, and Enrique should either take a new contract or get out. The players are making us look more farcical than the board at the moment.</p>

He&#39;s on seriously good money - and there wasn&#39;t a huge array of clubs looking for his signature when we were relegated.¬†If he just came out and said he wanted to leave then fair enough - but when you refuse to sit down at the table to even consider a new contract offer it leaves a lot to be desired.¬†Only time will tell regards the rest though!</p>
