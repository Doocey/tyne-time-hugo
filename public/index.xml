      <title>The future of Newcastle United has never been so delicately poised</title>

      <description>Being a Newcastle United supporter has never been easy, even during some of the better times. For a club that has suffered two relegations from the top flight of English football in rather quick succession, perhaps pointing to the past decade would have you thinking that the worst is in the rear-view mirror. On the face of it, maybe that looks to be true. Newcastle United have a squad of fighters, the majority, if not all of the current players want to be at St.</description>

      <title>What would a failed manager like Tim Sherwood know about Newcastle United?</title>

      <description>You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be faulted for failing to remember who exactly Tim Sherwood is, but if you want a quick recap, he&amp;rsquo;s the snake that ousted Andre Villa Boas during his curious tenure at White Hart Lane before being sacked himself. Based on his endeavours at Spurs, he landed the gig at Aston Villa, a club in real peril languishing just about the relegation zone. He took over a broken dressing-room and managed to keep them in the Premier League, as well as reaching an FA Cup where they were trounced by Arsenal.</description>

      <title>Lee Charnley is finally learning what it takes to run a football club</title>

      <description>Lee Charnley is name most Newcastle United supporters have come to know in recent years, and mostly for the wrong reasons. He has been labelled a &amp;lsquo;puppet&amp;rsquo; for the regime under Mike Ashley as the 38 year-old sat through two relegations behind the scenes at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. Inexperienced and overloaded with responsibility, it was Lee Charnley who gave the thumbs up to appoint Steve McClaren in a predictably disastrous season, and he was also entrusted with the decision to either fire or stay loyal to McClaren in a key point of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s 2015&amp;frasl;16 Premier League season - a decision, coupled with the former, which led to Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s demise into the second tier of English football.</description>

      <description>Townsend - Gave everything to help try keep NUFC in the Premier League
Crystal Palace completed the £13m signing of Andros Townsend from Newcastle United Friday last,&amp;nbsp;with the England winger departing St. James&amp;rsquo; Park having just arrived in January of 2016. The move did not come as a surprise to most Newcastle supporters as Townsend had raised his profile with a string of fine performances in an ultimately fatal&amp;nbsp;season on Tyneside.</description>

      <description>Over the past few seasons, Newcastle United fans have often looked forward to release of season fixtures. For me, it was always an immediate glance to the month of December to see what teams we faced. Then, a quick scan of April and May before forming an opinion on whether Newcastle United would be safe from the threat of relegation from the Premier League (And the they say NUFC fans are deluded!</description>

      <description>I remember the very day Steve McClaren was appointed Newcastle United manager. There was a strong feeling of disappointment on my part, and indeed the majority of other Newcastle United supporters. It just didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense from a footballing point of view, but marked a very predictable move by Managing Director, Lee Charnley. Mr. Charnley has been at the club for longer than you might imagine, indeed resident pre-Ashley era. Now, there is little doubt that the man is likely a very committed worker, and a thorough professional.</description>

      <title>Newcastle United – doing things the right way but is it all too late?</title>

      <description>The close of the January transfer window marked a reasonably successful recruitment drive from Newcastle United. They managed to secure the signings of raw British talent in the form of Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend, while also adding Champions League pedigree to their ranks with the acquisition of Roma&amp;rsquo;s Seydou Doumbia on loan until the end of the season. Yet, the murmurs from St. James&amp;rsquo; Park suggest that there was slight disappointment in the failure to land West Bromwich Albion&amp;rsquo;s Saido Berahino.</description>

      <title>Steve McClaren, mayhem and the mess at Newcastle United</title>

      <description>McClaren - Failing to make the transition from Championship to Premier League We are now thirteen games into the new Premier League season at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park and being perfectly honest, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered writing an article on this squad or this football club but duties call, and a post is due. My last piece on Coloccini committing his future to the club dates back to the start of August, and unfortunately, he has since signed a new deal to keep him on Tyneside for the foreseeable future.</description>

      <description>Coloccini - Reportedly plans on ending his playing career at Newcastle United There have been many questions raised about the future of current Newcastle United captain, Fabricio Coloccini as the new season approaches. The 33 year-old Argentine joined The Magpies in a £10m deal from Deportivo La Coruna and became one of Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s first signings in his second stint in charge of the club. While many managers and players have come and gone since 2008, Coloccini has - surprisingly - stayed on Tyneside those seven years and became something of an adopted Geordie alongside the recently released, Jonas Gutierrez.</description>

      <description>There is a reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t written very much about Newcastle United in the past 12 months. Actually, there&amp;rsquo;s a numbers of reasons. I no longer really enjoy it. I no longer enjoy trying to look at the bright side at Newcastle United as a football club because at this moment in time, it&amp;rsquo;s pointless. Newcastle United isn&amp;rsquo;t a football club anymore, indeed it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been one for a very long time.</description>

      <description>Ameobi - Will find out whether he has merited a new contract at St. James&amp;rsquo; in May.
Samuel Oluwaseyi J. &amp;lsquo;Sammy&amp;rsquo; Ameobi was the talk of Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s youth academy a matter of years ago. He was dubbed as something special, with incredible feet, lighting pace, and creativity by the bucket loads. He was set to keep the famous Ameobi lineage going at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. In fact, he seemed to believe the hype himself.</description>

You may have completed plenty of NUFC quizzes throughout the week, or even today alone, but its unlikely you&amp;rsquo;ll have met the nature of the questions that Tyne Time&amp;rsquo;s Toon Trivia entails.</description>

      <title>Newcastle in pole position for Dele Alli as Villa try to hijack deal</title>

      <description>Dele Alli looks set to become a Newcastle United player before the close of the transfer window, despite late efforts from Aston Villa to hijack the deal. It has been well reported throughout the past fortnight that NUFC have been keeping tabs on the highly rated 18 year-old midfielder, and various media outlets claim that the sides agreed a deal over the past day. The fee in question is expected to be £5m, with the Milton Keynes-born prospect expected to stay at his current club until the end of the season as MK Dons attempt a promotion push.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Thursday evening and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest - there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to do aside from refreshing Twitter with the hope that Newcastle United have sensationally unveiled Frank de Boer as their new head-coach. Either that, or you could read the countless, substance-less rumours about Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s transfer ambitions this January. You might even want to read about Moussa Sissoko&amp;rsquo;s impending departure from St. James&amp;rsquo; Park, or the news that Jonas Gutierrez seems set for a move back to his native Argentina, soon to be followed by Fabricio Coloccini when the summertime calls.</description>

      <description>Few Newcastle United fans will forget Sir Bobby Robson&amp;rsquo;s era. It was filled with great memories, from De Kuip to the San Siro - Stadium of Light to Elland Road. During the height of his reign, we were one of strongest teams in the Premier League and at one stage, looked like a contender for the title. Those were the days; Alan Shearer in his finest form, a back four that didn&amp;rsquo;t concede goals by the bucket load, but more importantly, a club that every single NUFC fan could be proud of, led by a gentleman who also happened to be an incredibly astute coach.</description>

      <description>There is little doubt that if given the chance, 99% of Newcastle United fans would appoint Frank de Boer as the club&amp;rsquo;s new head coach. What an incredible upgrade he would be on the departed Alan Pardew. The Dutchman would arrive to a hero&amp;rsquo;s welcome at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park and there would be a feeling of great optimism around Tyneside upon his appointment. Sadly, the chances of the ex-Barcelona defender taking the reins at Newcastle are non-existent at this moment in time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, it brings me great pleasure to be able to write this article at the start of a new year. Alan Pardew has finally packed his bags and left Newcastle United after four years in charge. I think most NUFC fans were beginning the accept the sad fact that Pardew was not going to be sacked, especially when the club enter a truly horrid period of form at the start of the season.</description>

      <description>Another trip to the Emirates Stadium and another pitiful performance. As per usual, the trip to Arsenal saw Newcastle United beaten by a three goal margin. This time Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla teamed up to tear our defence asunder – the former seemingly finding world-class form against us Magpies to chip in with two top quality goals. Cazorla’s first was a thing of beauty, delicately piercing the top corner from an acute angle, leaving NUFC’s third choice keeper Jak Alnwick stranded, a position in which he remained throughout the remainder of the 90 minutes.</description>

      <description>When Jack Colback completed a free transfer to Newcastle United from bitter rivals Sunderland, few would have imagined that the 24 year-old would become the first name on the teamsheet at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. As many of you will know from reading my articles, Jack Colback is someone I always rated, particularly during his time at Sunderland, in other words, I did fancy him to evolve into a very good midfielder on Tyneside, but perhaps not so soon.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United are ready to strengthen their forward line with the signing of Anderlecht&amp;rsquo;s Aleksandar Mitrovic for a fee in the region of £10m - according to the Telegraph. Our senior striker, Papiss Cissé, has enjoyed a mixed start to the 2014&amp;frasl;15 season, with injuries dominating the headlines. A recurring knee injury has kept the Senegalese international out of action for the past month, and although young Ayoze Perez has been filled the void more than sufficiently, head scout Graham Carr and manager Alan Pardew want another striker in the door as soon as possible.</description>

      <description>As Newcastle United supporters begrudgingly prepare for the dreaded international break, it gives us all time to look back on what has been a superb return to form. 5 straight victories, including four successive Premier League wins has left Toon fans wondering where it all went right. The majority will heap praise on manager Alan Pardew for turning things around, but when I say majority, I mean the media and onlookers outside of the north-east.</description>

      <description>When Newcastle United scampered down the tunnel after a ridiculously poor first half showing against Tottenham Hotspur, Toon fans began to ask the question - what kind of gameplan did NUFC really bring to White Hart Lane? Whatever the idea of the first 45 minutes happened to be, it was nothing short of appalling. We didn&amp;rsquo;t create a chance, and the majority of the players didn&amp;rsquo;t look bothered about representing the shirt they were wearing.</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but have a good laugh to myself when I heard that Mike Ashley had visited the home dressing-room after Saturday&amp;rsquo;s 1-0 victory over Leicester City to congratulate the players on securing their first Premier League win of the season. It just proved to countless NUFC and myself - something we already knew: Mike Ashley has no understanding of the game. When Leicester City failed to take their chances in front of goal and Gabriel Obertan eventually went on to score a fine solo effort to secure all three points, it was an almost embarrassing victory.</description>

      <description>When Peter Crouch easily rose above captain Fabricio Coloccini to nod home what turned out to be Stoke City&amp;rsquo;s winner, it was all too familiar for Newcastle United fans. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t despair, no head in hands, no tears. A sense of acceptance swept through a wet Brittania Stadium. Then, as per the last few games, chants and banners dominated the TV screens as the majority of Newcastle supporters voiced their anger, and demands to the away dugout.</description>

      <description>The atmosphere promised to be toxic. That very word had been bandied around the offices of every media outlet covering Newcastle United ahead of their home encounter with Hull City. The SackPardew campaign had gone down seamlessly and was going nicely up until kick-off. As crowds filtered into St. James&amp;rsquo; Park, security guards confiscated hundreds of banners and posters, despite the protesters being given a written go-ahead from the club and the local police.</description>

      <description>With less than 20 hours till Newcastle United play host to what is expected to be the most toxic atmosphere in the club&amp;rsquo;s history, club &amp;lsquo;captain&amp;rsquo; Fabricio Coloccini has called on supporters to come out and give the team their full backing when they take to St. James&amp;rsquo; Park against Hull City. Coloccini, who arrived on Tyneside in 2008 under Kevin Keegan has gone on to become on of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s finest defenders in recent years, however, over the past 12 months, the Argentine has lost the respect of a considerable number of supporters, including myself.</description>

      <description>I have often felt some sort of empathy towards Newcastle United managers in the past who have been shown the door at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. In fact, in years gone-by, &amp;lsquo;revolving door&amp;rsquo; became a common buzzword on Tyneside when talking about managers. Realistically, Sir Bobby Robson should never have been sacked in 2004 after the club drifted just outside the Champions League places. From then on, things just got worse. His replacement Graeme Souness couldn&amp;rsquo;t hack it in the North-East, although certain personalities in the dressing-room made it even more difficult for the Scot to succeed.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have today released a statement on behalf of Mike Ashley dismissing a recent claim by the Telegraph that the English billionaire is looking to sell the club. In a relatively brief statement released on the club&amp;rsquo;s official website, the publication informed the public of a banning order imposed upon the _Telegraph_ newspaper, and indeed the author behind the articles, Luke Edwards. Mr. Ashley quite clearly did not take well to the recent releases in the age-old newspaper and has decided that Edwards and all staff at the Telegraph are no longer allowed in the grounds of St.</description>

      <description>There are very few professions in the world that people often pray/beg/call for the sacking of an individual from his day job. Politics and football are an exception, and these are two things Mr. Alan Pardew is well used to both at Newcastle United since taking control in 2010. One could be forgiven for looking in from the outside and coming to the conclusion that Newcastle fans can never be pleased; after all Pardew was the same guy who led the Magpies to brink of Champions League football in 2011&amp;frasl;12 only to miss out in the final two games.</description>

      <description>According to the well-respected Graeme Bailey formerly of Sky Sports, Newcastle are hoping to conclude a deal for Atletico Madrid&amp;rsquo;s Toby Alderweireld before the transfer window closes on Monday. The Magpies slipped to a 3-3 draw against Crystal Palace on Saturday in the dying embers, after it looked like youngster Rolando Aarons had secured the club&amp;rsquo;s first three points of the new Premier League campaign. Despite Mike Williamson scoring his first ever goal in Black and White, it is quite clear that a new centre-back is needed on Tyneside to complement Fabricio Coloccini and eventually, replace him entirely.</description>

      <description>Hatem Ben Arfa - where to start? The Frenchman is without doubt one of the most exciting players I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in Black and White. The sense of excitement when he received the ball on either flank and looked to drive at defenders. His ability to spot a pass, or indeed use his yard of pace to burst clear of a couple of challenges and leave his markers for dead. Those were the good days under Hatem Ben Arfa.</description>

      <description>Few football fans will ever forget Papiss Cissé&amp;rsquo;s incredible effort against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge during the 2011&amp;frasl;12 Premier League season. The Senegalese international rifled an almost physics-defying &amp;lsquo;banana effort&amp;rsquo; over Petr Cech&amp;rsquo;s head and into the back of the net to complete one of the best Premier League braces I have seen in quite some time. After that season came to a close, the real Cissé seemed to disappear. Following Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s exit from the Europa League to Benfica at the Quarter-finals stage, Papiss failed to find any real form and the club&amp;rsquo;s season suffered from then on - narrowly avoiding relegation.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United finished off their pre-season campaign with a narrow 1-0 victory over Spanish side Real Sociedad at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park courtesy of a goal from Moussa Sissoko two minutes from time. The game - streamed live by the visitors on their officials club website - fans who did not have the pleasure of attending the game in person, were able to watch Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s new signings in action on the hallowed turf of St.</description>

      <description>I posed a question on Twitter a couple of days ago about what direction Newcastle United can now go in their pursuit of another forward. Their main targets this summer: Loic Rémy and Alexandre Lacazette have all confirmed that their futures lie elsewhere, and Borussia Dortmund&amp;rsquo;s Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, who has long been admired by officials at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park, does not look any closer to an exit from the Bundesliga despite reports that he could be obtained for as little as £7m this summer.</description>

      <description>In a summer that has been dominated - and thankfully so - by in the impressive, swift action taken by Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s in the transfer window, the club&amp;rsquo;s latest pre-season outing in New Zealand against saw 18 year-old Rolando Aarons earn a starting role. The Jamaican winger was named in a line-up dominated by new faces, including summer arrivals Jack Colback, Siem de Jong, and indeed Emmanuel Rivière. It was very pleasing to see manager Alan Pardew start the midfielder in such an encounter, an early indication of the intentions to finally bring through some youth on Tyneside.</description>

      <description>According to Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, Newcastle United have reached an agreement with Juventus over their Chilean full-back, Mauricio Isla. For many of you that watched the 2014 World Cup in-depth, you will have recognised his name, and more than likely, will know him from his endeavours with the Italian champions. The news breaks from a Chilean paper in a report which they claim Newcastle have agreed a $14m fee (£8m) for the 26 year-old and barring something spectacular, he will sign the dotted line on Tyneside in the coming days.</description>

      <description>While in my usual routine of browsing Twitter (@KevinDoocey if you&amp;rsquo;re not following!) I noticed a large number of Newcastle United fans detailing out their preferred starting eleven ahead of the upcoming Premier League season. Most people had a similar forward featuring the likes of Rémy Cabella, Siem de Jong and indeed Emmanuel Rivière. However, when it came to our midfield line-up, there were a few differences. What caught my eye was the quantity of people who had Jack Colback starting ahead of Vurnon Anita in a holding position.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have made a blistering start to the summer transfer market with 6 new quality signings. Mathieu Debuchy completed his long-awaited move to Arsenal on Thursday in a £12m move, as Newcastle announced his replacement, Daryl Janmaat, simultaneously. One World Cup finalist out, another one in. With the club have completed the signing of a much-needed creative midfielder in Siem de Jong and indeed Rémy Cabella - the attention now turns to a key striker.</description>

      <description>Finally, after several bouts of negotiation, it appears that Newcastle United have at last, agreed a deal for Montpellier&amp;rsquo;s Rémy Cabella. The Frenchman has been linked with a move to St. James&amp;rsquo; Park since last year, and this is not the first time that NUFC fans have been assured of a move, however, the difference this time, is that there are a number of reputable French sources claiming that the son of Montpellier owner Louis Nicollin, Laurent, has confirmed that the two sides have reached an agreement over the transfer of their key player.</description>

      <description>Back in January 2013 when Newcastle United completed the signing of Mathieu Debuchy from Lille in a £5m deal - I wondered how the club had pulled it off. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the fact that he had been linked with a switch to Newcastle for months previous but such a deal never materialised, nor was it the fact that player was eager to join. Even with all that going in the favour of NUFC, it still surprised me when he signed the dotted line at St.</description>

      <description>There is no doubt that the valuation of young England players with minimal Premier League experience has become somewhat of a joke in recent years. Luke Shaw - a fantastic talent with a huge future ahead of him no doubt - left Southampton for Manchester United in a £34m move, after just one season of proper Premier League football. Adam Lallana&amp;rsquo;s £25m price-tag which saw him join Liverpool has also been questioned by others, and although another very talented player, their respective costs are at least double their true value in a fair transfer market.</description>

      <description>In a rather turgid affair, Germany secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory over France to progress to the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup courtesy of a first half header from Mats Hummels. The Borussia Dortmund defender rose above Rafael Varane to brilliantly nod home the opening goal of the game, as France showed little fighting spirit to force their way back into the game. In turn, France&amp;rsquo;s exit sees Mathieu Debuchy and Moussa Sissoko return home to Newcastle, but for how long is the real question.</description>

      <description>Ever since Newcastle United completed the &amp;lsquo;coup&amp;rsquo; of Siem de Jong from Ajax, supporters are slowly but surely getting their hopes up for more signings in the very near future. Although the signing of de Jong cannot come as a major shock, the fashion in which the club sealed a 6 year-deal for the Dutch international did catch a lot of us by surprise as we did not assume that NUFC were in heavy discussions with that particular playmaker.</description>

      <description>It seems almost inevitable that Mathieu Debuchy was going to leave Newcastle United in the very near future, but today there seems to have been concrete movement on part of Arsenal to bring the French international to the Emirates. Debuchy&amp;rsquo;s future at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park had been under scrutiny since January following the departure of his best friend, and Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s best player, Yohan Cabaye, who left for Paris Saint Germain. While PSG are rumoured to be chasing Mathieu&amp;rsquo;s signature, Arsenal seem to be in pole position, and realistically represent a better deal for the 28 year-old who is currently preparing for the World Cup Quarter Final with France in Brazil.</description>

It was understood that Cabella had agreed personal terms with Newcastle and that a compromise has been reached between both sides regarding a fee, however; the midfielder was called up to France&amp;rsquo;s 2014 World Cup squad in Brazil after Franck Ribery was ruled out of the tournament.</description>

A Sunderland academy graduate, Colback has reportedly signed a lengthy deal with bitter rivals Newcastle, rebuffing Sunderland&amp;rsquo;s offer of a new and improved contract. Not only that, but the 24 year-old also turned down a staggering £50k a week to join West Ham, according to reputable sources in London.</description>

      <description>The infamous &amp;lsquo;line&amp;rsquo; everyone associated with Newcastle United talks about is yet again proving to be the club&amp;rsquo;s achilles heel in the quest to sign talented midfielder Rémy Cabella. The 23 year-old Frenchman has long been admired by the NUFC faithful including Graham Carr, and it was thought that he was all set for a January move to the club, only for both parties to scupper tentative negotiations headed by two questionable characters in Montpellier owner Louis Nicollin and indeed then NUFC DoF, Joe Kinnear.</description>

      <title>Are Newcastle wasting their time in Bafetimbi Gomis chase?</title>

      <description>Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s interest in Bafetimbi Gomis dates back before 2008 when the club looked to sign him before the European Championship however he eventually made the short move to Lyon, from St. Etienne. Fast forward six years and under much different management, Newcastle are still eager to bring him to Tyneside. Last summer&amp;rsquo;s transfer window saw the club come close to signing the Frenchman, but eventually the move fell apart due to a mixture of greed on part of Gomis&amp;rsquo; agents and indeed then Director of Football, Joe Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s inability to recognise the fashion in which the modern transfer market operates.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United are reportedly close to completing a deal for young Spanish striker Ayoze Perez from CD Tenerife for a fee of €2m. The 20 year-old was rumoured to have been on Tyneside the last couple of days finalising a lengthy contract at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park as NUFC look to kick-start their summer recruitment nice and early. I must say, I had not even heard of his name before this week so I cannot comment on what he might bring to the Newcastle setup, but in true Dennis Wise style, I watched his YouTube compilation clips and although he plays at a questionable level, some of his finishing was top notch — indeed very impressive if I may say so myself.</description>

      <description>News has emerged that Dan Gosling has agreed a deal to join Championship side Bournemouth in the coming weeks after four rather unsuccessful years on Tyneside. The midfielder arrived at Newcastle with high hopes having been tipped for big things by the Everton faithful, but through injury, various managerial changes, and a tough competition for places, Gosling has resigned himself to finding first team football elsewhere. I wrote about his arrival and how it could turn out to be a great signing on a free, but alas, he has not quite turned out the talented midfielder that I thought he had the potential to become.</description>

      <description>In a quite depressing statement released by Newcastle United officials at a recent Fans forum, the club confirmed in no uncertain terms that manager Alan Pardew will be staying on as head coach, much to the disappointment of 99% of NUFC fans, and indeed myself. I am not going to dwell on the points made at the forum, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t been told anything new. The club want stability in the Premier League, no real involvement in any of the Cups, and will continue to remain fixated on acquiring the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; type of player to suit the recruitment procedure.</description>

      <description>It was somewhat frustrating to see Newcastle United concede two goals in the space of 10 ten minutes from almost identical dead-ball situations. Steven Gerrard who as we all know can most certainly cross a ball, delivered two pin-point beauties to the far post which Daniel Agger and indeed Daniel Sturridge made no mistake in sticking away. It marked a disappointing second half, indeed a 90 minutes which summed up our entire season: first half great, second half awful.</description>

      <description>While any noise about potential arrivals on Tyneside may be welcomed by supporters, there are a few exceptions. Firstly, we want some decent talent at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park next season in order to compete with the teams above us. As we know, and have been told numerous times - there is plenty of cash in reserve at Newcastle United ready to be spent on the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; type of player. Unfortunately, Luuk de Jong is not that type of player.</description>

      <description>While Newcastle United prepare for their daunting trip to Anfield on Sunday, it is well reported that Mike Ashley will sit down with current manager Alan Pardew and thrash out details of how the 2013&amp;frasl;14 Premier League campaign unfolded. Many of the reputable news outlets are insistent that Pardew&amp;rsquo;s future will be under major review when this meeting takes place, and that more than likely he could relieved of his duties as manager.</description>

The Argentinian centre-back was widely expected to depart Tyneside for a return to his home nation, but all has been put to bed as the ball-playing defender announced to the Shields Gazette that he is already looking forward to the next campaign in a Newcastle jersey.</description>

      <description>It is true what they say: players have too much power in the modern game. Extravagant wages, greedy agents, and a sense of invincibility are aspects that one can attribute to many Premier League stars of the 21st century. Often one sees a manager sacked because a number of his players do not feel he is the correct manager for the club. David Moyes&amp;rsquo; recent departure from Manchester United was just one example of the majority of his squad failing to pull their weight throughout he season in order to have the Scot fired from his post.</description>

      <description>If you had told any Newcastle United fan in September that come the end of the month of April, 2014, Yohan Cabaye would be plying his football in France, and Dan Gosling would be his replacement in midfield, then I think there would be a few raised eyebrows. Unfortunately that is exactly how things have panned out at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. Mr. Gosling has made a dramatic return to the first team and on Monday night he started yet again in a midfield that might have as well stayed back on Tyneside as Arsenal romped to an easy three nil victory.</description>

At this stage in the season, all professional, well run clubs will be already eyeing up potential summer transfer targets ahead of the 2014&amp;frasl;15 campaign, and glances will have been cast towards squads currently in the bottom three.</description>

      <description>Few Newcastle United fans will forget Tim Krul&amp;rsquo;s European debut against Palermo in the old UEFA Cup. A team which featured the likes of Alberto Luque and Antoine Sibierski travelled to Italy with the hope of pulling off a memorable result and they did exactly that, with Tim Krul the sole reason behind the famous victory. At just 17 years of age, Krul replaced an injured Steve Harper between the sticks and made a name for himself by contributing a handful of physic-defying saves.</description>

      <description>If it was ever in doubt, Shola Ameobi all but confirmed that he is to leave Newcastle United when his contract runs out at the end of the season in a radio interview with BBC Newcastle. The Nigerian international scored the opener in Saturday&amp;rsquo;s defeat to Swansea City in what may prove to be his final ever goal in a Black and White jersey. Ameobi has been on the books at NUFC for a staggering 14 years, and I say staggering because in that time he failed to convince many that he actually is a striker.</description>

      <description>It seems almost a matter of hours before David Moyes is relieved of his duties as manager of Manchester United. The ex-Everton boss assumed control of the reigning Premier League champions following Alex Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s retirement last season, but the transition from Goodison Park to the supposed theatre of dreams has been quite a seamless as first hoped. League defeats to West Bromwich Albion, Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea, and indeed our very own Newcastle United have ensured that David Moyes tenure at MUFC is under major scrutiny, and it looks like the club&amp;rsquo;s owners has decided enough is enough.</description>

It makes for sad reading when I see a number of Newcastle United fans hoping that their team loses Saturday’s encounter with Swansea City in order to increase the pressure on manager Alan Pardew, with the hope of making his position increasingly untenable. The reality is, if Pardew can keep his job after ‘headbutting’ a Premier League footballer, then a dismal run of form while in the top half of the table is unlikely to have Mike Ashley drawing up contingency plans.</description>

      <description>It is just over a year since I last wrote about Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s corner woe, and unfortunately I return to lament the sheer lack of strategy at the club when it comes to the set-piece situation. The last corner that I can remember us directly scoring from was Loic Rémy&amp;rsquo;s 3rd minute opener against Hull City at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park back in September. Yohan Cabaye whipped in an enticing ball from the left hand corner-side which found its way through to Loic who slotted home as easy as you like.</description>

Romain Amalfitano, Haris Vuckic, Gael Bigirimana are just three faces that have failed to make the cut at Newcastle just yet, albeit Haris is on loan at Rotherham.</description>

The players looked clueless, disinterested and generally lazy throughout the 90+ minutes at St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s, and it&amp;rsquo;s not the first time such a performance has materialised. At home to Tottenham Hotspur - truth be told - a pretty awful Tottenham Hotspur showed up to stick four past Tim Krul in the Newcastle United goal and leave a packed out St.</description>

      <description>There may have been only a solitary point separating Newcastle United and Southampton in favour of the North East outfit before today, but when the final whistle sounded at a packed out St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Stadium - there might as well have been a division between the sides, as the difference in quality on display was truly visible. Southampton have earned the plaudits for their style of football this season, and as I alluded to in my preview on Friday evening, Newcastle needed to be on song in order to avoid another away defeat.</description>

Well today our own Newcastle United make the trek to Hampshire looking to extend the gap above Mauricio Pochettino&amp;rsquo;s men to four points. Alan Pardew - fresh from his three game stadium ban - will resume his duties from the posh-seats in the St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Stadium while assistant manager John Carver will be his man on the ground prowling the touchlines.</description>

      <description>First things first, how good was it to see Papiss Cissé end his barren spell in front of goal with a fine header in stoppage time against Crystal Palace on Saturday? The #9 took his chance remarkably well given previous guilt-edge efforts at goal in the previous 92 minutes, so let&amp;rsquo;s hope its the start of a scoring spree from the undoubtedly talented Senegalese forward. We are now entering the stage of the Premier League season when contenders for both the title and relegation emerge at opposite ends of the table.</description>

      <description>Many neutrals say that at Newcastle United, both successes and failures are exaggerated on Tyneside. Sadly enough, plenty of fans from across England believe the majority of Newcastle supporters expect a Champions League challenge each season, and a close run in the respective, domestic cups as well. While there are a minority of those fans who still believe that the club are capable of producing a campaign like that of Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s tenure at St.</description>

      <title>Does Kinnear’s resignation signal a victory for Alan Pardew?</title>

      <description>Finally there is a little good news on Tyneside. Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s Director of Football Joe Kinnear announced his &amp;lsquo;resignation&amp;rsquo; from his position at the club with immediate effect — just hours after Tyne Time delivered a verdict on the &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo; he had done so far. Of course it is likely that Kinnear resigned earlier that day, we&amp;rsquo;ll just all pretend that he read our article and decided it was time to go, OK?</description>

      <title>Time to judge Joe Kinnear – a verdict on the Irishman</title>

      <description>I think we all remember the day Joe Kinnear announced that he was to become Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s director of football. I heard the news and quickly assumed that his role was simply a &amp;lsquo;favour for a mate&amp;rsquo; to get the Irishman back into a paying job and help him live comfortably, granted by owner Mike Ashley. Kinnear managed Newcastle in an ill-fated season at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park in which the famous football club suffered relegation to the Coca Cola Championship (npower) and although it may be contrary to the vast opinion among Newcastle fans, I do believe that the ex-Tottenham Hotspur footballer would have kept the club in the Premier League should he have been able to stay on as manager.</description>

      <title>Newcastle United 0-3 SAFC: An honest review of the 2014 Tyne-Wear derby</title>

      <description>Awful. Atrocious. Abysmal. Appalling. Just four words to describe Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s performance against Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park today. Whatever about the &amp;lsquo;once-off&amp;rsquo; showing the lads put in against the very same outfit a year ago - today was on par, if not worse. I can only speak for myself when I say there was a little &amp;lsquo;something&amp;rsquo; missing from the build-up to the game, perhaps the disappointing transfer window dwindled the levels of optimism.</description>

      <description>As the transfer window ticks towards its conclusion, Newcastle fans are saying their goodbyes to Yohan Cabaye as the French midfield maestro seals a dream move to PSG. The fee in question for Yo is reportedly an initial £20m, with another £3m in add-ons based on performances and achievements. His move was inevitable and we wish him the best of luck with the French outfit, thankfully we do not have to face him in the Premier League any time soon.</description>

      <description>When Newcastle have trailed games, or even looked for that extra push to try win a game, it is always exciting to have players such as Hatem Ben Arfa on the bench raring to come on. Perhaps sometimes when Loic Rémy on his own up front is not working, Pardew usually opts to bring on Shola Ameobi for Vurnon Anita to hassle the opposition&amp;rsquo;s back four. Papiss Cissé is another man who has been introduced this season with the hope of grabbing a result against teams, but unfortunately some substitutions have worked out better than others.</description>

      <description>In mid January 2013 Newcastle United had a bid in the region of £8m accepted by Marseille for their star forward Loic Rémy. The Frenchman was due to travel to Tyneside to complete the move but in the space of a day he had signed the dotted line in London, for Queens Park Rangers. The ex-Lens man didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother making the journey to Newcastle and instead opted to sign for the struggling Premier League outfit managed by Harry Redknapp, after a game of FIFA with the club owner Tony Fernandes.</description>

      <description>When Yoan Gouffran was linked with a move to Newcastle United this time last year, the most bizarre rumour appeared about the Frenchman. Reports from France suggested that Gouffran was allergic to grass, which worried some Newcastle fans. Later we all found out that he is allergic to certain species of trees and not grass, otherwise how would he have become a successful, professional footballer?! In January of 2013 Newcastle parted with £600,000 to land the Bordeaux forward who had impressed Alan Pardew in his performance against the Magpies in a Europa League group stage game and also happened to be in the final six months of his contract at the French club.</description>

      <description>After half an hour of Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s tie against West Ham in the Premier League last Saturday, it was absolutely clear the quality of a midfielder that the club have in Yohan Cabaye. When The Frenchman was linked with a move away in the summer some Newcastle fans played down his real ability, and dubbed him as a &amp;lsquo;good player&amp;rsquo; but &amp;lsquo;not great&amp;rsquo;, and certainly not European quality. I argued that he was one of the finest midfielders in Europe when on form and in turn asked some of the doubters why the likes of PSG and Arsenal were looking into signing him if he was - as they said - just a &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; midfielder.</description>

      <description>There has been few home debuts more memorable that Moussa Sissoko&amp;rsquo;s against Chelsea in February 2013. Jonas Gutierrez had given NUFC a first half lead but two stunning goals from Frank Lampard and Juan Mata turned the tie in favour of the Blues. Then came Moussa to the rescue. A quick break from midfield set Yoan Gouffran behind the back four and he tried his luck with a strong left-footed effort that Petr Cech could only parry perfectly into the path of Sissoko to tap into an empty net.</description>

      <description>Cheick Tioté is one of a handful of Newcastle United players that have really turned on the style this season. Mike Williamson resembles an established Premier League defender nowadays while Vurnon Anita has fast become one of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s most important players. Cast your mind back to last season and Cheick Tioté was an infuriating player to watch. Actually, turn your thoughts to the first few games of the season and Tioté looked out of his depth in England&amp;rsquo;s top division.</description>

      <description>As many of you will know and are probably tired of me pointing out (!) I am a big fan of &amp;lt;Vurnon Anita and his style of play. Many Newcastle fans were quick to play down his potential when he arrived from Ajax in 2012 for £7m, but from the few performances he put in it was clear - to me at least - that this guy is a technically astute player.</description>

      <description>Current Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho once told reporters that one of his few regrets during his time at Inter Milan was his decision to let Davide Santon leave. The young Italian joined Newcastle United in August 2011 for a fee of £5m, and has fast become a important starter in the NUFC team. His attacking ability and technical awareness made him an ideal full-back to recruit, and replaced Jose Enrique aptly.</description>

      <description>To this very day of writing, Fabricio Coloccini remains Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s most expensive signing. The club parted with £10.3m for the composed Argentine and just six months later it looked like he had the makings of another Jean Alain-Boumsong or Titus Bramble. Coloccini&amp;rsquo;s lack of pace saw him vulnerable in his debut season and as we all know, the club eventually succumbed to dreaded relegation in 2009. Despite that, down to a mixture of the club being unable to sell him and Fabricio&amp;rsquo;s sense of underachievement the bushy haired South American stayed with the club in the Championship.</description>

      <description>Revert your thoughts to this time last year. Newcastle United fans across the world grimaced when the ball went anywhere near Mike Williamson. The centre-back portrayed a lumbering figure, bereft of confidence and limited in ability. I personally remember worrying about Loic Rémy facing Williamson in our crucial fixture against Queens Park Rangers towards the end of last season which secured our Premier League safety. Rémy had already struck away a penalty earlier in the game and Newcastle had regressed into their defensive shape which almost cost the club its league status.</description>

      <description>Mathieu Debuchy was a player that Newcastle had tried to bring to St. James&amp;rsquo; Park before the 2012 European Championship. Just a few minutes into the illustrious footballing tournament is was easy to see why. In the right-back position for France Mathieu was quick, well versed tactically and loved to get forward from right-back to aid his teammates — an ideal candidate for the Premier League. Against England Debuchy performed admirably and his good form continued throughout the rest of the tournament until the French were eliminated in the last 16 by eventual champions, Spain.</description>

      <description>It it easy to quickly move on to the coming Premier League fixtures and focus on the future as a football fan, but sometimes looking back can yield some interesting and often crucial analysis which can help benefit future performances. Managers across the world usually re-watch entire game footage to point out areas which need improvement in future fixtures and this applies to many team sports. As a Newcastle United fan, I thought it might be useful to look at each individual player that has donned a Black and White shirt this season so far and give them a sort of &amp;lsquo;Midterm Report&amp;rsquo; as I like to call it.</description>

      <description>Usually when Newcastle United go about their business in the transfer window it is done in an efficient, often professional manner with little information leaked to the media by sources at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park. Over the last two years Graham Carr has spearheaded a large recruitment drive that has seen over 10 players of French nationality arrive at Newcastle. When Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s side signed so many French, and no fewer than five in the January transfer window a year ago this month, people questioned whether it would work.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United travel to West Ham to take on Sam Allardyce&amp;rsquo;s men in a tie that could see the Magpies extend the gap from their table rivals Southampton with Mauricio Pochettino&amp;rsquo;s side having only draw against Sunderland in the early kick-off. NUFC are on a poorish run of form with four losses, but such defeats included ties against Arsenal and Manchester City — two games that were very much in the balance till the dying moments, and one hindered by a disgraceful refereeing decision at a pivotal point of the game.</description>

      <description>Having crashed out the FA Cup in abysmal fashion it seems quite convenient for the Newcastle hierarchy to leak out news of potential January transfer signings. Of course when you fall out the cup so early at home to a struggling Welsh side you want to draw the attention away from it as quickly as possible so why not throw the media some news about the possibility of as many as four new signings in January?</description>

Anyway, Tyne Time will show the news for what it is and it looks as if Cabaye is heading to France for one reason of another, his latest &amp;lsquo;injury&amp;rsquo; adding to claims that the talented midfielder may well be looking to secure a move away from St.</description>

      <description>News emerging from France (where else?!) suggest that Newcastle United director of football Joe Kinnear may not actually be drinking whiskey and relaxing beside the fire this Christmas period, rather instead, lining up moves for January targets. France Football is carrying a story claiming NUFC have tabled an offer for young French defender Nathan Dekoké. The 17 year-old is currently on the books of Saint Étienne but his contract expires in the summer of 2014 meaning he is open to offers.</description>

Fast-forward to 2013 and the story has changed somewhat; Palace are in the Premier League, however Taylor - despite being injured - is one of many Newcastle players that played that day, that still happen to be on the books at the club; Fabricio Coloccini, Steven Taylor, Jonas Gutierrez and Shola Ameobi the others.</description>

      <description>A trip to Old Trafford is always a daunting task, and more often than not teams leave with little or no points - never mind all three. The last time the travelling Magpies made the trip down to Manchester to face what was then Alex Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s side in the Premier League - Javier Hernandez proved the thorn in the Magpies&amp;rsquo; side as the Mexican scored at the death to secure all three points in a thrilling 4-3 fixture.</description>

      <title>November to Christmas will define Alan Pardew’s tactical prowess</title>

      <description>Tactical awareness is not something most Newcastle supporters will attribute to Alan Pardew and rightly so. Some of the decisions the 52 year-old has made over the course of the last two seasons have left the majority - including myself - bemused. Regressive tactics, alongside some bizarre comments about his side&amp;rsquo;s style of play would pose the question whether Pardew is completely out of his depth in the Newcastle United hot-seat.</description>

      <description>There has been quite a bit of talk about Newcastle manager Alan Pardew and his team selection tonight. At the time of writing, his starting eleven not been confirmed but plenty of rumours exist of his tactical possibilities. More worryingly, there are suggestions that Vurnon Anita will be dropped from his starting role in order to make room for Cheick Tiote aka the yellow card machine. Tioté has been resigned to the bench for the past three games and is reportedly &amp;lsquo;shocked&amp;rsquo; to find himself in the dugout.</description>

      <description>The general mood among Newcastle United fans is one of pessimism, anxiety, and anger. The failure to add any solid signings to the squad makes Joe Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s appointment as director of football look like a farce. Mind you, it would not be the first time one labelled it exactly that. One day we&amp;rsquo;re after Bafetimbi Gomis, the next Kinnear is watching Belgium take on France in an international friendly. More importantly, besides an injured Loic Remy, we will head to Manchester City for our first game of the season with smaller squad than we finished last season with.</description>

      <description>Loic Rémy has officially arrived at Newcastle United to complete a medical ahead of a season-long loan with the option of buying the Frenchman at any point. The deal will mark Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s first major transfer achievement, although many would argue that loaning a player from the Championship is not big feat. Despite the overhanging court case - this move represents smart business from Newcastle United and Rémy is rather versatile, he can player either up front or on the wings.</description>

      <description>I remember when Newcastle United were chasing Bafetimbi Gomis almost five years this summer. Apparently he was available for £9m, and we were in with a good chance of landing him before the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Instead, he moved to Lyon who this year, are doing their utmost to get rid of the Frenchman. Talks between NUFC and Lyon have gone on for weeks, and it finally seems that there is light at the end of the tunnel with the French club&amp;rsquo;s president confirming that a fee had been agreed, and the player had agreed a contract.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s Portuguese pre-season tour seems to have went pretty well in terms of preparation for the upcoming season if a whole host of Northern journalists are to be believed. Fitness levels are extremely high - a result of four hour long training sessions led by Alan Pardew in relative heat, while there seems to be a stern and focused mentality. Such results offer immense encouragement to Newcastle United fans who have grown tired of countless transfer rumours, and little end product, as of yet.</description>

Above is supposedly part of a published catalogue of Puma&amp;rsquo;s 2013&amp;frasl;14 releases for the forthcoming season. Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s away jersey was confirmed a little over three weeks ago, greeted by mixed reaction, but generally everyone seems to agree that it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as bad as once anticipated. In the picture above, you can see both Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s home jersey for the 2013&amp;frasl;14 Premier League seasons accompanied the released away shirt.</description>

      <description>There has been very little transfer news about Newcastle United in the last few days. The only real story is our interest in PSV’s young Dutch keeper Jeroen Zoet – nothing to do with the first team, more so the development squad and the ongoing recruitment drive for young players that could have big futures ahead of them. Alan Pardew has admitted his interest in Aston Villa’s Darren Bent, and indeed Loic Remy of Queens Park Rangers and I suppose that is a start – we know who exactly the manager wants.</description>

      <description>There are quite a few reports swindling around regards Scott Sinclair and Newcastle United. A certain bookmaker have confirmed that the odds on Scott Sinclair heading to Newcastle United as his next club has been slashed from 20&amp;frasl;1 to an odds on of 1&amp;frasl;4 - meaning that a rather serious amount of money has been placed on the ex-Swansea man being a NUFC player for the coming season. I&amp;rsquo;m almost positive that such betting does not count for loan deals either - permanent moves only.</description>

      <description>It hardly came as surprising news when we learned that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opted to join Jurgen Klopp&amp;rsquo;s Borussia Dortmund. The lure of Champions League football - a requirement which his representatives set in stone ahead of any potential move - was enough to bring him to Germany. Of course, in fairness, there&amp;rsquo;s not too many players in Europe that would opt for a move to Tyneside ahead of Borussia, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest.</description>

      <description>Not too many will forget Joe Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s talkSPORT interview just a few weeks ago. His mispronunciation of a trio of Newcastle United players caused a stir in the media, and if believed - amongst Yohan, Hatem, and indeed Sammy too. He concluded his interview with a needless insult seemingly aimed at the fans, claiming he withholds a level of intelligence far superior than the majority of NUFC fans, although his inability to pronounce the names of some of the players would argue otherwise.</description>

      <description>From reading across Twitter and various other Newcastle United blogs, its seems like there is a general consensus that Alan Pardew needs to spend big in order to help the club finish in the Top 10 next season. I have heard of cries for Wilfried Bony, Tom Ince, Loic Remy, Stephane Mbia, Victor Wanyama, Gary Hooper and even Shaun Maloney (Seriously?) but the truth is, we do not need to go out and throw millions at clubs.</description>

      <description>Constant excuses and backward tactics are annoying to put up with in any sport, but at Newcastle United, we had to get used to it for about 30 games of the season. From pushing referees, goading opposition managers to a passionate and heartfelt embrace with Newcastle fans after Papiss Cissé fired in a 94th minute winner; Alan Pardew experienced quite a third season managing the biggest club in the north-east. Then came the derby defeat, a terrible performance summed up by a wonder goal from David Vaughan, his first and only goal of the season if I remember correctly.</description>

      <description>It has been a tough season at Newcastle United. Flirting with relegation, battling reports of a dressing-room split, losing in record fashion at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park, and having to watch long ball dross for much of the season. I know how it feels — supporting Newcastle United is not good for your health. So, since we&amp;rsquo;ve had a tough season and like myself, I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you are already looking forward to next season; a new start, a new chance, perhaps even a new manager - the next 48 hours will determine that one.</description>

      <description>Thankfully Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s win at QPR means fans of the club can already look forward to the summer transfer window with a certain relief, knowing that we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to go out and buy some proper players to strengthen the squad. Five players were recruited in January, one of which scored the all-important goal to keep us in the division, Yoan Gouffran. However, there is likely to be a couple of departures in the Newcastle team, with Cabaye sought after and tentative enquiries made for a certain Fabricio Coloccini as well.</description>

      <description>Back at the start of December 2012, a couple of days after Newcastle United had fielded a side with Nile Ranger up front away at Bordeaux in the Europa League, a survey was carried out. The question was simple, is Alan Pardew the man to bring Newcastle United forward as a club? 95% of voters claimed he was. Fast forward five months and NUFC have staved off the threat of relegation, just about.</description>

Goals from Hatem Ben Arfa and Yoann Gouffran helped Newcastle United to a 2-1 win over QPR and in effect, secure our status as a Premier League club for another season.</description>

      <description>If you told any neutral across Great Britain that Sunderland would romp to a three nil victory at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park on Sunday many would have laughed off the suggestion. However, when David Vaughan popped in a ridiculous effort from the edge of the area, you just knew that it was one of those days. High up in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park, the travelling Mackems could hardly believe their eyes, a three nil victory away at their fiercest rivals.</description>

      <description>It will take some time for Newcastle United fans to forget that 91st minute goal Benfica&amp;rsquo;s Salvio tapped home to well and truly end our European escapade. The moment the ball hit the net the home faithful put their head in their hands and a sense of realisation set in. Having dominated the most important period of the game and pressured the Benfica back four almost in submission, we just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find that elusive second goal.</description>

Having dispatched of the Greek outfit at home, we were then handed a hardish group but excelled when we needed to without flexing our muscles that much. Then came Metalist Kharkiv which Shola decided to sort out in Ukraine on his own.</description>

      <description>I remember the day Dan Gosling arrived at Newcastle United. We had managed to secure him on a free transfer from Everton after the Merseyside outfit failed to negotiate a new contract. Gosling arrived with potential, a decent passing range and even the odd goal - who can forget his 120th minute winner against Liverpool in the cup only a few years ago?! However since his arrival, injuries have hampered every opportunity he managed to get.</description>

      <description>When Massadio Haidara darted in from the wing and was tackled by Callum McManaman, you could hear a roar of pain from the Frenchman as soon as they collided. Any football fan watching knew something serious had happened, because as much diving that exists in the modern game, few &amp;lsquo;simulators&amp;rsquo; will wince in such pain to gain a free kick. Such a reaction was natural, and that was proven when the new LB was stretchered off with a serious looking injury.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s delivery from corners has become something of a joke. As we highlighted after our 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on the 2nd of September (just three games into the EPL season). Still, we are in the first week of January 2013, and Newcastle United are yet to still pose any decent threat from a corner. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s defeat to Swansea was a bitter pill to swallow considering we were much the better side overall, and controlled possession for the majority of the game which deserves credit, however, this article is not going to discuss our defeat to Swansea, you can find plenty of match reports out there.</description>

      <description>As most of might have expected, Metalist Kharkiv proved a pretty tricky test with Shola Ameobi settling the tie with a second leg penalty half an hour before full-time. There had been plenty talk about extra time and penalties up until KO, and it looked very much as if such predictions were not too far off the mark. However, Shola stepped up to brilliantly slot away yet another European goal for himself, and ensure a last 16 tie against Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala.</description>

      <description>One would almost forget about Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s European campaign as Pardew&amp;rsquo;s men attempt to stave off the threat of relegation, but on Thursday, Ukranian outfit Metalist Kharkiv visit St.James&amp;rsquo; Park in first leg of the knockout phases of the Europa League. Metalist have been on vacation following a winter break and their European adventure is likely to be a priority for them as they sit snug in fourth spot in their domestic league.</description>

      <description>When Adam le Fondre smashed home his second goal of the game at a bitter St.James&amp;rsquo; Park, a cold, hard realisation reverberated all the way from the Milburn Stand to the desks of Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy. NUFC were sinking, and well and truly mired in a relegation battle for the second time in four years. Something needed to be done about it, the same mistakes made in 2009 could not be repeated in 2013.</description>

      <description>When Newcastle United began the 2012&amp;frasl;13 Premier League campaign, the world &amp;lsquo;relegation&amp;rsquo; would not have existed in the same sentence. As we near the half way mark of January 2013, every single tabloid, broadsheet and blog is talking about the real possibility of Newcastle United finding themselves in the bottom three of the Premier League come May. With Demba Ba - NUFC&amp;rsquo;s leading goalscorer - departing for Chelsea, and the well documented unhappiness of captain Fabricio Coloccini all coming to the fore at the start of the New Year, Alan Pardew has a job on his hands and just about enough time to do it.</description>

      <description>First and foremost, a very Happy New Year to all of you, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it proves a fruitful one.
A pretty ridiculous Christmas period has come to an end, and the cold hard truth is that Newcastle United need to start 2013 with a handful of wins to guarantee a respectable Premier League finish. Our trip to Manchester reminded me of something in 2002, when NUFC were in touching distance of Manchester United and an actual threat to Alex Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>With the talk of Marseille&amp;rsquo;s Loïc Rémy joining Newcastle United in a £10m deal, it is also suggested that one of our French squad members will also sides as part of the agreement. It is rumoured that Sylvain Marveaux maybe the man leaving Tyneside, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m the only one that would be extremely disappointed by his departure. Marveaux arrived on a free transfer from Rennes over a year ago and has slowly but surely established himself at NUFC.</description>

      <description>Much can be said about Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s current form. Uninspiring, insufficient, immature: the list goes on. However, while some people may argue that we are looking like a team destined for relegation, others will argue that such a lamentable lapse in form is normal, and was a matter of time before we endured a period of defeats. You see, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get used to winning. Losing, not so much. Last season Newcastle United went on a shuddering streak of form, beating almost everyone in front of them at certain stages of the season.</description>

      <description>Pardew - Tactical inefficiency costing Newcastle United for 3rd game running As I am sure you know by now if you have read my blog for any considerable length of time; I&amp;rsquo;m probably one of the most optimistic Newcastle United supporters you&amp;rsquo;ll met. Optimistic, not unrealistic. However, today&amp;rsquo;s performance away at newly promoted Southampton was nothing less than depressing even for the most hopeful of us. We were truly atrocious.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of Newcastle United fans overreacting right now, following a disappointing defeat to West Ham United. However, to say that Newcastle United performed quite miserably today would be a slight understatement. Up against old boys Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll, it was almost written in the script that one of them would net against us, but to grab the three points is another matter.
In quite a sluggish first half, neither side showed much ambition to be fair.</description>

      <description>Unlike many years previous, Newcastle United have a very strong midfield contingent on the books. From Yohan Cabaye as far down to Dan Gosling we happen to have a little bit of depth, but of course this should not, and will not stop Graham Carr from compiling reports on potential signings. The latest man on the list is 23 year-old Moussa Sissoko, of Toulouse. Apparently his contract allows teams to engage in pre-contract negotiations so needless to say, Newcastle United have been sniffing around.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United will tomorrow take on a West Brom side looking to add to their already impressive points tally of 14, following a summer of changes at the Hawthorns. In their last outing at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park; Roy Hodgson led his side to a 2-3 win, despite the best efforts of Demba Ba who scored a brace that night. Hodgson as we know, is now England manager and Steve Clarke, formerly of Chelsea, has taken the reins at the Midlands club.</description>

      <description>Wonga - Providing the youth academy and city in general with generous funding Rarely do many media outlets down South write anything relatively warming about Newcastle United as a football club. Through the turmoil, various papers churned out demeaning and arrogant articles about the state of the brilliant club that is, NUFC. Mike Ashley, who to be fair has sanctioned his fair share of dreadful decisions during his tenure as owner, has been criticised for almost every decision he has made in recent times.</description>

      <description>If you were to believe everything in the papers, Demba Ba would have left NUFC in January 2012, then again in the summer and now he&amp;rsquo;ll be set for his third departure in the New Year. As well as that, we&amp;rsquo;d have been left with Cheick Tioté, Papiss Cissé, Yohan Cabaye, Tim Krul and even Fabricio Coloccini. Sadly, it has come to a stage where it is no longer funny, or even maddening - quite frankly because papers (particularly tabloids) are so desperate for a headline, that they&amp;rsquo;ll regurgitate any old nonsense just to sell a few stacks.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s usually no better feeling in football than scoring in the dying seconds to achieve a result that looked virtually impossible. When Victor Anichebe powered home Everton&amp;rsquo;s second goal, it looked as if they were on course to take a deserved three points on an emotional night at Goodison. Unfortunately for Moyes&amp;rsquo; men, they hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the script. The other substitute of the night, Demba Ba, wasn&amp;rsquo;t finished just and thanks to a chest-on from Shola Ameobi - the Senegalese man prodded home a priceless equaliser to make it 2-2.</description>

He notched up double figures in Black and White despite only arriving at the end of the season and almost all his goals oozed utter class.</description>

However, I did see Ciaran Clarke&amp;rsquo;s opener and quite a few passages of NUFC&amp;rsquo;s play which was below par to say the least.</description>

      <description>Cissé - Scoring that goal on his debut to secure an important win for NUFC With Cheick Tioté ruled out of tomorrows encounter with Aston Villa, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth a look at how we might line-up especially, without our key African in midfield. His absence against Chelsea was obvious as we were overrun in midfield time and time again, despite the best efforts of new boy Vurnon Anita who did as well as could be expected considering the circumstances.</description>

NUFC&amp;rsquo;s first ever bid for the French international was somewhere in the region of £4m, and was indeed deemed insufficient. Since then - more than a month later - we haven&amp;rsquo;t made any apparent progress with a deal.

      <description>#### Rémy - A long term target of Newcastle United dating back to that 2009 season
It seems as if Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s attempts to lure Andy Carroll back to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park for a fee in the region of £15m has reached an impasse. Brendan Rodgers has today commented that nothing less than £20m will give any prospective clubs the chance to talk to Carroll, with the price tag a tad too high for Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s liking.</description>

      <description>#### Douglas - In high demand but Newcastle United lead the race for the Brazilian
During Sam Allardyce&amp;rsquo;s tenure at Newcastle United, he signed Alan Smith, Mark Viduka, Claudio Cacapa, and Joey Barton name a few. To say those signings turned out to be quite disappointing acquisitions - Jose Enrique aside - would be putting it very mildly indeed. Now however, Allardyce seems to be taking his targets from Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s scrapbook.</description>

      <description>#### Xisco - Clearly not in Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s plans for the 2012&amp;frasl;13 Premier League season
There aren&amp;rsquo;t many cases stranger than Xisco&amp;rsquo;s career at Newcastle United.
The Spanish forward signed from Deportivo, on Dennis Wise&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, for a reported fee of £5.75m in the autumn of 2008. Shortly after he signed for NUFC, our manager at the time - Kevin Keegan - resigned after another player had been brought in, without him having much of a say in the matter.</description>

      <description>#### Carroll - Wants to come home and his return is a a real possibility
Some things are just perfect. Selling a guy to Liverpool for £35m after only playing three-quarters of a Premier League season, and then finishing above them in the league with their new signing having very little impact, is probably as close as perfect can get when it comes to football. The cherry on top of it all sees Newcastle United coming back in for Carroll in a cut price deal and the player himself, refusing to talk to any other club other than his homeland team.</description>

      <description>#### Cabaye - Worth £20m at the very least and has no intentions of leaving NUFC
There has been some typically bad journalism from the Daily Mail in the last few years regarding Newcastle United, but they&amp;rsquo;ve certainly topped this years efforts with the latest rumour. Today, they linked Yohan Cabaye to Barcelona - for a fee of £8m. First off, why would Barcelona need more midfielders with the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets and countless others in their ranks, including all their young prospects that will gradually make a move up to the first team.</description>

      <description>Before Newcastle United completed the free transfer of Demba Ba, they tried their utmost to lure Kevin Gameiro from FC Lorient. However, PSG showed an interest and ended up signing him. As we all know, the Parisian side were bought over by a rich tycoon and since have done a bit of a &amp;lsquo;Man City&amp;rsquo; on their domestic league, and have bought up a lot of quality players. The likes of Pastore came first, and this summer, Napoli&amp;rsquo;s Ezequiel Lavezzi joined the French side.</description>

Not many people might have realised, but our £11m bid deemed unacceptable by FC Twente, for their star man Luuk de Jong, happened to be the highest ever bid Mike Ashley has financed in his NUFC tenure thus far. When Ashley arrived on Tyneside, he immediately threw forward £10.3m to sign Fabricio Coloccini - a well spent ten million if you ask me.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s some good news emerging regarding Newcastle United target Junior Hoilett. As of tonight, it is understood that Hoilett&amp;rsquo;s contract will officially expire and NUFC are reported to be making their move for the winger. Unless you hid under a stone for the entire Premier League season that has just passed us, then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that Hoilett had a decent season, and scored some great goals for a team that eventually surrendered to relegation.</description>

While Newcastle United are trying their hardest to bring Luuk de Jong to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park, they have told FC Twente&amp;rsquo;s negotiators that if they are too greedy over their forward, then the North-East outfit won&amp;rsquo;t think twice about pulling out of any deal. Derek Llambias, alongside Lee Charnley are present in Holland and are hoping to take a trip down to France to talk to their other main target Mathieu Debuchy (if he isn&amp;rsquo;t holidaying already!</description>

The latest update in the Luuk de Jong situation is that we have a delegation over in the Netherlands to hopefully agree a fee for the forward and begin contract negotiations - before the striker makes a Europa League performance and inevitably, deem him ineligible for European action in a NUFC shirt.</description>

Astoundingly, this summer&amp;rsquo;s transfer window could see Newcastle United spending upwards of £20m as their pursuit of FC Twente forward Luuk de Jong, and endeavours to sign Mathieu Debuchy continue. de Jong, who has been subject to a £8.5m bid from NUFC would welcome a move to the Premier League, however, his club would like to receive a fee closer to £10m before letting their star man go.</description>

Indeed, before the start of the European Championships, Pardew made quite an effort to seal a deal for Mathieu Debuchy and wanted Poland &amp;amp; Ukraine to be a warmup for his pre-season campaign with the Magpies.</description>

It is fair to say that Newcastle United fans have had to put up with a lot of slack from Sunderland fans in the last couple of years.

The latest name to be linked with us is a certain Henri Bedimo, from Ligue 1 champions Montpellier.</description>

In the last few minutes,SkySports have reported on a bit of Newcastle United transfer news. There are claims that Newcastle United have submitted an official bid in the region of £8m for FC Twente&amp;rsquo;s Luuk de Jong - signalling that Demba Ba could be very close to departing St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. Either that, or NUFC are actually closing in on a deal for someone we don&amp;rsquo;t know about, and the de Jong rumours are simply a smokescreen for the deal.</description>

SkySports here in the UK however, have official confirmation from Newcastle United FC that no bids have been received for the Senegalese international.</description>

A report in the Journal by widely respected journalist Mark Douglas has revealed that Mathieu Debuchy - one of Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s number one targets this summer - fancies a move to Newcastle, and is ready to shun interest from the likes of Inter Milan to complete a move to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. Debuchy, who was arguably the best player on the park when France drew 1-1 with England a few days ago at Euro 2012, is catching the eye of a lot of other clubs in Europe, and there&amp;rsquo;s even talk that Arsenal might be interested as well.</description>

If this is the case, then I&amp;rsquo;m sure the NUFC hierarchy will only laugh off the bid and tell Harry that Timmy&amp;rsquo;s left hand isn&amp;rsquo;t for sale. £10m?! For one of the keepers of the season - in a side that finished just off the Champions League spots - ten million wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cover half the keepers fee.</description>

The first 11 include injured players, and indeed players that aren&amp;rsquo;t even in the squad - so this is a team we would have selected before all the injuries occurred.</description>

Rosales, a Venezuelan international since 2007, is twenty-three years of age and an exciting prospect at the Dutch club. Of course we have done quite well with our last signing from this side in the shape of Cheik Tioté for about £3.</description>

      <description>#### Amalfitano - Has signed for Newcastle United but won&amp;rsquo;t move until July 1st
Newcastle United in the last few minutes have confirmed that the club have signed Romain Amalfitano and he will join from Reims when his contract expires on June 30th. The club tweeted the news in the last few seconds, and it finally brings a close to the speculation. A deal was practically done two days ago as we reported, but now, it is official.</description>

      <description>James - Newcastle United building for the future and looking towards English While Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s transfer focus revolves around a certain Romain Amalfitano and his imminent move to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park, SkySports are reporting that Luke James, of Hartlepool is subject to an approach from the North East&amp;rsquo;s biggest club. James, at just 17 years old has burst on to the scene in League 1 - or apparently so - and NUFC alongside relegated Bolton, and Scottish champions Celtic chase his signature.</description>

      <description>#### Ranger - Lot of raw potential but a poor attitude to accompany it
If one was to look at Nile Ranger&amp;rsquo;s CV, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make for bad reading at all. Once of Southampton, he featured in Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s promotion to the Premier League, and this year contributed to Sheffield Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s return to the Championship. Unfortunately he has the attitude of a gangster and is still surrounded by people he could do without.</description>

      <description>#### Davies - Very talented football that would be a snip at anything under £4m
There has been a lot of talk in the last week or so of Mark Davies joining Newcastle United from Bolton Wanderers. With Bolton relegated to the nPower Championship, Owen Coyle will face a battle to try keep his best players, and although he has managed to sign Kevin Davies to a new deal - the likes of Mark Davies will have Premier League ambitions.</description>

      <description>#### Tasci - 25 year old German centre-back held in high regard
Reports today are suggesting that VfB Stuttgart defender Serdar Tasci has turned down approaches from Newcastle United, and indeed Spurs. The German - 25 years-old - is just recovering from an sprained knee ligaments and it seems as if he has a transfer clause in his contract allowing him to leave for a predetermined fee, a fee which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been revealed.</description>

      <description>#### Smith - An extremely disappointing signing for NUFC to say the very least
I remember the day we signed Alan Smith quite well, the start of August 2007 - another &amp;lsquo;coup&amp;rsquo; by Allardyce, or seemingly so. He arrived for £6m, a decent fee to pay for someone who was just returning from a serious injury. Pay for it we did. After signing a 5 and a half year deal at a modest £60,000 a week, Smith has never had a grip on the first team and at the end of June he will depart Newcastle United on a free transfer.</description>

      <description>Amalfitano - Is expected to arrive at St.James&amp;rsquo; in the coming days With Danny Guthrie set for a move away from Newcastle United, Alan Pardew and the club hierarchy are just waiting to announce the signing of Romain Amalfitano. Graham Carr and co. have spotted what they think might be the next gem to emerge from France, for a minimal fee - a few hundred thousand even. Although the Reims midfielder has been tight lipped over any potential move away from France, it is understood, and according to L&amp;rsquo;Equipe that the deal is indeed done, and that he&amp;rsquo;ll be announced as a Newcastle United player possibly in the coming days, or in the next few weeks.</description>

      <description>Benny - Making the French squad a testament to his work since the horrid broken leg NUFC players heading to a major tournament? World Cup 2010, Jonas Gutierrez featured for Argentina, was there anyone else in South Africa on Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s books? Euro 2008? Can&amp;rsquo;t say I remember anyone representing NUFC at the tournament. This year however, Hatem Ben Arfa, Yohan Cabaye and Tim Krul look likely to go. For a European championship, that is a pretty impressive showing, and a testament to Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s fantastic season; especially when two of the three are part of a potential Euro 2012 winning team, in France.</description>

      <description>#### Clyne - In high demand with Manchester United looking to poach the youngster
It is all very much paper talk at the moment surrounding Newcastle United and their proposed transfer targets, however, it is understood that Alan Pardew has made tentative inquiries about the availability of Crystal Palace right-back Nathaniel Clyne. At just 21 years of age, English, and with a lot of potential - Clyne is as expected very much sought after, but by Newcastle above all else.</description>

      <description>N&amp;rsquo;Zonzi - A whole host of clubs track the midfielder after Blackburn&amp;rsquo;s relegation As would expect, a lot of Blackburn Rovers players are interesting clubs in the Premier League following their relegation to the nPower Championship. Junior Hoilett, Mauro Formica, Yakubu, and now Steven N&amp;rsquo;Zonzi are all thought to be leaving Ewood Park this summer. N&amp;rsquo;Zonzi is now, apparently, a target for Alan Pardew and Newcastle United. By trade, N&amp;rsquo;Zonzi a defensive midfielder so he would probably provide back-up to Cheik Tioté when he suffers inevitable suspensions next season , or indeed provide cover for the Ivorian when the Europa League kicks off.</description>

The centre midfielder, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t managed a consistent role in the midfield this season is eager to play week in week out, and unfortunately, that isn&amp;rsquo;t going to happen at Newcastle United.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have today announced their change strip for the upcoming 2012&amp;frasl;13 season - as well as released the goalkeepers shirt which is less desirable than the jersey pictured above.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much we&amp;rsquo;ll use the change kit, perhaps away to Spurs, and Fulham again next season but not a whole lot. Either way, here&amp;rsquo;s a look at them:

Who is that you might ask, and to be fair, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard a lot about him before. What we do know is that he is 19 year-old Swedish striker for club Joenkoeping Soedra.</description>

      <description>Ben Arfa - It only takes a few moments from this guy to change a game  Heading to Stamford Bridge in the past has been a daunting task no doubt, but of recent times we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed quite a decent spell in the Blue side of London. Last season Shola Ameobi and even Nile Ranger scored in a Newcastle United win in the Carling Cup, and towards the very end of the Premier League season - Steven Taylor popped up with an injury time header to snatch a dramatic last-minute point to send the traveling Geordies into raptures.</description>

With Hatem Ben Arfa, Demba Ba and Papiss Cissé leading Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s attack in recent weeks it must make Gabriel Obertan&amp;rsquo;s comeback from injury that bit harder. The winger signed from Manchester United for £3m played quite regularly at the start of the season, as Hatem gradually got back to full fitness. However, a few niggles and annoying injuries have kept Gabby out for a month or so, the sad thing being no one has really missed him.</description>

Opening &amp;amp; closing the scoring, with a routine Papiss Cissé goal inbetween - Cabaye sent Newcastle United into 4th spot in the Premier League. It was all NUFC from the first whistle, and after 13 minutes a bit of brilliance from Ben Arfa out on the wing helped the ball into Cissé who hit the bar - only for Cabaye to follow-up and nod it in.</description>

      <description>Ameobi - Joint longest serving Newcastle United player in the current squad While Demba Ba and Papiss Cissé receive nationwide praise for their goal scoring efforts this campaign and rightly so - there is one man who perhaps doesn&amp;rsquo;t get enough credit for his endeavours this season. That man is our joint longest serving player in the squad: Shola Ameobi. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a season that&amp;rsquo;s passed when Shola hasn&amp;rsquo;t managed an important goal or two, particularly against Sunderland, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another day.</description>

We were leading 0-1 courtesy of Albert Luque in one of his few games for Newcastle United. The pressure began to increase and the shots started pouring in on the young Dutchman between the sticks, however, after a string of quality saves, NUFC held out for a valuable three points.</description>

      <description>Cissé - Scored a brace for the third game in a row including a stunning second It is hard not to sit back and relish Papiss Cisse&amp;rsquo;s goal scoring form for Newcastle United at the minute - what ever club you support in the Premier League, bar the obvious. Arriving from Germany for £9m - a little more than a quarter of Andy Carroll&amp;rsquo;s fee - he has already notched nine goals in eight games.</description>

      <description>Ben Arfa - Starting to show his raw potential in a Newcastle United shirt I think it is fair to say that Hatem Ben Arfa played his best ever 75 minutes in a Newcastle United shirt last Sunday against West Brom. His touch, pace, movement and vision crafted two goals for Papiss Cissé, before taking time out to score a beautiful effort himself. He didn&amp;rsquo;t put a foot wrong all game long and ran riot any time he got the ball to his feet.</description>

      <description>Brom - Happened to be Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s final game in charge of NUFC The last time Newcastle United met West Brom at the Hawthorns we were on the end of a 3-1 loss, courtesy of Peter Odemwingie &amp;amp; Simon Tchoyi. Peter Lovenkrands managed our only goal in that game, indeed what turned out to be Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s final game in charge of Newcastle United. Things really have changed since then and we are going to West Brom with a different team , a different manager and an improved league position.</description>

      <description>#### Hoilett - Out of contract in the summer and NUFC could do with a new winger
If you followed today&amp;rsquo;s Premier League games then you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely have noticed Blackburn&amp;rsquo;s win away at Wolves, and Junior Hoilett&amp;rsquo;s goal haul in that game. The winger scored twice to clinch three crucial points of Steve Kean&amp;rsquo;s side as they look to pull away from the dreaded relegation zone. The forward is out of contract in the summer according to reports and it will be hard for the Blackburn hierarchy to hold onto him with many clubs sniffing around.</description>

      <description>Gosling - Can he challenge Cabaye or even Guthrie for a first team position? When Newcastle United announced the signing of Dan Gosling I must admit that I was quite excited, and thought we have pulled of a sort of coup. Not that my opinion has changed or anything, but it seems as if Gosling might have an extremely hard time trying to crack the midfield four that currently line out for Newcastle United.</description>

      <description>Ben Arfa - Has raw potential that needs harnessing by Alan Pardew &amp;amp; NUFC I think it is fair to say that when Hatem Ben Arfa came on for Newcastle United against Sunderland on Sunday; the Geordie faithful felt he had the potential to rescue what was an impending disaster. We weren&amp;rsquo;t wrong. The Frenchman gave Kieran Richardson one of the hardest times he&amp;rsquo;ll get all season from anyone on the wing - tearing him to pieces over and over again.</description>

      <description>Pardew - Did himself no favours with an embarrassing celebration for penalty Well, well, well. Another derby. Another fixture against Sunderland that we haven&amp;rsquo;t lost despite playing relatively below par for a chunk of it. However, yet another game that we could&amp;rsquo;ve and ultimately probably should have won. A missed penalty in the final ten minutes, and a glorious opportunity in the area that fell to none other than Mike Williamson - chances that could have won us the game.</description>

      <description>Simpson - Starting to shows signs of becoming a quite average right-back You would have to credit Danny Simpson with the fantastic point Newcastle United managed at Old Trafford against Manchester United earlier in the season, after he clawed what seemed a net destined header, off the line. In fact, his position on the line has saved Newcastle United goals this season. However, it seems to me that with every game that passes - Simpson looks increasingly average and surely isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the first names on Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s matchday teamsheet?</description>

      <description>Ba - Has quite a peculiar contract and a slightly worrying one for NUFC There is some pretty interesting news coming from West Ham owner David Sullivan in the past day where he opens the lid on Demba Ba&amp;rsquo;s contract. The most staggering part of the interview with Iain Dale over at WestHamTillIDie is Sullivan&amp;rsquo;s claim that Demba Ba will receive half the transfer fee for himself should the Senegalese hitman move away from St.</description>

The fantastic season we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far has come down to a great team effort, and one of the performers of the campaign so far is without doubt Fabricio Coloccini.</description>

      <description>Douglas - Didn&amp;rsquo;t make the move to NUFC in January for various reasons When you compare the January transfer window of 2012 to a year previous, it makes for surprising reading. Newcastle United lost Andy Carroll to Liverpool for the guts of forty million pounds, while on that same day managed to bring Stephen Ireland in on loan. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the happiest of times for Toon fans but this year however, couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more of a contrast.</description>

However, the Newcastle hierarchy has been alerted by Wilfried Zaha&amp;rsquo;s availability.</description>

      <description>Mariappa - Being linked with a £3m move to Newcastle United before deadline With just over a week to go in the January transfer window, Alan Pardew is looking to add another couple of faces to an already encouraging squad. With Steven Taylor out for the remainder of the season, it has been well documented that attentions have turned to recruiting a defender. The latest of a long list of linked players is Watford&amp;rsquo;s Adrian Mariappa, their 25 year-old English centre back.</description>

The Bognor Regis striker was offered a remarkable opportunity to show NUFC staff his worth and despite scoring on his debut for the reserve squad with a well taken goal; Newcastle United have decided against signing the 23 year-old. However, it is believed that Rangers FC and a couple of other nPower Championship clubs are interested in taking him on and testing him out.</description>

Of course you would be surprised though, after all Alan Pardew did say that they had no plans to bring in a striker this window - despite giving Jason Prior a trial on Tyneside .</description>

      <description>Taylor - His absence at centre back saw Newcastle United lose points When Steven Taylor pulled up against Chelsea in the final ten minutes I didn&amp;rsquo;t think that the Englishman had suffered an injury that would rule him for the remainder of the Premier League season. However, the news wasn&amp;rsquo;t good and Tayls won&amp;rsquo;t be in action until next season at the earliest - a big pity considering he was playing the best football of his career, alongside Fabricio Coloccini.</description>

      <description>Carroll - What price would you pay to bring the Geordie back to Tyneside? First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s not happening. Andy Carroll will not return to Newcastle United this January or even in the summer. Lazy journalism seems to have spurred on continuous rumours of a return for the £35m man; either on loan or permanently. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Andy himself would indeed welcome a move back to Tyneside in order to refind the form that saw the 6ft 2 striker become one of the most sought after English forwards of his decade.</description>

Newcastle United lay comfortably in the top half of the Premier League and on course for this campaigns expectations.

      <description>Vertonghen - Carr and NUFC scouting team have been watching for some time The last time Newcastle United dished out double figures for a player that I can remember off the cuff was when we signed a certain Fabricio Coloccini, the current captain. Mike Ashley had just bought the club, and Coloccini was one of Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s first signings at the club, arriving from Deportivo. When you consider the performances he has put in for NUFC in the last three seasons then you would have to say that his price tag has been more than justified.</description>

Frenchman Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa had been linked with Newcastle in recent weeks, however Pardew played down any supposed interest. As you would expect, since the injury to Tayls, we are being linked with him again and it&amp;rsquo;s reported that members of our scouting team have advised Alan on the defender.</description>

Fourteen games into the Premier League campaign and we&amp;rsquo;ve managed the same back five for all of it. A proud achievement. However, towards the very end of our encounter with Chelsea yesterday afternoon Steven Taylor happened to damage his achilles and is to undergo surgery on Monday. The inevitability about it all is that Taylor, who has been one of our best players of the season so far , will miss the remainder of the season.</description>

Two penalties and an individual mistake from Ryan Taylor presented Manchester City with three opportunities that they gladly took, and despite a late goal from Dan Gosling - Newcastle United recorded just their first defeat of the season. A team without Cheik Tioté, Leon Best, and Sylvain Marveaux, who would have all been likely starters, played a very solid first half only for two goals in the space of three minutes to finish off any chances we might have had of winning it.</description>

      <description>Signings - Tioté and Yohan Cabaye signings advised by chief scout Graham Carr Despite the extraordinary outburst by Derek Llambias last night Graham Carr has only positive things to say about the two men that run this football club; Mike Ashley &amp;amp; Derek Llambias. Both are still seen as businessmen and their disregard for the supporters of this great football club is held against them, time and time again. They&amp;rsquo;ve made some ridiculous decisions in their time on Tyneside it has to be said but financially they&amp;rsquo;ve brought Newcastle Unite back on a sound footing and are hoping to break-even in the books this year.</description>

Both of these guys have been rumoured to be on Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s wish-list since his arrival and I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that Jermain Defoe has been linked with a move to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park any time he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been playing for Harry Redknapp&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>Cabaye - Turning out to be a contender for Premier League signing of the season In aninteresting read by Mark Douglas over at the Sunday Sun, revealed that Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s scouting team were keeping tabs on Yohan Cabaye, before signing him this summer. To be honest, I find that slightly difficult to believe. If we date back five years from this very day, we&amp;rsquo;re in the year 2006. Those were the years of Glenn Roeder, and the likes of Damien Duff, Obafemi Martins, Anotine Sibierski and so on.</description>

      <description>Maiga - Newcastle United still pressing hard to get a January transfer deal done Despite landing their main target in the summer to partner Leon Best/ Demba Ba Newcastle United still remain very keen on Modibo Maiga of Sochaux. In fact; they&amp;rsquo;ve been out to watch him since the window has closed with a plan to lure him to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park in January. The very fact that Carr &amp;amp; Pardew are so keen to land the striker must tell you something - the lad must have a lot of potential in English football.</description>

      <description>Cabaye - Class act and another shrewd piece of business by Newcastle United We may well look back at Saturday the 17th of September as the day Yohan Cabaye announced his arrival in the Premier League. The Frenchman played arguably his best ninety minutes in a Black and White shirt since his arrival and generally was sublime on the ball. It&amp;rsquo;s just a pity that he didn&amp;rsquo;t get his deserved goal on the day, the crossbar and a magnificent Shay Given save denying him two possible goals.</description>

      <description>Llambias - Released statement explaining failed striker hunt after window shut When the window slammed shut at 11PM on Thursday night most Newcastle United fans were disappointed, tired, and angered that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t managed to recruit a new striker with £40m plus in our back-pockets and with over 8 months to do it. Of course we got Demba Ba in early on in the season - because he was a free transfer, looked for modest wages and wasn&amp;rsquo;t incredibly old.</description>

      <description>#### Maiga - Desperate to join Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s Newcastle United today
Modibo Maiga has been desperate for a move to Newcastle United since the day they expressed their first interest in him. He has had quarrels with the board, refused to play; dropped from squads and all the likes - but still he remains a Sochaux player as we approach the final seven hours of the summer transfer window. Despite the signing of a much needed full-back in Davide Santon, NUFC still haven&amp;rsquo;t added a striker to their ranks to add to our collection already.</description>

A whole summer was spent trying to find a new club for Joey Barton, get the best possible price for Jose Enrique and relocate Kevin Nolan. The whole summer is nearly gone; and we&amp;rsquo;re still crying out for a striker, and a left-back.</description>

      <description>#### Santon - Would be a real statement of intent from NUFC if they pulled it off
There are emerging reports suggesting that Newcastle United are in advanced talks with Inter Milan&amp;rsquo;s Davide Santon over a move to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. I think most people will know Santon and also be aware of the talent he is. He was very much a wonderkid in the making a couple of years ago but for one reason or another - the Italian side may be willing to let the 20 year-old depart the San Siro.</description>

The striker is 24 years of age, fitting our age category for recruitments and is out of contract at the end of this forthcoming season - meaning he could be obtained for a half decent price.</description>

Pieters, who is being sought after by Alan Pardew to replace the departed Jose Enrique is believed to have met the release clause in Pieters contract which is rumoured to have been about £6m.</description>

With a deal for Paris St.Germain striker Mevlut Erding dead or seemingly so - you really have to ask yourself what strikers Newcastle United are still pursuing. Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe, Shane Long, and even Jermaine Beckford have all been linked with us this summer to name but a few but it is unlikely that any of the above will end up on Tyneside come the end of August.</description>

      <description>Questions - Who will be at Newcastle United and who&amp;rsquo;ll be gone come Aug 31st? Seemingly the drama surrounding Joey Barton, Twitter and the board and indeed Jose Enrique&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;impending&amp;rsquo; move to Liverpool is somewhat putting our transfer exploits on the back-burner - for the media at least. Today we found out that there have been talks with Tranquillo Barnetta and NUFC and that those very talks were going quite well - only for the Swiss to suffer an injury that could postpone the move to January or indeed permanently.</description>

It could well be just me, but I think there is something pretty serious going on at Newcastle United right now and it might not be very encouraging at all. Recent criticisms of the board and their regime have been well documented in the press the last week or so, with Jose Enrique openly venting his frustration at Mike Ashley and the lack of ambition show by the club.</description>

Playing for Newcastle United is an honour for any player. Nile Ranger is a 20 year old forward who has bags of potential; indeed potential to be as good as anything we&amp;rsquo;ve produced in quite a while - including Andy Carroll.</description>

In the last couple of days, Irish midfielder Darron Gibson has been strongly linked with a move away from Manchester United and more noticeably to the Stadium of Light to join an already meagre midfield setup. However, as I mentioned in articles before this; Newcastle United and SAFC seem to share an awful lot of similar targets and are inevitably linked with the same players, over and over again.</description>

      <description>Ireland - Has raw talent but can he regain old form at St. James&amp;rsquo; Park? There are emerging reports that Alan Pardew may well be interested in bringing Stephen Ireland back to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park on a permanent basis this summer. The Irishman, who had an injury plagued loan spell with Newcastle never really got going and played a mere 2 times for the club: both as substitute appearances. I think we all remember what a player this guy was only a couple of years ago; indeed he was awarded the Player Of the Year award at Eastlands for his fantastic endeavours throughout the season.</description>

I suppose there&amp;rsquo;s two sides to the story regarding Kevin Nolan&amp;rsquo;s departure to West Ham. A large chunk of the fans will blame the ownership for stalling on a new deal, and failing to reward their captain for the fantastic season his put in on our return to the Premier League, yielding twelve goals. The other side, will see Nolan&amp;rsquo;s move as a step forward for Newcastle United; one more high waged player off the bill and an aging, slow midfielder no longer our responsibility.</description>

From the top of my head, since the end of the season, the following players have been strongly linked with both of us: Jay Bothroyd, Sebastian Larsson, Demba Ba, Peter Crouch, Charles N&amp;rsquo;Zogbia, Emile Heskey, Kieran Westwood and now Craig Gardner , to mention but a few.</description>

      <title>Newcastle United ‘agree terms’ with Senegalese international Demba Ba</title>

      <description>Ba - Reports are suggesting we have signed the African for a small amount There are reports swirling around both Twitter and a few radio stations that we have signed Demba Ba for a minimal amount. The Senegalese international is supposedly a free transfer now after a clause in his contract was triggered, seeing him become a free agent courtesy of West Ham&amp;rsquo;s relegation from the Premier League. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of us will have noticed that he scored a nice few goals in his time at Upton Park and tried his best to keep them in the top flight.</description>

      <description>N&amp;rsquo;Zogbia - Seems like he wants to return to St. James&amp;rsquo; Park again I must admit; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really that disappointed to see Charles N&amp;rsquo;Zogbia depart Newcastle United on January 3 years ago and in fact, was excited at the prospect of capturing Ryan Taylor. Taylor, who just couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop scoring against Newcastle each season had indeed nabbed a very important goal in that very season, a spectacular free-kick if I remember correctly.</description>

      <description>Gervinho - Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too surprised if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t arrive on Tyneside I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most the Premier League are aware of the Gervinho scenario by now. Over a week ago he was meant to have signed for Newcastle United, alongside Yohan Cabaye. The funny this is: neither have signed officially yet however, Cabaye is expected to be revealed holding our new 2011&amp;frasl;12 jersey as early as tomorrow. I am also quite sure that most internet friendly NUFC fans will have wandered on to Twitter at some stage, whether it&amp;rsquo;s been to follow us or indeed keep tabs on the many rumour &amp;lsquo;merchants&amp;rsquo; flooding the Newcastle news scene lately.</description>

      <description>Cabaye - Likely to replace Joey Barton as the club looks to offload the POTS The board at this club continue to confuse me with their antics. Firstly they sack an absolute gent of a manager who after bringing Newcastle United back to the Premier League at first attempt, was looking like he would finish midtable after some stunning results throughout the season - including an away win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton &amp;amp; indeed absolute routs at home to Aston Villa and Sunderland.</description>

      <description>Carew - Released by Aston Villa today after completing loan spell at Stoke City I have always been a fan of John Carew and was quite disappointed to see him go to Villa first, especially as a swap deal for Milan Baros. His first season with Villa saw him produce 3 goals in 11 appearances, his first happened to come against us when we beat them 3-1. A strong, combative CF is what Carew brings to the plate.</description>

      <description>Coloccini - Has been outstanding in only his 2nd season in the Premier League I think we all remember Fabricio Coloccini&amp;rsquo;s first season in the Premier League. Lack of pace, and prone to many a blunder. Some of us asked ourselves if he was really worth the £10.5m Kevin Keegan paid over, if in fact he was Kevin&amp;rsquo;s choice at all.
Following relegation, Coloccini did not leave and it seemed as if no one was going to take a gamble on the Argentinian international after what was nothing short of a disastrous first season in English football.</description>

      <description>Rodallega - Someone who could do a very good job at Newcastle United It was great on Sunday to sit back and watch both Birmingham vs. Fulham &amp;amp; Wigan Athletic vs. West Ham carefree. We did not need to worry about Newcastle United because we had guaranteed our safety a week earlier. Also, looking at Birmingham, Wigan and West Ham - you might also remember that we beat them all away from home this season, and indeed managed to get 16 out of a possible 18 points from those three troubled teams.</description>

      <description>Dempsey - A brilliant player that has scored over 10 goals this season I have been watching Clint Dempsey for a few years now and he continues to impress me. His flair, vision and ability to score goals is something that a lot of people have not recognised, and he has not got half enough praise for his endeavours for both his country, and for Fulham over the years. He would be right up my list of players to sign this summer although I&amp;rsquo;m sure Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s wishlist would differ quite a bit from mine!</description>

      <description>Gervinho - Strong links between him and Newcastle since Hughton&amp;rsquo;s time The rumours regards Gervinho&amp;rsquo;s future at Lille have been circling for the past 18 months. Lille signed the Ivorian from Le Mans for a fee of about €9m and he has been scoring goals quite frequently in Ligue 1, however he is already being linked with a move away from France and it is more than likely that he will make a move this summer.</description>

Newcastle United and Manchester United locking horns always seems like quite a big game, a game between two big sides when reality there is one far superior side lining out on most occasions and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been us for quite a while.</description>

      <description>#### Houllier - Faces a difficult challenge in motivating a lacklustre Villa side
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m alone in my opinion of Gerard Houllier but I regard the Frenchman as one of those managers who always seem to get decent jobs, yet have very little understanding of the modern game. When Martin O&amp;rsquo;Neill left Villa Park things took a change for the worst. Milner had gone, Ashley Young was looking for a way out (still is) and John Carew; one of the most prominent strikers was loaned out to Stoke City for the season.</description>

I watched the whole ninety minutes of Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s thumping at the Britannia on Saturday and was less than impressed as you would. We were dominated, looked heartless and make a desperate Stoke City team look like a team a division above us.
Jon Walters header before the break was a great header from a great Jermaine Pennant cross; take nothing away from them.</description>

      <description>Pull the other one one might say. However, news is news. According for the Sunday Mirror; Newcastle United could be owned by a wealthy Indian in the summer, should they confirm Premier League safety. A £260m figure is being touted as the price tag Anil Ambani is willing to offer Mike, but the real question is: would the smart-minded Englishman accept that bundle of notes? Again, take this with a rather large pinch of salt because I expect it to be utter tosh, per usual.</description>

      <description>Any time he has come on the pitch he has upped the tempo. His strength, height, ability in the air and his quick feet have caused problems for Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and many other teams this season. He is 19 years of age, 6 feet 2 inches in height and has the potential to a Premier League class striker if not more. Nile Ranger&amp;rsquo;s attitude however is something that has caused problems in the past and continues to do so on a smaller level in 2011.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that when I heard Alan Pardew was close to coming the next Newcastle United boss after the shock dismissal of Chris Hughton I felt sick. Why would we replace a top man like Hughton who was doing a great job in his first season in the Premier League as manager with a guy who&amp;rsquo;s last job was at Southampton; A League 1 side. It didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all.</description>

      <description>Best - Has thrived since Andy Carroll&amp;rsquo;s departure to Liverpool in January When Andy Carroll made his shock deadline day move to Liverpool FC for a staggering initial fee of £35m - Newcastle United fans started to worry as to where our goals for the remainder of the Premier League campaign would come from. It might be easy to say now, but I never doubted our ability to score goals with or without the Newcastle born front-man.</description>

      <description>One man who won&amp;rsquo;t be short for money for years to come is our very own Cheik Tiote, after signing a new six and a half year deal with Newcastle United. Tioté, who had been linked with moves to Chelsea, Arsenal and even Manchester United put pen to paper on a rather outrageous deal in all honesty. It is one of the longest contracts I have ever heard of in football and if we&amp;rsquo;re to be realistic here, he will not see out those years at the Toon.</description>

Žigic is 6&amp;rsquo;8 whilst Mike stands at a modest 6&amp;rsquo;4.

      <description>In his first real season in the Premier League Jose Enrique has shown his critics why Newcastle United splashed out £6.25m on him during Sam Allardyce&amp;rsquo;s short reign at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. Enrique has turned in world class performances for the majority of the season and unsurprisingly, has attracted interest from some of the top clubs in England and indeed throughout Europe. It is believed an initial enquiry from AC Milan for Jose was turned down rather abruptly during the January transfer window but with only 18 months let on his contract; clubs are circling like vultures, eyeing up the soon-to-be Spanish international.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Off to Anfield whether pushed or shoved out of St. James&amp;rsquo; Park irst things first; yesterdays deadline window was no doubt the most enthralling transfer window I have ever followed, but Sky Sports really did over-do the whole thing. Every 5 minutes they popped back to David Craig outside St.James&amp;rsquo; Park and he seemed to have a new story, or something a little different each time. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that, they were in Liverpool trying to get the latest on the Fernando Torres deal from their correspondent, amidst overly-excited LFC fans.</description>

      <description>That sick feeling of Sunderland&amp;rsquo;s 93rd minute equaliser still lingers somewhat as I write this article, but it could have been worse; it could have been a 93rd winner for them, and our best striker could have handed in a transfer request the day after the game - Imagine that!
However, we proved yet again yesterday that we are better than Sunderland on the pitch, and were so unlucky not to have done the double over Steve Bruce&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

I think everyone will remember at least two of Shola Ameobi&amp;rsquo;s many goals against Sunderland throughout the years, and that&amp;rsquo;s without counting his brace when we thrashed them at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park at Halloween. He has a very good record of scoring against SAFC down through the years, and we will need him more than ever tomorrow at the Stadium Of Light.</description>

      <description>Best - Should be available for the tie against Stevenage this evening It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year again when the FA Cup dominates the scene. Newcastle United are away to Stevenage at 5.30 and it is live on TV, which is a bit of a novelty in FA Cup ties nowadays. However, it won&amp;rsquo;t be an easy feat against the League 2 outfit, if we give them too much respect.</description>

      <description>I have noticed in the last couple of weeks amongst many Newcastle United fans, how excited they are at the prospect of Robbie Keane arriving on Tyneside. I however, do not want the Tallaght man to join Newcastle United and a lot of Irish NUFC fans are in agreements with me. Of course, you will wonder why I do no want to sign a proven striker, that has scored at the highest level , from the World Cup to the Premier League, indeed a forward who has scored goals anywhere he went.</description>

      <description>#### Jô - Would be an extremely good addition to Newcastle United this January
It is very likely that Edin Džeko will join Manchester City this January in a €35m move come January as VfL Wolfsburg have lowered their asking initial asking price. Another ridiculous fee to pay for a striker who I can only guess would be delighted to join the club for its wages. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Edin is a fine talent and will score a lot of goals given the chance, but he isn&amp;rsquo;t worth any more than £17m in all honesty.</description>

Frustrating isn&amp;rsquo;t the word. When Fabricio Coloccini put the ball into his own net in the last ten minutes of the game, my heart sank and I nearly dropped my turkey sandwich. We had dominated the second half, every ball was ours, Carroll won every header, Cheik Tiote cleaned up every spill in centre midfield and Jose Enrique &amp;amp; Jonas Gutierrez swept up everything on the leftside of the pitch.</description>

      <description>NUFC - Has been a hectic year for Newcastle United as club but enjoy Xmas! It really has been a frantic year as a Newcastle United supporter. From January till May, we were crowned Coca Cola Championship champions with a record number of points, and back in the Premier League after a little while away. We had made great improvements since the bad years upon Tyneside, with stability under Chris Hughton, and a great team spirit amongst the lads in the dressing -room.</description>

We may well be in for an early Christmas present with the new that Hatem Ben Arfa, could be quite close to a permanent deal at Newcastle United. The French winger who joined this summer thanks to Chris Hughton, played less than five games, in which he scored a stunner against Everton at Goodison Park, in an excellent away win.</description>

      <description>Barton - Newcastle have set an asking fee of £1.5m for the midfielder Everything that you hear from Newcastle United nowadays must be taken in with quite the opposite. Since Mike Ashley took over the club, things are gone bezerk to say the very least. As I said in my last article, we cannot really trust the owners of the club until they have handed over the keys to new owners and are on their way home - indeed the likelihood of that happening is quite low.</description>

      <description>A lot of people aren&amp;rsquo;t really sure of Alan Pardew yet, and one of the areas he can send out a message to Newcastle United fans is in the transfer market. In 10 or so days times, the January transfer window will open for business. Teams will enquire for players, other will try their utmost to hang on to their key men. Indeed that&amp;rsquo;s what I expect us to do this January, try keep Andy Carroll, Joey Barton and some of our youngsters at NUFC for the remainder of the season.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Wants to move on and continuing play with Newcastle United Andy Carroll has said he wants to stay with Newcastle United and isn&amp;rsquo;t seeking a move away from St.James&amp;rsquo; Park at least four times this season already, but the media still persist with the same question. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Carroll hasn&amp;rsquo;t lost his temper in these interviews, because I know I would if I had answered a question umpteen times yet still got asked the exact same thing a few weeks later.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Scored a peach of a goal today in a very good win dedicated to Chris First things first - what a brave man Mike Ashley is showing up to Newcastle United v Liverpool today. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see his unsightly figure in the luxurious stands of St.James&amp;rsquo; Park during Alan Pardew&amp;rsquo;s first game in charge. However, I expect it was exactly that that lured the owner to the game, to oversee his new signing, and to decide whether he needed the sack just yet.</description>

      <description>I heard at about 1.10pm roughly from a source at the club that Chris Hughton was on his way out of St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. It was shocking news to receive, especially for me when I was stuck on a three hour long bus journey. However, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether it was confirmed or not. At 2pm that day (yesterday) Newcastle United confirmed that Chris Hughton had been sacked as manager of Newcastle United and the search for a replacement had already begun, with Peter Beardsley taking charge of the Liverpool game forthcoming.</description>

      <description>Hughton - William Hill have suspended betting on his dismissal this afternoon First things first - surely this cannot be right? Chris Hughton, the man who brought Newcastle United from the Championship back up to the Premier League with a record number of points, was responsible for the 5-1 thrashing of our rivals this season, our fantastic display against Chelsea in the Cup with a 4-3 win at Stamford Bridge, and the man who guided NUFC to a precious 1-0 away win at the Emirates to Arsenal.</description>

      <description>A lot of people seem to have lost faith and perhaps respect for Steven Taylor over the last few months, with the debacle over where his future lay very much up in the air. We read reports of Steven wanting close to £60,000 a week if he was to sign a new deal, and this outraged some Newcastle supporters, rightly so. However, his agent, and the controversial one at that, came out and dismissed any idea of Taylor wanting those outstanding wages, and said he just wanted to play for the club he loves.</description>

      <description>7 goals so far this season, including the memorable one against Arsenal at the Emirates to secure a truly inspirational win. Called up by Fabio Capello at the age of 21 to represent his country, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much better for the Geordie lad. It&amp;rsquo;s not the fact he&amp;rsquo;s one of our own that makes us so happy with him, it&amp;rsquo;s the type of striker he is. A nuisance for defenders, a great header of the ball, an old fashioned CF to put it to you straight.</description>

Joey Barton has hit the headlines again, not for his great performances of late which includes 3 assists in the last 4 games, but for another reason. As the many various papers and online journals have pointed out, Joey Barton struck Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach with a right handed clout.</description>

Observing all the latest news about Newcastle in the latest few weeks has led me to inevitably write this article, quite frankly because I can&amp;rsquo; believe what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing day in day out.</description>

There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything shocking about it really, apart from the fact Blackpool had a great keeper on the day, and two guys who could finish their chances. So far we&amp;rsquo;ve two losses, a draw and a win. For a newly promoted side, having to play Manchester United, Aston Villa , Wolves and Blackpool, that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad showing at all.</description>

At home to Blackpool, the scene is set for Ben Arfa to do the business alongside his teammate Cheick Tioté who also joined from Dutch side FC Twente. We can&amp;rsquo;t really expect goals upon goals from either, but hopefully tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;ll get a glimpse of what they can both do, and Ben Arfa in particular.</description>

      <description>St.James&amp;rsquo; - Will be graced by Hatem Ben Arfa &amp;amp; Cheick Tioté against Blackpool Five players signed, and a job well done by Chris Hughton and co. James Perch, Dan Gosling, Sol Campbell, Cheick Tioté &amp;amp; Hatem Ben Arfa all signed for Newcastle United,a nd four of those on a permanent basis. The pick of the bunch really is a coin toss between Dan Gosling and Hatem Ben Arfa, but the fact Ben Arfa is fit and ready to go unlike his counterpart, perhaps shades it for the Frenchman.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Has been looked at throughout the window but staying put It&amp;rsquo;s the day every fan loves, it&amp;rsquo;s just like Christmas, your Birthday, a bank holiday and Easter all rolled in together. That day is here, the final day of the summer transfer window. Often a day when some managers panic and buy a couple of players for overinflated prices and end up being flops, or where other managers snatch a coup in the last minute to save their clubs season.</description>

      <description>What a name, what a name. Ricky van Wolfswinkel has today been linked with a move to Newcastle United just before the window slams shut for this summer. The Daily Mail have an article about it, but there&amp;rsquo;s discussion in volumes throughout Dutch forums about his proposed move to Newcastle and it seems as if the Utrecht fans expect him to leave for St.James&amp;rsquo; in the next day or so. The only time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this guy play is when he destroyed Celtic with a hat-trick and I was very impressed by his finishing and overall play.</description>

      <title>Joey Barton v Wolves – A sign of a changing player</title>

      <description>I would like to highlight the word &amp;lsquo;changing&amp;rsquo; in this article. We won&amp;rsquo;t forget the dark dark days that Joey Barton has put Newcastle United Football Club through since his £5.8m move from Manchester City and we won&amp;rsquo;t forget that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t half as much as he should have. Saying that, there&amp;rsquo;s strong evidence to suggest that he&amp;rsquo;s maturing as a footballer and as an individual. It&amp;rsquo;s also obvious that Wolverhampton Wanderers targeted Barton today, and hoped that he would retaliate - ending up in a sending off and inevitably, a Wolves victory.</description>

      <description>Keane - Can you see him playing his football at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park this season? Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m all for it and think Robbie Keane would be a very addition to the Newcastle United squad. However, what I want to know - is whether you, the Geordie fans think that the Irishman would be a good signing by Chris Hughton and his team? I mean, Keane is 30 years of age and arguably past his peak.</description>

      <description>Ben Arfa - Will fly to Newcastle United to complete the loan move One thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure - Jean Claude Dassier likes talking and talk he will. According to GOAL.com, who can often be well off the mark on transfer stories, Ben Arfa will finally complete his long forlorn move to Newcastle United in the next couple of days. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re only telling you what&amp;rsquo;s in the news, but I&amp;rsquo;d be fairly sure that the Frenchman will indeed make the trip to St.</description>

      <description>At this stage, no one really takes too much heed or notice of Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier and his constant statements to the French media, however we could well be nearing the end of the the whole Ben Arfa saga. Today the Frenchman (Dassier) claimed that a deal had been agreed between both parties and Ben Arfa could well be heading to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. In fact, he has already travelled to Newcastle by himself, however to no avail as he was recalled before any talks with Chris Hughton and co.</description>

Taylor, who has had trouble with contract talks for quite a while now has supposedly gone a step too far in negotiations and with his demands, and now finds himself on the &amp;lsquo;For Sale&amp;rsquo; list.</description>

Even after Marseille president claiming Ben Arfa would be staying in France with L&amp;rsquo;OM, and even after Hughton admitted he didn&amp;rsquo;t know where the rumours of this supposed capture were coming from - Hatem Ben Arfa has been spotted in Newcastle Airport. Whether this is true, or just unbelievable Photoshoppin&amp;rsquo;, either way there&amp;rsquo;s questions still to be answered.</description>

It seems as if Chris Hughton is keen to sign Erding, because if all reports are accurate, this is the second bid that has been rejected for his services. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I know a lot about the forward, but Arsenal were interested not very long ago so he&amp;rsquo;s obviously decent.</description>

      <description>Reports in the Shields Gazette are suggesting that French winger Hatem Ben Arfa who has been strongly linked with a move to Newcastle United - has waved goodbye to his fans at Marseille and his sights are now set on trying the Premier League. Ben Arfa who a couple of days ago came off the bench for Marseille assisted their only goal of the game with a delightful chip beyond Caen&amp;rsquo;s centre-backs.</description>

      <description>Ben Arfa - Could add so much to Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s midfield this season We all know, or should do that Hatem Ben Arfa hasn&amp;rsquo;t been outstanding at Marseille since he moved there and his attitude has been a major stumbling block for both the club and himself. In the last week or so, we&amp;rsquo;ve been strenuously linked with the Frenchman, and even with my sheer disgust of French footballers of the modern setup, I would sincerely love to see the Tunisian born Ben Arfa wear Black and White this season.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s interest in Hatem Ben Arfa has been well reported in the media in the last week or so, and today it&amp;rsquo;s said that we&amp;rsquo;ve had an initial bid rejected for the Frenchman from Marseille. The left-winger has found himself on the wrong side of his manager and the club are looking to let the lad go, on loan or perhaps for a fee. The French paper &amp;lsquo;La Provence&amp;rsquo; has reported today that a bid from Newcastle United has indeed been rejected, but the French side have offered him again to Newcastle, for a bit more.</description>

The years during Sir Bobby Robson&amp;rsquo;s tenure at Newcastle were perhaps the best days of the football club so far. A real gentleman in charge, that sent out a team capable of beating anyone. We were able to defeat anyone in those glorious years, years that saw us in the Champions League, in with big names such as Inter Milan, Juventus, Barcelona , so on and so forth.</description>

      <description>The dislike of Dennis Wise for many Newcastle United fans stems from Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s departure, James Milner&amp;rsquo;s move to Aston Villa, the signing of the Uruguayan Gonzalez, Xisco&amp;rsquo;s arrival on Tyneside and many other incidents at the club. He did spot Bassong and a few other promising young players but will never be warmly welcomed back to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park if he arrives some time in the future. we passed down the chance to sign Bastian Schweinsteiger who reportedly was keen for a switch to Newcastle United, Wise again having something to do with this.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see the goals but they were meant to be nice finishes from all three. Whilst seeing off The Cumbrians, the Toon lads sported the new Newcastle United away strip, and it&amp;rsquo;s a very nice jersey to say the least.</description>

The Ghanaian, who had a very good World Cup with the Africans is very much sought after, and whether this report has any accuracy or not remains to be seen. However, only a couple of days ago, Annan admitted that he would love to play in the Premier League, but only after reported interest from Chelsea and Manchester United.</description>

However, nearly a fortnight into the transfer window, we&amp;rsquo;ve one player already signed for a rumoured fee of £1.5 - 2m and another promising youngster by the name of Dan Gosling seemingly set to wear the Black and White jersey of Newcastle United this season.</description>

      <description>Arévalo - Been a rock for Uruguay during their World Cup adventure in SA You may or may not have been watching Uruguay in the World Cup this year but if you have, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed their midfielders, and this guy in particular. Egidio Arévalo is a ball winning centre midfielder, to put it mildly. In the games I&amp;rsquo;ve watched him, he&amp;rsquo;s chased after players when they haven&amp;rsquo;t had the ball and generally won the ball back, without committing too many fouls in the process.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Committed to Newcastle United and our Premier League survival bid Well we know Stoke were interested and who could blame them. A strong, tall old fashioned centre-forward at only 20 years of age and with a newly promoted team. In fact, he would have been the perfect player for Stoke City, and the &amp;lsquo;football&amp;rsquo; they play. With James Beattie looking like he may well leave The Britannia, Carroll would&amp;rsquo;ve been the ideal replacement but the Geordie lad is committed to his home-town club.</description>

      <description>News from Sky Sports claim that Newcastle United are becoming extremely interested in Everton&amp;rsquo;s Dan Gosling and may well swoop for the 20 year-old. Gosling, who has been in a tangle with new contract negotiations may well leave this club this summer and Chris Hughton seems keen to recruit the 2009 FA Cup 4th Round hero. I must say, I&amp;rsquo;d be really pleased with Gosling at Newcastle if we could manage it but we do have a of midfield players at the same time.</description>

The normal Black and White stripes as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, with Northern Rock still there but the Puma logo in the centre of the body, like the Adidas one too.</description>

      <description>Erdinç - €6m bid reportedly rejected for the Frenchman in the last day or so There are two questions here that need answering for many Newcastle United fans and they are as follows. Is this guys real name Mevlüt Erdinç or Melvut Erding? Who is he? and finally, do Newcastle United &amp;amp; Chris Hughton actually have some money to spend this summer? I can personally say that I don&amp;rsquo;t know a lot about Erdinç and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m an amid follower of Ligue 1 in France.</description>

      <description>dos Santos - Would be a great signing for Chris Hughton &amp;amp; Newcastle United Watching the World Cup so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been impressed by two teams, and one of them was not England. Argentina and Mexico have both had a real go at the competition and it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that the Mexicans had to meet Maradona&amp;rsquo;s side in the first knock-out round of the competition. A very offside goal from Carlos Tevez knocked spirits in Javier Aguirre&amp;rsquo;s camp and they never recovered.</description>

      <description>The usual hype of England in the World Cup, the talk of them winning it. The talk of Wayne Rooney establishing himself as the best English striker in football for a long long time, the chat of Fabio Capello leading the Three Lions to World Cup glory. The media expected, the country anticipated but the competition against produced same-old England. What could have been if the linesman actually opened his eyes and saw the Lampard &amp;lsquo;goal&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Jonas - Should be back just in time for the Argentina - Mexico Last 16 encounter The FIFA World Cup in South Africa is shaping up nicely with England just about managing to qualify and setup an exciting tie against Germany. Many people have tipped England to win the World Cup, but I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly see this happening. Instead on reporting on every little trace of a rumour that blows around Tyneside, we here at Tyne Time thought we&amp;rsquo;d take a look at the World Cup and see how our own very Jonas Gutierrez is getting on.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been lots of rumours floating around Tyneside in the last few days while the World Cup progresses nicely but one of them, regarding Bolton defender Jlloyd Samuel is some real news as Chris Hughton admitted an interest in the Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago international. Samuel, now 29 may well be leaving the Reebok Stadium this year because he contract runs out very soon and Bolton Wanderers would be quite foolish not to cash in on him.</description>

      <description>Jonas - Eager to do well with Argentina in South Africa this month Indeed Jonas Gutierrez is so concentrated on this upcoming World Cup that he forgot to pack normal everyday clothes! Packing just football gear and a tracksuit, Jonas forgot to put some normal clothes in what seemingly was a very small suitcase. However, he claims that it&amp;rsquo;s his ultimate focus for Argentina at the World Cup this year that inevitably resulted in him arriving in South Africa with no normal clothes to wear.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m the only person who thinks that Newcastle United should move as quick as they can and snap up Manchester City former Martin Petrov. The Bulgarian was released from the club after a good three years at the club. The winger is a talented player and alongside Sylvinho, Mancini waved goodbye to his services at the club, simply because they are not good enough for what is becoming a monstrous squad, and that&amp;rsquo;s not mentioning the wage bill!</description>

      <description>Growing reports over the last few days or so claim that Kris Boyd is keen on leaving Rangers - for Newcastle United. The Scottish International has signalled that he is indeed leaving Rangers this season and on a free transfer. Various clubs are in for the hitman however if rumours are to be believed, Boyd is keen on playing for Newcastle United in the Premier League in August. I think we realise at this stage that we have no money to spend this summer on any new players so we won&amp;rsquo;t be expecting Jamie O&amp;rsquo;Hara, Hamit Altintop or Kevin Prince Boetang arriving on Tyneside any time soon, as if it was going to happen anyway.</description>

      <description>Enrique - Believes Spain the credentials to lift the greatest trophy in the world Jose Enrique, left back extraordinaire for a talented Newcastle squad, will most probably be one of Spain’s primary defensive juggernauts in the future. As the team vies for a World Cup Championship on the heels of a European Championship (2008), he made his comments regarding Spain’s chances of winning.
Never one to shy away from hullabaloo, the six-foot defender emphatically stated that Spain has a great shot at winning the World Cup, and is only one of eight teams in the world capable of the feat.</description>

From Hamit Altintop to Jimmy Bullard, Kris Boyd to Dedryck Boyata. The rumour mill is alive and healthy that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. The one that really sticks out though is the possible signing of Nedum Onuoha from Manchester City.</description>

An enthralling game at Wembley today saw the Tangerines come from behind twice and then go ahead all in the first half. A wonderful Charlie Adam free-kick, a Taylor-Fletcher nod in and a quick finish from veteran Brett Ormerod saw Holloways side reach the promised land alongside ourselves and West Brom.</description>

Indeed here it is. A statement released by the club yesterday outlined the boards&amp;rsquo; plans for the coming few years, which 1.</description>

To be quite honest, I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why. This is the lad we bought on the final day in January from Coventry, who was their leading scorer at that stage and well up the scoring charts .</description>

When we suffered relegation on the 24th of May 2009, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there was many fans who expected such a rumbustious and professional display for the 45 fixtures so far. The team lost a fair few players, from Michael Owen, to Obafemi Martins.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it all at this stage, from Ronaldinho to Newcastle United, and now to Carlos Puyol to the Magpies, but no, there&amp;rsquo;s more! Steven Taylor has been today linked with a switch to Barcelona. Yes, Barcelona, not Birmingham, the Spanish giants and one of the best teams in the world. Where the media come up with this stuff is unbelievable but that would be the most ridiculous rumour I&amp;rsquo;ve heard to date.</description>

The attendance puts Sunderland&amp;rsquo;s and indeed many more Premier League club&amp;rsquo;s to shame and just shows what a footballing town Newcastle Upon-Tyne really is. Before the match, Chris Hughton announced that Xisco would not be in his plans for the upcoming Premier League campaign and he indeed expects the Spaniard to move on.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re making our transfer plans already which is good to see but if we do indeed making a formal offer for Huseklepp, I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll be surrounded by other clubs looking to take the Norwegian off FC Brann.</description>

      <description>There are reports flying about the place in the last couple of days that Fitz Hall could be arriving on Tyneside on a permanent basis once the transfer window reopens. The defender, on-loan from Queens Park Rangers has seen a turbulent time at Loftus Road and indeed has seen the club dig their way through more than 3 managers this season. Their current manager in Neil Warnock could well have very different plans for the back four he wants next season and indeed Hall may not be included in them.</description>

Jonas Gutierrez will represent Argentina at the World Cup in South Africa in June, which is a major honour for the winger that has played this season in the Coca Cola Championship. The former Mallorca man who arrived on Tyneside in rather controversial circumstances didn&amp;rsquo;t really set the world alight in his first season the Premier League but then again, how many Newcastle United players last season really did impress you besides Sebastien Bassong?</description>

He was there for Shearer&amp;rsquo;s later glory days at the start of the new millennium and now he himself, has been playing pretty well in a Newcastle shirt of late. A lot of people regard Ameobi as a clumsy, lanky striker and some people have attributed the nick name &amp;lsquo;Stumbling Bambi&amp;rsquo; to the Toon striker as well.</description>

      <description>The vibes coming from the hierarchy of Newcastle United are very encouraging ones indeed of late, and Mike Ashley is seemingly doing the impossible, in becoming a slightly better owner. For now anyway. A season in the Coca Cola Championship has given us time to think about things on Tyneside and the goings on at the club while at the same time, perched on top of the table, ready for regaining our Premier League status.</description>

      <description>2009 - That horrible day when a Damien Duff OG sent Newcastle United down I don&amp;rsquo;t think many Newcastle United fans will forget the day we were relegated from the Premier League, a fine day it was too, weather-wise. Pity it was the day Newcastle United waved goodbye to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years but a year later, we&amp;rsquo;re back up again, up with the big-boys so to speak.</description>

      <description>### Hutton - Supposedly has held talks with Newcastle already
Before I start about the Hutton story, need I bring up the whole thing about West Brom scoring late since the start of the season? Another goal, in the 96th minute, denying Watford a huge victory. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how many times they&amp;rsquo;ve scored in the last five minutes, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly double figures. Anyway, the latest news surrounding Newcastle besides the big matter of a Premier League spot being officially secured tonight, is of our reported interest in Tottenham&amp;rsquo;s Alan Hutton.</description>

      <title>Pancrate prepares for departure as promotion party looms</title>

      <description>Pancrate - Will more than likely depart St.James&amp;rsquo; at the end of the season Fabrice Pancrate arrived on a free from France earlier this season and on his full debut, scored an absolute screamer to seal a very good three points at home to Watford. It was a brilliant bit of skill from the 30 year-old but since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen very little of the former PSG winger. In fact, Pancrate is reportedly already making plans for life after Newcastle United and indeed when our Coca Cola Championship campaign comes to an end.</description>

      <description>###NUST - Are they wasting their time with plan to buy Newcastle United FC?
NUST were big news last year when Mike Ashley was desperate to sell Newcastle United. They were on Sky Sports boasting plans of owning the club or indeed I should say, the fans owning the club in a similar style to Barcelona. However, they never made the offer if reports are to be correct and they never managed to get hold of the North-East club.</description>

      <description>The descending rain at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park last night could not dampen spirits around Newcastle as the Magpies look very certain for an immediate return to the Premier League. In what was a tight and physical affair, Nottingham put the lads to the test in every department and on another day could&amp;rsquo;ve nabbed a couple of goals. Indeed goals from Shola Ameobi who replaced the injured Andy Carroll and our Spanish left-back José Enrique secured a very important three points for Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s side.</description>

      <description>West Bromwich Albion seem to love scoring in the last 15 5 minutes of their games as we&amp;rsquo;ve seen them ditch their 1 point for a more desirable 3 in the dying minutes of many a game this season. Graham Dorrans has been in flying form this season and will no doubt have caught the eye of a couple of Premier League teams in the process of keeping West Brom&amp;rsquo;s automatic promotion hopes alive.</description>

      <description>Andy Carroll has responded extremely well to the bad news surrounding Newcastle United and indeed the incident between the two local lads, Steven Taylor and Carroll. In fact a goal on the hour mark away to a very good Doncaster side to secure a vital win in Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s season so far. In what&amp;rsquo;s been a fairly smooth sailing season on Tyneside with Chris Hughton and Colin Calderwood doing a very good job, Andy Carroll and his jaw-breaking scenario has caused some unwelcome bad vibes around the Toon.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the late post up and indeed for the missing article last week but I&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy with other activities. Last week, Dean predicted a 1-2 win to Newcastle United against Bristol and I predicted a 0-2 win for us. Neither of us were right but the previous week, we both predicted the exact scoreline with a 3-0 guess in the Newcastle United v Scunthorpe game. This week, as I speak, Newcastle United are playing Doncaster at the Keepmoat stadium and our predictions are as follows:</description>

      <description>Foolish, selfish, ridiculous, childish, stupid, outrageous and more than anything, arrogant. The Andy Carroll story. Reportedly he&amp;rsquo;s after breaking Steven Taylor&amp;rsquo;s jaw in a Sunday training session and I needn&amp;rsquo;t say anymore. Disgraceful from a Geordie born lad who was making great strides this season. Now however, his season is over as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned and he&amp;rsquo;ll be extremely lucky to remain a Newcastle United player too. This is just utterly disgraceful and nothing less.</description>

      <description>The next Javier Mascherano apparently but you just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust the people who says these things! Newcastle United have been linked with another player plying his trade in the sunny side of Europe. This time Fernando Alexandre is the man being linked with the Toon. A defensive midfielder naturally, he&amp;rsquo;s highly rated in Portugal and indeed is on-loan at Leixões at this current time . It&amp;rsquo;s believed that Graham Carr is taking a look at him, as well as host of other foreign talent.</description>

      <description>Juan Albin - Newcastle reportedly interested in this guys services I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that Newcastle United as a club haven&amp;rsquo;t had a great number of good buys from Spain the last ten or so years. The likes of Albert Luque spring to mind, and that £9.75m price-tag too. Today, the Sunday papers are at again and are reporting that we&amp;rsquo;re after Getafe&amp;rsquo;s Juan Albin and indeed Valencia&amp;rsquo;s promising Pablo Hernandez.</description>

The free-scoring Peter Lovenkrands is 50-50 to make Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s away trip to Bristol tomorrow after suffering a light ankle injury in Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s 3-0 win over Scunthorpe. The Dane who has been banging them in up-front alongside Andy Carroll has hit 11 goals in his last 12 appearances, a record any striker would be proud of. However, the Dane is also a doubt for tomorrows clash against Bristol City which will prove a very tough task too, especially at Ashton Gate.</description>

      <description>Ok, maybe it could be better. Perhaps lying in the top half of the Premier League table would be a better scenario but our current one isn&amp;rsquo;t far off. There&amp;rsquo;s major relief and indeed contentment around Tyneside as it seems we&amp;rsquo;re on our way back up to the Premier League following relegation from it last year. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, there&amp;rsquo;s still 10 games or so left, but surely we can&amp;rsquo;t throw away a 12 point lead from the automatic promotion spots away?</description>

      <description>For the third week running, we bring the tipping challenge of the century, between Tyne Time and one of the Worlds Leading Sports Psychics, Dean Midas Maynard. Last week we predicted a Newcastle United win away to Middlesbrough but neither of us gained any points because of the draw. I predicted a 1-3 Toon win so we got the four goals part right whereas Dean was spot on the exact amount of goals Newcastle United scored in the game.</description>

      <description>West Brom earned a very good win away to Paolo Sousa&amp;rsquo;s Swansea City today, something we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to manage, and it&amp;rsquo;s 3 points which could prove crucial to Roberto di Matteo&amp;rsquo;s promotion push with West Bromwich Albion. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the amount of times West Brom have won it in the dying minutes of matches but not only that, the sheer amount of penalties they seem to get along the way.</description>

      <description>Best - Only needs his first goal for the club and more will follow A lot of people have doubted the talent of Leon Best in the last few weeks and are concerned that he might have been a poor signing from Chris Hughton. Leon arrived on Tyneside in a dream move (for him) on the last day of the transfer window in January of this year. The former Coventry striker had scored reached double figures in the league with Coventry up until his move but he is yet to bag his first goal for Newcastle United in what&amp;rsquo;s been a very successful Coca Cola Championship campaign.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United seem to be catching on to the way a football club is run, and the youth policy is one of the more important. Newcastle have been linked with possible moves for Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s Tom Cleverly and now Lens attacker Adama Diakite. Diakite is pretty unknown and there&amp;rsquo;s very little information available on him online but what we do know is that he is a highly-rated youngster. Juventus tried to seal a deal for him in August and now, alongside us, Werder Bremen are rumoured to be firming up their interest in the 19 year-old.</description>

With Newcastle traveling to Middlesbrough tomorrow, Tyne Time continues it&amp;rsquo;s feature which see us put our wits up against one of the leading sports psychics in the world, Dean Midas Maynard. As mentioned in the previous weeks posts, Dean is quite a famous sports psychic and has worked with many football clubs.

Well it might not have been John Ruddy Chris Hughton and co. were looking at in their quest to Scotland a day ago I expected. instead, the attention has turned to their centre-back, Mark Reynolds. The Scottish defender is also rumoured to be attracting interest from Sam Allardyce&amp;rsquo;s Blackburn Rovers so whether that indicates what type of player he is, is another matter.</description>

      <description>There are reports emerging that Chris Hughton was in Scotland yesterday to watch John Ruddy play and keep tabs on the youngsters progress. The 23 year-old which is quite young for a keeper is on loan at Motherwell from Everton, with the hope he can finally over-take Time Howard between the sticks. If that&amp;rsquo;s hard enough, it&amp;rsquo;s a very long shot that he&amp;rsquo;ll outdo either the long-serving Steve Harper or indeed Time Krul and that&amp;rsquo;s before I even mention Fraser Forster.</description>

      <description>The recent performances of Danny Guthrie have been nothing short of fantastic as the former Liverpool midfielder continues to prove that he&amp;rsquo;s more of an asset in centre midfield. Guthrie scored twice on Saturday and both were from distance. He&amp;rsquo;s also got important goals this seasons like our home tie against West Brom, in the 2-2 draw. The forlorn figure of Joey Barton will reappear from Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s dressing-room in the next week or so but I can&amp;rsquo;t see him breaking into the Toon starting 11 straight away anyway.</description>

      <description>When Newcastle United in January 2009 confirmed that Peter Lovenkrands would indeed be staying until the end of the season under Joe Kinnear, there were a lot of unhappy Ton fans out there. In a dismal January transfer window which in a way sent us down from the Premier League, Lovenkrands was 1 of a mere 3 faces that arrived on a relegation threatened club at the time . He tried his best at Newcastle and score some important goals, like his goal away at West Brom and indeed sealing all 3 points in St.</description>

The attendances have been fantastic this season, putting many Premier League ones to shame including a club not very far from Newcastle. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of readers looking for highlights of the 6-1 mauling of Barnsley and you can&amp;rsquo;t really blame then.</description>

      <description>Gutierrez - A clearly delighted Toon supporter shows his delight at Jonas&amp;rsquo;s mask! We spoke about Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s free-scoring form at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park this season and it continued again today with Barnsley the victims. 6 goals scored and five of them in the second half, including a rare goal from former Real Zaragoza winger Jonas Gutierrez, and what a goal it was. Cutting in from the left wing, he ghosted past two Barnsley markers before floating it into the top corner off the backside of the crossbar.</description>

      <description>As Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s exciting season continues on the field, Tyne Time have teamed up with Dean &amp;lsquo;Midas&amp;rsquo; Maynard, one the worlds most renowned psychics who has many successes to date. Dean and myself have agreed to have a little challenge to see who&amp;rsquo;s predictions are most accurate for the remaining 13 Coca Cola Championship games. Obviously a lot of people will be skeptic of Dean&amp;rsquo;s abilities and I must say I&amp;rsquo;m not really a man into this kind of stuff but nevertheless, it interests me.</description>

      <description>Coloccini - Mike Williamson grateful of the Argentine&amp;rsquo;s help and experience It&amp;rsquo;s true to say Fabricio Coloccini has been a rock at the central of defence this season at Newcastle United and really, he&amp;rsquo;d want to be putting in a good shift after setting us back £10.3m in the &amp;lsquo;Keegan Summer&amp;rsquo;. Another centre-back who arrived on Tyneside this January by the name of Mike Williamson from troubled Portsmouth has also been sturdy at the heart of our defence, a position where we&amp;rsquo;ve lacked real quality throughout the years.</description>

      <description>Ashley - No plans to sell Newcastle United FC in the very near future He&amp;rsquo;s a man we&amp;rsquo;ve wanted out for a couple of years now. I do mention &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m sure every Newcastle United fan out there, young and old, saw what has happened since Mike Ashley took over. Relegation and so on, but let&amp;rsquo;s not get into that as it&amp;rsquo;s been discussed many a time before. There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article in the Telegraph today with Derek Llambias and indeed his &amp;amp; Mike&amp;rsquo;s stance on Newcastle United FC.</description>

      <description>A pretty decent February came to an end and we&amp;rsquo;re top of the Coca Cola Championship on-course for a Premier League return, which is the most important thing. A month which saw us score a lot at home and get back to winning ways, away from home. Next up we&amp;rsquo;ll have Barnsley visit St.James&amp;rsquo; Park and the last time we played these was away, in a 2-2 draw. We conceded in the dying minutes.</description>

      <description>O&amp;rsquo;Hara - A very good player and would be a great addition to Newcastle United There are usual reports in the papers about Portsmouth and their financial worries in the last few days and more than likely, Pompey will be a Coca Cola Championship club come May this year. It&amp;rsquo;s been a big drop for a club who only a couple of years ago lifted the FA Cup with Harry Redknapp in charge.</description>

      <description>A division down and a better looking Coca Cola Championship table. A better looking defence and a far better looking goal difference. However, don&amp;rsquo;t be entirely convinced, our players haven&amp;rsquo;t just found magical form this season. One man who has caught the eye of many is Fabricio Coloccini and his improved performances this season have been a welcome relief. Let&amp;rsquo;s not forget though, this guy cost £10.3m and at one stage, played every single game in the La Liga with Deportivo la Coruna.</description>

      <description>Colo - Scored today in a very big Newcastle United victory at Vicarage Road Three points and a job done. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to get back to winning ways away from home and thankfully the lads did indeed get their first three points outside St.James&amp;rsquo; Park since our victory at the Ricoh Arena those months ago. With West Brom winning at home to Derby County and Nottingham Forest suffering defeat to rivals Leicester City, it now means that we&amp;rsquo;re 6 points clear at the top of the table.</description>

      <description>Every game from now until May is of huge importance to Newcastle United and our promotion hopes. The laughing stock of English football last year, we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get a modest manager, and eventually managed to get some much needed faces in January, something that played a big factor in sending us down last season. Now however, we&amp;rsquo;re no longer the main club that&amp;rsquo;s subject to a huge amount of jokes.</description>

      <description>Aanholt - Would be nice to keep this lad at Newcastle United for another while In what was a busy January transfer window for Newcastle United, we saw Newcastle sign Patrick van Aanholt from Chelsea on-loan for the injured Jose Enrique. It was a quick move by Hughton to replace Jose and I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair say that Patrick has done very well at Newcastle United in his time here.</description>

      <description>Chris - Different type of manager who keeps to himself and gets on with the job Top of the Coca Cola Championship and pretty much a healthy squad with very little injuries. This is a line you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t associate with Newcastle United too often but it&amp;rsquo;s the story of our season so far. 12 goals in our last 3 at home and our strikers scoring with ease, for now anyway.</description>

      <description>Mike - Love him or loath him he&amp;rsquo;s kept NUFC in a financially stable condition You only have to look at Portsmouth FC to see what the economic recession is doing to football. Stoke City&amp;rsquo;s 1-2 win against Avram Grant&amp;rsquo;s side was rumoured to have been the last ever game played in Fratton Park, however whether this is true or not, I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Either way, Pompey are in a serious financial mess at the minute and the signs for the future are not good at all.</description>

      <description>Lovenkrands - Limped off against Preston N.E but not out for too long we hope Some people say it was the injuries that sent Newcastle United down to the Coca Cola Championship last year but this time around, we&amp;rsquo;re hoping it&amp;rsquo;s the lack of injuries that send us back up to the Premier League. The amount of injuries we had at one stage of the season couldn&amp;rsquo;t be counted on two hands and that&amp;rsquo;s never a good sign.</description>

      <description>Iwelumo - Scored the first goal in Bristol City&amp;rsquo;s comeback against West Brom The beauty of the Coca Cola Championship where every team can beat each other. Known more for his horrific yet hilarious miss against Norway a year ago, Chris Iwelumo today scored Bristol City&amp;rsquo;s equalizer and their first goal in what proved to be a very pleasing comeback from Gary Johnson&amp;rsquo;s men. For us, it&amp;rsquo;s a very important win and indeed for Nottingham Forest&amp;rsquo;s promotion hopes too.</description>

After Peter Lovenkrands fortuitous opener, Kevin Nolan&amp;rsquo;s 12th of the season the sub came off the bench to score again, and a decent goal it was. Leon Best too played his part, again falling over and leaving it to the former Wigan Athletic man.</description>

      <description>In a season that has saw our owner Mike Ashley try to sell but failing miserably yet again, however finally deciding to establish a tad of stability at the club. By that, it meant selling players, keeping some and after a long debacle as to who would be the full-time manager of Newcastle United, appointing Chris Hughton the former assistant of Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer (alongside Iain Dowie). Hughton has since guided us to a pretty decent season so far which sees us top of the Coca Cola Championship, as we enter the final stages of what&amp;rsquo;s been a long season, and it&amp;rsquo;s still not over.</description>

Using my fantastic mathematical brain(!) I&amp;rsquo;ve calculated that, the average amount of goals scored in our last two encounters is 4.5, with Wayne Routledge&amp;rsquo;s goal counting as the extra half :D.</description>

      <description>Well it does feel good to stay top of the table and even better to score four goals against a pretty decent Coventry City team. In what was a must-win game ( which ones aren&amp;rsquo;t? ) the lads truly delivered. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t start the best, and it took us a little while to get into the game, we eventually got a grasp on the game and didn&amp;rsquo;t loosen our grip on it once we scored.</description>

With Newcastle playing tomorrow at home to Coventry City the three points will mean even more, should we be able to get them.</description>

      <description>Our point against Swansea City on Saturday may have had some people questioning it&amp;rsquo;s value, but looking at the Coca Cola Championship it means a whole lot to the title hopes of Newcastle United FC. A last gasp header from Andy Carroll saw us return home from the Liberty Stadium aloft the table again, but only just. Later that day as you all know by now, Nottingham Forest lost to Doncaster making it a second defeat in a row following their loss at The Ricoh Arena, in Coventry.</description>

The questions are really mounting about Newcastle United and whether we&amp;rsquo;ll throw our promotion hopes out the window. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous to say we&amp;rsquo;re slipping up as this is our first defeat in 15 games in the league, albeit a big defeat. The pairing at the back yesterday of Mike Williamson and Fitz Hall were brilliant against Cardiff one Friday last, but just couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep out Rob Hulse and co.</description>

      <description>This could be a very costly loss for Newcastle United. However, it could very well turn out to be a beneficial lesson for Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s men although you might be led to believe otherwise. Rob Hulse, Kris Commons and one of their CB&amp;rsquo;s all scored and put Newcastle United to bed at Pride Park tonight. What frustrates us all is the fact we beat our promotion rivals 5-1 less than a week ago and we go to a mediocre Championship side and end up going out without a whimper.</description>

      <description>Derby - Have a very good record against Newcastle United in the last five years I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say we all remember our encounters with Derby County in the last 5 years. Especially our games against the Rams under Sam Allardyce which saw us go to Pride Park on a cold Monday night and get beaten 1-0 thanks to a Kenny Miller wondergoal and then their trip to St.</description>

      <description>Edmundsson - Signs on loan from B68 Toftir for the remainder of the season I must say the Sunday Papers have been pretty quiet today, it seems as if they&amp;rsquo;re all too caught up in the John Terry scandal to produce any &amp;lsquo;interesting&amp;rsquo; rumours surrounding us Magpies. Newcastle in the last couple of days have reportedly signed Joan Simun Edmundsson from B68 Toftir on-loan for the rest of the season.</description>

      <description>Hughton - Doing a very professional job at Newcastle United this season As expected for some, we&amp;rsquo;re top of the Coca Cola Championship and so far so good for Newcastle United. In less that 12 months after we plummeted into the Coca Cola Championship without a whimper, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a fair few &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; players leave the clubs and leave behind them, their big wages. Michael Owen, Obafemi Martins, Mark Viduka, Habib Beye, Damien Duff and many more left, as Newcastle United prepared for their first season in the lower tier of English football, in 16 years.</description>

      <description>Lovenkrands - Came off the bench to score twice including a beauty on his left First of all, I was very wrong in my predictions about tonights game. Very wrong indeed. In what was a totally one sided affair from the very first whistle, Newcastle United fired 5 goals past Dave Jones side. An early opener from Andy Carroll followed by an unfortunate turn of events which saw Gyepes put the ball into his own net, with Andy Carroll again to thank.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about the importance of tomorrows game and I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that it could be a momentous win, should we manage to grab all three points against Dave Jones men. Chris Hughton is under slight pressure for the first time all season and a negative result tomorrow will throw the title race open to a lot more than just Forest, Brom &amp;amp; us. Cardiff have over come their bad patch which saw them go four nil up against Peterborough before throwing it away and settling for a draw.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no lie to say that our clash with Cardiff City on Friday could prove the most important game we&amp;rsquo;ve played all season. I know every game is important and match with West Brom at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park only a few weeks ago was too a momentous clash. However, there&amp;rsquo;s even more on the line in our upcoming fixture against Dave Jones men. Cardiff in flying form of late and Michael Chopra&amp;rsquo;s back to scoring ways, not to even mention Peter Whittingham who has been fantastic for the Blue Birds this season.</description>

      <description>Best - Some Toon fans concerned at the signing of Leon by Chris Hughton It seems if a lot of Newcastle United fans have already formed opinions on our new signing, Irish international Leon Best. Having watched Best on many occasions, although he&amp;rsquo;s no Alan Shearer he certainly has the potential as Hughton rightly said, to make a good striker. Signing from Coventry for a rumoured fee of 650k, Best was Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s deadline day signing , getting in a striker after missing our on Victor Moses.</description>

      <description>Wayne Routledge was a good signing for Newcastle United  Routledge - Arrived on Tyneside for £1m in a successful transfer period  6 signings, no last minute stuff, and the majority for less than £1m. Mike Williamson, Danny Simpson, Wayne Routledge, Fitz Hall, Patrick van Aanholt and Leon Best all arrived at Newcastle in this January transfer window. 4 permanent signings, two loan deals. With Jose Enrique injured, Patrick van Aanholt has shown very promising signs in the Black and White shirt, and it seems as if he&amp;rsquo;s a very similar player to Jose, which is always a good find.</description>

      <description>Best - Takes the #20 shirt and Newcastle finish up their market activity This time last year we anxiously awaited the possible signing of Michael Johnson from Manchester City but we were left empty handed, with only Kevin Nolan &amp;amp; Ryan Taylor to show for our troubles, in what proved to be a disastrous January transfer window. Now though, a year on, we&amp;rsquo;ve signed Wayne Routledge, Mike Williamson, Patrick van Aanholt, Fitz Hall, Danny Simpson and now, Leon Best from Coventry City.</description>

      <description>Hughton - Disappointed over missing out on Moses and rightly so News is rife that Wigan Athletic has completed the signing of promising English talent Victor Moses from Crystal Palace for a fee of £2.5m. The Nigerian born was heavily linked with a move for Moses, however the Magpies were unwilling to match the administrators asking price of £2.5m which could turn out to be a great bargain in the future.</description>

      <description>Derby County proved a tough test for us earlier this year but so too for Billy Davies men with Nottingham Forest losing one nil away to The Rams today. A decisive Rob Hulse goal secured all three points and in that relieving victory both Derby County and Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s Coca Cola Championship campaigns were given a boost. Although West Brom beat Sheffield United today it means we can stretch the lead from Forest if we can manage to overcome a resilient Leicester City side tonight.</description>

      <description>Hall - Good to some depth on the defensive side of things with Fitz It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I can say I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the transfer window. This time last year we signed Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor. Today we signed another two players in Fitz Hall &amp;amp; Patrick van Aanholt, to add to our 3 signings already. Although they&amp;rsquo;re only two loan signings, they&amp;rsquo;re our players for a while and that&amp;rsquo;s the most important.</description>

      <description>Moses - Would be a great signing from Chris if we could manage to pull it off You have to credit Chris Hughton since taking over this summer. Not only are we top of the table, playing generally well, but for the first time in a while, we&amp;rsquo;ve secured 3 transfer signings in a couple of weeks. This is very good news and encouraging stuff to say the least. With Danny Simpson, Wayne Routledge and Mike Williamson already confirmed Newcastle United players , theres strong reports that Brimingham&amp;rsquo;s Martin Taylor could be next on Tyneside.</description>

      <description>Ranger - Netted again tonight as we saw Routledge &amp;amp; Williamson in action Tonights affair was a game we needed all three points from and the lads duly delivered the goods. In what was a Crystal Palace team without one of their main men in Victor Moses saw them concede within twenty minutes, a Shaun Derry O.G. In fairness, it seems as if Palace gave it a real go and could well have got something out of the game on another day.</description>

      <description>Routledge - a Very good signing for the Toon Army is you ask me It&amp;rsquo;s surprise news to say the least to hear that Newcastle have signed Wayne Routledge from QPR today and very good news if you ask me. The winger has signed a reported 3 and a half deal on Tyneside and for a fee of £1m, which if true, is very good value. Routledge as you might remember was a Tottenham and Villa former and an exciting winger.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s being reported tonight that Mike Williamson has signed finally, for Newcastle United. The Portsmouth CB has supposedly signed on a 3-year deal for a fee of £1.2m. As well as this, according to Sky Sports, we could well make a move for Malmo&amp;rsquo;s Edward Ofere. As we reported in October of last year, Chris Hughton could well have the tall striker on his shortlist, and a list that&amp;rsquo;s getting shorter every day too I&amp;rsquo;m sure.</description>

      <description>Andrews - Reportedly wanted by Chris Hughton to bolster midfield The Sunday Papers are at it again per usual. Today they again threw up some tasty yet laughable rumours which you love to hate. The latest, is that Chris Hughton is looking to strengthen the midfield up, with Keith Andrews his preferred target. I must say, being an Irishman and seeing Andrews play internationally, he&amp;rsquo;s nothing special. Far from it actually, he&amp;rsquo;s a typical Sam Allardyce player, works hard and tackles hard.</description>

      <description>Dorrans - Lethal from the penalty spot today as Brom progress to the next round I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t our best performance all season today at the Hawthorns, and when Jonas Olsson was again the first scorer you knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be our day. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I saw the match but updates on nufc.co.uk got me through the feisty affair. Pre-match I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too concerned if were going to be knocked out or not but of course I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have minded a victory away to one our promotion rivals.</description>

      <description>Pompey - A real mess at that club right now both financially and on the fields After successfully completing a medical on Tyneside, Mike Williamson was expected to secure a £1m transfer to Newcastle today. However, some late checks on the contract by Pompey have resulted in them finding a snag or a little clause that they had forgot about. Sky Sports (who else?) reported that the deal had indeed been stalled after the club found the clause and they want Newcastle United to pay it.</description>

The arrival of Danny Simpson was confirmed yesterday and Sky Sports revealed tonight that Mike Williamson will enter talks with Newcastle United following our bid was accepted for the 6&amp;rsquo;4 defender. Mike Williamson arrived at Fratton Park for a initial fee of £2m, a transfer fee that could&amp;rsquo;ve rose to £5m if he had played a certain amount of games for the club.</description>

A little reading around brought me to this issue and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure if there&amp;rsquo;s any truth in it. Fitz Hall was linked last year and came close to a move if sources are to be believed, however it was wage demands that scuppered any possible switch to St.</description>

      <description>Perch - A more than decent defender who Forest want to keep The breaking news is, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve heard is that we&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to sign someone, and in the shape of Danny Simpson. The Manchester United former joins for a reported fee of £500k and on £10,000 a week wages, which if true, is very very good value. On top of that, if the wage figure that&amp;rsquo;s being thrown about the place is accurate then I wonder what all the confusion was about?</description>

      <description>How suiting it was that Peter Lovenkrands had the last say in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park last night in what was a very exciting affair. Tyne Time predicted a 2-0 scoreline in Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s favour and we were wrong, however I did guarantee an even encounter, one which if you ask me, we didn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to win. The opening minutes saw West Brom throw the kitchen sink at Newcastle and they got their due reward when Olsson delicately flicked Dorran&amp;rsquo;s ball beyond the despairing Steve Harper.</description>

      <description>Lads - A good performance tonight should secure a precious 3 points Around this time last year Newcastle were looking into potential fixtures that would bring them up the table and secure safety. This time around, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at our game at home to West Bromich Albion as key match where the Coca Cola Championship will take a huge step in churning out winners and promotion candidates with Newcastle hopefully finishing aloft the table come</description>

      <description>Beckford - Staying at Leeds until the end of the season to help promotion bid There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of disappointed Newcastle United fans out there today at the news Leeds United&amp;rsquo;s Jermaine Beckford will remain at Leeds United and try aid their promotion charge. A two nil away loss to Exeter City yesterday I&amp;rsquo;m sure played a certain part in his decision and there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt Leeds do really need the the striker.</description>

      <description>Simpson - The deal is not totally dead according to reports Newcastle fans are describing the transfer of Danny Simpson as one of the most important steps Chris Hughton will take this season. The Manchester United RB has been on-loan since last year and has impressed the Geordie fans with his performances and especially, his attitude. However, the move has stalled because of Danny&amp;rsquo;s wage demands. As I wrote yesterday, NUFC supposedly have a wage-cap for the Coca Cola Championship campaign in place, and Simpson&amp;rsquo;s desired wage packet stretches beyond the limit.</description>

      <description>Do excuse the title. It was rather irresistible although probably just a little terrible all the same. Anyway, if the rumours are accurate and the many of them, Danny Simpson will return to Manchester United in the next few days. This comes as his contract talks with Chris Hughton &amp;amp; co. have resulted in the full-back demanding too much per-week, as listed in the &amp;lsquo;Newcastle United Coca Championship rule book&amp;rsquo;. As well as this it seems as if Matthew Kilgallon will wait until the summer to leave Sheffield United and Everton is his most likely destination now.</description>

      <description>Sky Sports are reporting that Bolton&amp;rsquo;s Danny Shittu could well arrive on Tyneside on a loan deal until the end of the season. The Nigerian hasn&amp;rsquo;t really had much of a look in at the Reebok and with the arrival of Owen Coyle, Newcastle are hopeful they can borrow the 6&amp;rsquo;2 centre half. Just in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know too much about him, he&amp;rsquo;s 29 years of age, a Nigerian international and has played for a fair few clubs in his time.</description>

He arrived from Liverpool after conceding he couldn&amp;rsquo;t break the first team or compete with the &amp;lsquo;brilliance&amp;rsquo; of Steven Gerrard. Well after arriving from Anfield Guthrie had a mixed start on Tyneside, he broke Craig Fagan&amp;rsquo;s leg before scoring a scorcher against Portsmouth in a memorable victory.Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s be little in the way of media interaction with Danny Guthrie.</description>

      <description>Chris Hughton has today again reiterated his stance on Jermaine Beckford&amp;rsquo;s transfer scenario. Hughton has made it no secret that he&amp;rsquo;s after the 6&amp;rsquo;2 striker but insists that he&amp;rsquo;ll neither heighten his price, or be forced to do so. It&amp;rsquo;s believed that Newcastle have issued Leeds with an ultimatum, a bid of just about £2m, a take it or leave it offer for the Elland Road outfit. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that Beckford wants to join Newcastle and has even issued a transfer request to speed up his move away from Leeds if possible.</description>

      <description>The speculation goes on. Just as it seemed Jermaine Beckford was joining Newcastle United this January, the tale has taken another twist. It&amp;rsquo;s now reported that Sunderland and Wolves have both joined the race to sign the FA Cup hero as Leeds United stall over Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s latest bid. Sources suggested that Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s latest bid was indeed rejected but no one knows for sure. Apparently The Elland Road outfit are holding out for £2m for Beckford but most of the teams know that his contract expires in only a few months time.</description>

      <description>One of our readers asked the question whether recalling Francisco Jiménez Tejada or more commonly known as Xisco, could solve Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s continuing forward problems. We&amp;rsquo;ve been constantly linked with Jermaine Beckford but most have forgotten our own player Xisco, who is still on the books at Newcastle United. Although on loan at Racing Santander at the minute, I&amp;rsquo;d be pretty confident there&amp;rsquo;s a clause in his contract which allows us to recall him at anytime from his loan in Spain.</description>

      <description>Most of news today has been dominated by Michael Chopra and a possible move back to Newcastle. Whilst everything&amp;rsquo;s been pretty quiet overall the Sunday Sun always tend to cook something up that makes for interesting reading. I think we all remember the day in the Stadium Of Light when after starting the 2nd half one nil down due to a Justin Hoyte goal, Newcastle fought back and romped to a 4-1 hammering.</description>

      <description>All the talk in the last few weeks has been about the likes of Matthew Kilgallon and Jermaine Beckford arriving on Tyneside. Today has been pretty quiet on the Toon front with the real focus on the snow, the other games in the Championship. We saw Cardiff City draw 1-1 at home to Ian Holloway&amp;rsquo;s Blackpool &amp;amp; Scunthorpe put four past a Derby County side which proved an equal match for us a week ago.</description>

      <description>All the talk surrounding Newcastle United this last week has been about their transfer targets Jermaine Beckford &amp;amp; Matthew Kilgallon. However, with our game with Reading at the Madejski Stadium called off due to the heavy snow, all the focus was on tonights game at the Hawthorns. In what was a rumbustious display from Nottingham Forest, they ran out 1-3 winners against a West Brom side looking to close the gap on us to three points.</description>

As he&amp;rsquo;s in his last few months of his contract at Bramall Lane, Kilgallon will seek a move in the summer for free, and to a Premier League club if he can.</description>

In possibly the shortest interview I&amp;rsquo;ve even read, Beckford simply said he would be joining Newcastle United and nothing else.

      <description>Sky Sports are reporting within the last hour that Chris Hughton may well make a move for PSG&amp;rsquo;s Jérôme Rothen. The winger, who is on loan at Rangers is meant to have caught the eye of Hughton in the last while. Speaking earlier today Hughton, who has been in good contact with the media, said he is very confident that his transfer targets will arrive this January, and maybe sooner than later.</description>

      <description>Beckford - Clearly wants a move this January transfer window I think the next day or two will bring down the curtains on what has been a 2 year old love affair between Newcastle United and Jermaine Beckford. The Keegan, Kinnear, Shearer and now Hughton target has today handed a transfer request to the Elland Road hierarchy underlining his ambitions to leave Leeds United. After scoring the winner at Old Trafford amongst 19 other goals this year, Chris Hughton is clearly in the hunt for the 6&amp;rsquo;2 striker and I&amp;rsquo;d expect a move to materialize within the next 48 hours.</description>

Chris Hughton will now have to readjust his January transfer target and his main man, Matthew Kilgallon has said today that he&amp;rsquo;s staying put at Sheffield United. Kilgallon, who was expected to make the move to us this January has opted to try and push for promotion with the Blades and reassess his options in the summer. In fairness, you&amp;rsquo;ve to credit the lad there, he wants to stay and hopefully achieve promotion with manager Kevin Blackwell.</description>

      <description>As the speculation mounts about Jermaine Beckford, alongside the price, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a look at other players that Newcastle United should really consider making inquiries for. All the media hype has been about Matthew Kilgallon &amp;amp; Jermaine Beckford and I&amp;rsquo;m sure about 96% of my articles this new year are revolved around the Sheffield United centre half and the Leeds United hitman. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s many players out there vying for a move to Newcastle and below I&amp;rsquo;ve put together three players which I think would be worth a shot at St.</description>

      <description>Beckford - Not worth more than £2.5m this January transfer window Fair enough, he scored the winner against Manchester United in the FA Cup a few days ago, granted he&amp;rsquo;s got 20 goals for Leeds United already and we&amp;rsquo;re just leaving Christmas but Jermaine Beckford isn&amp;rsquo;t worth the £3m Leeds United are reportedly looking for. With Newcastle expected to sign Beckford soon after submitting another, written transfer bid, it would be a risky transfer if we ssplashed out near four million pounds on a League 1 striker.</description>

However, the goalposts have moved pricewise, as you would have expected. Our original bid of £1.</description>

      <description>Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being a little too harsh, but another FA Cup tie isn&amp;rsquo;t top of my wish list this new year. A 0-0 draw away to Plymouth Argyle means that the Green Army will make yet another trip to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park in the new year. In an affair that Nicky Butt nearly settled in the dying moments with a stinging volley, just wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be and it meant that Plymouth earned another shout at progressing in the FA Cup, in one of the biggest stadiums in England.</description>

Kilgallon, as well as Beckford are in the final months of their respective contracts and Chris Hughton is hoping to get a bargain on both of them.</description>

However, the man who served time in prison for beating the daylights out of a youngster in Liverpool a while back, has today spoke out against modern day footballers who are living the dream so to speak. Speaking, he said that most footballers are &amp;lsquo;knobs&amp;rsquo; and think that their extreme wealth will continue forever.</description>

      <description>### Beckford - Is he really worth the hassle of luring to Toon?
It&amp;rsquo;s no lie to say that Jermaine Beckford is probably the best striker in League 1 albeit closely followed by Grant Holt of Norwich City. Racking up 16 goals to date, Beckford of course is attracting interest from beyond League 1 and our very own Newcastle United have been linked many a time with the 6&amp;rsquo;2 London born striker.</description>

      <description>### Savage - Always looking to upset an opponents rhythm
With West Brom leading away to Scunthorpe as I write this post, the importance of our game against Derby County at 5.30 has doubled. No longer are we 10 points clear at the top, indeed it will be a lot closer than that if West Brom win at Scunny. Not only are Brom closing the gap but Cardiff City who are four goals to the good away to Peterborough, are finding themselves in the hierarchy of the playoffs yet again.</description>

      <description>The Sunday Sun are reporting that Real Madrid could well be lining up a move for Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Fabricio Coloccini after Pepe&amp;rsquo;s injury has proven to be a serious one, and will keep the Portuguese international out of action for months to come. In fairness to Coloccini, he&amp;rsquo;s being doing well this season as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, especially from a £10.3m signing who played in the Champions League only a few years back.</description>

      <description>Barton - Will he miss the crucial tie with West Brom? Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m looking into things just a little too much but it&amp;rsquo;s occurred to me, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure it has to you, that West Bromich Albion are hot on the tails of Newcastle in the Coca Cola Championship. Today, we were a little lacklustre in midfield and missed Alan Smith. Nicky Butt played well in many periods of the game but in fairness to the man, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be first choice in the middle of the park.</description>

      <description>Another Kevin Nolan goal and indeed another one from Shola Ameobi. Still wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough though. After 90 minutes of grueling and rumbustious play, it was yet again the home side that had the last laugh, with James O&amp;rsquo;Connor poking home in very controversial circumstances. Enough about that though, we were rusty today and in the end, not good enough to take home the three points on offer. Saying that, all credit to Sheffield Wednesday, they hadn&amp;rsquo;t scored in quite a while and needed to pick up form sooner rather then later, a draw with the leaders will no doubt do the trick.</description>

As you know it&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Eve and tomorrow is Christmas day. Tyne Time would like to wish all it&amp;rsquo;s readers and every Geordie in the world, from Brazil to Australia, a very very Happy Christmas. I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of things have happened since the last time Christmas was celebrated, some good, some bad. However, for Newcastle United, things have marginally picked up. 10 points clear at the top of the Coca Cola Championship and stability at once is seems.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s some unbelievable news regarding Newcastle United today, Managing Director Derek Llambias has confirmed that Chris Hughton will be given cash to spend on new players if he needs. Ok, it mightn&amp;rsquo;t be that unbelievable but it might come as a surprise to some fans. Speaking today, Llambias said that Chris will be supported in the January transfer window by Mike Ashley and that it will be Chris&amp;rsquo;s own players that arrive at the club, if any players happen to arrive at all.</description>

      <description>### Beevers - Highly rated in English Football
It&amp;rsquo;s being reported, and not for the first time, that Newcastle United could well be taking a look at Sheffield Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s Mark Beevers. The defender who is a big 6&amp;rsquo;5 is meant to be attracting a lot of interest in not only the Championship, but also in the Premier League. Beevers received Player of the Season at Wednesday last year if memory serves me correct,and is only 20 years of age, and with a huge amount of potential if reports are accurate.</description>

I needn&amp;rsquo;t remind you of that terrible terrible day in Villa Park in late May last, when the history of Newcastle United FC hit the lowest of the low. Relegation sounded, as Hull City celebrated staying afloat in the Premier League. There&amp;rsquo;s no point saying we deserved to stay up because we didn&amp;rsquo;t. However, if we&amp;rsquo;d a decent owner then of course we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been in the spot we were in , or indeed in the Championship as we are now.</description>

      <description>Another three points and another win against Middlesbrough. Well done Chris Hughton and well done the lads. In rather chilly conditions in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park, Marlon Harewood &amp;amp; Shola Ameobi both netted to ensure that we will have a happy Christmas period with a ten point gap between ourselves and West Bromich Albion. Although the game started quite slowly and perhaps Boro having the better spell of possession, it was Marlon Harewood who latched on to a Shola Ameobi knock-down to slide the ball home and bring his tally to 5 this season.</description>

      <description>Kilgallon - Moving clubs in January if he can Sheffield United boss Kevin Blackwell has confirmed today that his prominent centre-back Matthew Kilgallon, will leave the club in the January transfer period. Kilgallon, who is highly rated in both the Championship &amp;amp; the Premier League will look for a new club after no agreement could be made on a new deal at Bramall Lane. Chris Hughton earlier this year expressed an interest in the former Leeds CB, but the likes of Hull City have also been linked to making an offer for the lad.</description>

OK, we might not attract Alexandre Pato to St.James&amp;rsquo; Park but we certainly do hope that new faces arrive on Tyneside this January. I know a lot of you&amp;rsquo;ll will immediately play down our chances of signing anyone good permanently you just never know, we might be surprised this Christmas period, although I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. Reports emerged today that Ashley could hand Chris Hughton a possible £6m transfer kitty, and that Adam Hammill is on Hughton&amp;rsquo;s wish-list.</description>

      <description>Harewood - Doing quite well for Newcastle of late You can&amp;rsquo;t fault Marlon Harewood&amp;rsquo;s efforts lately for Newcastle, actually far from it. The striker has scored a few goals and is working hard and moreso, for the team. Arriving on loan from Villa, Harewood didn&amp;rsquo;t establish himself as a very gracious striker or very skillful, indeed it&amp;rsquo;s lucky that Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s spoke to him or we might not we debating whether we&amp;rsquo;d like him back or not at all.</description>

      <description>### Wilshere - Linked with Newcastle loan move in January
The rumour mill is dusting off it&amp;rsquo;s hinges and getting going again. Of course you could say it never stops at Newcastle above any other club. Today reports bring the story that Arsenal starlet Jack Wilshere will possibly make a loan switch to Newcastle United in the forthcoming January transfer window. This news comes as Arsene Wenger declared that Wilshere is available for loan and may indeed join a &amp;lsquo;top Championship club&amp;rsquo; and somehow I don&amp;rsquo;t think he means Ipswich Town.</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good year for North-East football last year for sure, with us and Middlesbrough taking the drop to the Coca Cola Championship and Sunderland just about surviving the final few pressurizing games. In a game we needed to win and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about Aston Villa and that day but rather of the game at home to Middlesbrough where we got what many people thought was the three points which would&amp;rsquo;ve kept us up.</description>

      <description>Newcastle today rued the chance to go ten points clear at the top of the Coca Cola Championship table with a 2-2 draw away to Barnsley. In a game that saw us lead twice and conceded an equaliser with 3 minutes left, from a corner was a bitter pill to swallow for some Toon players and especially the 7,000 travelling fans. The fans who made the trip were hoping for an eight win in a row but it didn&amp;rsquo;t come thanks to B.</description>

Newcastle are doing well and a man by the name of Chris Hughton is doing his job very well indeed. When Hughton&amp;rsquo;s name was mentioned with the permanent role as manager, a lot of people would&amp;rsquo;ve rather to have had Ruud Gullit back than Chris, but how that has changed.</description>

Money, women and the many other commodities of modern footballers has saw many of them fail to make the cut in football with their respective clubs. Not because of a lack of talent but because of a lack of maturity and responsibility, some thing that comes with age.</description>

The icing on the cake came with only a few minutes remaining, Enrique crossing for his second assist of the evening before Ranger, between two defenders prodded it home. Hopefully this goal, which has been a long time coming, will spur on a huge goal fest.</description>

Whether this story is made up or not I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure but I could honestly see Harper between the sticks for England, and perhaps a long time coming.</description>

First things first, this is news to me, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many other Toon fans. This is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve been linked to this winger but it&amp;rsquo;s rumoured that Chris Hughton was having a look at him all that time, or supposedly so. Although I for one have heard very little of this guy he&amp;rsquo;s highly rated at Charlton and in League 1 it seems, with a whole host of other Championship clubs looking to avail of his services.</description>

      <description>News is emerging from the ever unreliable News Of The World, that Mike Ashley is contemplating selling the club, in January. However, I find that a little hard to believe considering we lie top of the Championship, have a huge amount of players and their hefty wages shipped off the wage bill and seem to be actually enjoying our football at the minute. Of course meaning that should we continue our good form until May, then Newcastle United will be a Premier League team, the clubs value will have doubled and so will it&amp;rsquo;s revenues.</description>

Speaking today after a 2-0 home win against Watford in which saw new boy Fabrice Pancrate get his first in the Black and White Hughton said that tougher games await and that Lady Luck won&amp;rsquo;t shine on them as brightly as she has.</description>

      <description>Robert - Worth another shot at Newcastle? I think we all remember those good old days when Alan Shearer and Laurent Robert tore defences apart and progressed up the league. Those days have gone though, and many of those great players have left the club. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that Laurent Robert was a special footballer and Bobby Robson saw this too. Although Sir Bobby wasn&amp;rsquo;t keen on paying big fees for his players, the chairman insisted and Robert was on Tyneside before too long.</description>

      <description>### Hughton - Not buying a truck load of players this Jan
Chris Hughton may be after a couple of players in January but he&amp;rsquo;s intent on not breaking the harmony within the Newcastle United squad at the minute. Or in simple English &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t fix it, if it&amp;rsquo;s not broken&amp;rsquo; and how right it is. We currently lie top of the Coca Cola Championship table as we enter a busy Christmas period.</description>

      <description>### Kilgallon - Hull have moved in alongside Newcastle for the CB
Well it seems my latest article caused quite a lot of controversy and perhaps it was just a little too harsh on Birmingham City. They&amp;rsquo;re doing well in the Premier League and Toon old boys Stephen Carr &amp;amp; Lee Bowyer seem to be enjoying their football at St.Andrews. Long may it last but I still believe that they&amp;rsquo;ll be fighting it out for survival come April/ May, then again, that&amp;rsquo;s only my opinion.</description>

      <description>### Smith - Neither of the lads would leave Tyneside this January
Although the headline might sound a little disrespectful to Birmingham, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean it that way. However, both of the lads have said that they don&amp;rsquo;t want a move away from Newcastle and for me, that&amp;rsquo;s that. Smith and Nolan both joined for decent fees and haven&amp;rsquo;t lived up to their price tag. Even though Nolan &amp;amp; Smith have looked pretty comfortable this season so far, you&amp;rsquo;d expect that as they&amp;rsquo;re playing a division below their usual standard.</description>

      <description>When it comes to players at Newcastle, who are knuckling down and attempting to get the job done, then Jose Enrique is certainly in the top five. The Spaniard who moved to Newcastle from Villareal for a hefty £6.3m fee failed to impress in his first season, under Big Sam. However, although people got on his back and labelled him as an accident waiting to happen, Enrique showed last season and indeed this season of what he&amp;rsquo;s capable of.</description>

      <description>Despite having a torrid first season in the Premier League and indeed becoming the laughing stock of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s leaky defence, it seems that Fabricio Coloccini still had offers on the table for his services. Saying that, I&amp;rsquo;d expect that there was offers but ones of a laughable amount, and we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too keen on seeing him go for pennies considering we paid over £10m for him last summer. Declaring himself very unhappy at Newcastle on many an occasion you were almost certain that Colo would move away from the Toon, be it on loan or permanent, however, after collecting the MOTM award on Saturday, I doubt he&amp;rsquo;ll be going anywhere any time soon.</description>

      <description>A former Sunderland striker today secured a vital win for Roy Keane and his Ipswich Town side but also helped Newcastle United as well as a couple of other teams. After the defeat, it now leaves Cardiff in 7th, 12 points off Newcastle and Ipswich are now off the bottom of the table, leaping above Peterborough. What&amp;rsquo;s more is that we&amp;rsquo;ve played Cardiff City at theirs and you might remember that Fabricio Coloccini scored the winner in that hard fought game.</description>

      <description>Reports today claim that Chris Hughton is looking at Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s Tom Cleverley. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the tabloids combined have managed nearly five articles on Newcastle alone but if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind if this rumour is true. Cleverly who is on loan with Watford has showed glimpses of why he is indeed with Manchester United. So far, he&amp;rsquo;s played 14 games, scored 5 goals and had 4 assists.</description>

      <description>Ashley - Beginning to take some responsibility? I know it might be a tough question to ask and one that will have a common answer but it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking a look at this issue all the same. Although we haven&amp;rsquo;t heard much about, from or to him of late, it seems as if Mike Ashley has settled down just a little bit. Ashley who took us off the market for a second time earlier this season because he failed to sell, is slowly but surely eeking a possible title of a football club owner.</description>

      <description>Sheffield United have today rejected an approach from an unnamed club for their prominent centre half, Matthew Kilgallon. This club is believed to be Newcastle United, especially after Chris Hughton confirmed that he was in the hunt for the 27 year old who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to run on his current contract at the Blades. Today however, Sheffield&amp;rsquo;s manager Kevin Blackwell has turned down the &amp;lsquo;inquiry&amp;rsquo; claiming that the offer wasn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient and that he hopes he can really keep hold of the York born defender until the end of the season at least.</description>

      <description>Reports are emerging of late that David Moyes is looking yet again, at Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s prominent centre back, Steven Taylor. Moyes, who was present at the Preston North End game on Monday has been after Taylor for many a season now if reports are to believed. Now it seems, with Moyes huge injury problems (sound familiar?) is looking to bolster his squad, and especially his defence. That&amp;rsquo;s all good and well, but the real question remains, will Stevie Taylor himself leave the club, or indeed be allowed to?</description>

      <description>Yesterday Newcastle again fought their way to a victory in rather undesirable conditions, in Deepdale. Kevin Nolan turned in his 9th goal of the season and again leads the scoring charts. From the first whistle, it was a game that could go either way but the further the game progressed, you just felt that a goal was coming for the Toon. Indeed it did come, and it quite a tasty goal to say the least.</description>

Chris Hughton and the lads will attempt to reclaim top spot and in order to do that, they&amp;rsquo;ll need to crack the tough challenge of Preston, in Deepdale. Although Preston lie in 12th position they&amp;rsquo;ve won 3 at home and 3 on the trot.</description>

      <description>I suppose a lot of you are wondering who this guy really is, and to be honest, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a whole lot of information out there about him. Two things we do know is that he&amp;rsquo;s a Portuguese U-21 international and the second is that he&amp;rsquo;s on loan from Porto. Chris Hughton is being linked with a swoop for him and the Portuguese striker said he&amp;rsquo;s be interested in hearing what we have to offer him.</description>

      <description>With Newcastle not playing until Monday, West Brom today had the chance to return to the top of the Coca Cola Championship table and that they did, comprehensively. A four one thrashing at home to Bristol City clearly shortened the odds for West Brom&amp;rsquo;s promotion but we&amp;rsquo;re still only in an early stage of the season, with di Matteo reiterating that. On Monday we&amp;rsquo;ll go to Preston which I believe is live on Sky Sports and hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll be back on top of the table come 10pm.</description>

      <description>Newcastle will visit Preston North End on Monday in a game that could prove very important come the final stages of the Coca Cola Championship season. So far it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty decent from our lads as we are top of the table and are nearly half way through a strenuous season. Sunday will see us visit Preston where we&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to get another three points but I can guarantee you it won&amp;rsquo;t be an easy task.</description>

      <description>To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not in the best of moods today, mainly because France have cheated their way to the World Cup Finals in in South Africa at the expense of my nation, Ireland. Thierry Henry above all people blatantly handled the ball, not once but twice before laying it on William Gallas&amp;rsquo; head to head home an undeserved winner. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound biased but obviously I will as it&amp;rsquo;s my country who have been denied a spot in South Africa.</description>

      <description>It seems we might have found a winger for the rest of the season in Fabrice Pancrate. The Frenchman on trial at Newcastle for the last few days played in the reserves game at home to Hartlepool last night and showed some nice touches, perhaps even worthy of a permanent contract on Tyneside. The game&amp;rsquo;s real hero was Phil Airey, the local lad scoring two goals in a 3-2 victory for Newcastle.</description>

The defender endured a frustrating time at Blackburn and indeed needed a move away from Manchester before the nerves got the better of him. Simpson, who had figured in most of our Championship games so far is on loan but he insists that he&amp;rsquo;s not counting the days until he returns to United, far from it.</description>

This time it isn&amp;rsquo;t Pancake Pancrate, but well known Spanish hitman, Raul Tamudo. The Espanyol striker is as young as could be at 32 and in fairness to the man, has scored a fair few goals.</description>

Most of you saying who I&amp;rsquo;m sure. However, Pancrete has been around for some while now and has played in many of the main European leagues, except for The Premier League. Pancrete is a winger by trade and although I must say I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen him play, his reports are quite good.</description>

Carroll who has been in pretty decent form for his local club Newcastle is supposedly being monitored by Fabio Capello for the England 2010 World Cup squad. These reports might seem just a little dubious and I&amp;rsquo;d be very surprised if the Newcastle born striker was handed a shirt in the same squad as Wayne Rooney, Jermaine Defoe and even the likes of Darren Bent.</description>

      <description>Reports in the Chronicle today claim that Derek Llambias, the second man in charge at Newcastle United, is set to meet with the Supporters Trust, over a possible takeover. It&amp;rsquo;s understood that Llambias offered to meet them within an hour of releasing their statement of intent. However, the NUST have declined the invite and say they&amp;rsquo;re not yet ready to hold talks until their initial campaign has reached top gear. Why Llambias wants to hold talks so quickly, is perhaps because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the Supporters Trust uncovering some facts that won&amp;rsquo;t favour the current Toon hierarchy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you all have players that you&amp;rsquo;d love to see play at Newcastle and now since Mike Ashley is staying and will supposedly &amp;lsquo;back Chris in the market&amp;rsquo; then we might expect some new players to arrive, or certainly hope so. One of the players that Chris has to decide on in the very near future is Marlon Harewood. The bulky striker has been on loan from Villa since September and has failed to produce anything special so far.</description>

      <description>You have to credit them really for pursuing their ambitions in owning their local football club Newcastle United. However, it&amp;rsquo;s still questionable whether NUST or Newcastle United Supporters Trust have what it takes to run a football club which is mainly, money. The &amp;lsquo;Yes We Can&amp;rsquo; campaign has been launched and their members are really serious about taking the club off Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s hands and allowing the fans to have a real say in affairs at Newcastle United.</description>

Today Ed Harrison from NUFCBLOG has announced that he closing the site after 2 years of constant writing. Ed never failed to produce articles on any given day and considering he indeed lives in a different time zone in America, it&amp;rsquo;s a credit to him, what he has achieved. His article archives are full to the brim and he has written in the region of 7,858 articles, a staggering amount for one man.</description>

      <description>With 11 goals to his name for Leeds United already, Jermaine Beckford is taking League 1 by storm so far. As Leeds look set to make it back to the Championship, although in early stages, another team that is expected to pop back up a division is us, Newcastle United. Beckford has been linked to Newcastle now on many occasions and especially in the summer when his agent said he would indeed be interested in moving clubs, and playing on a bigger stage.</description>

      <description>Steven Taylor returned to action yesterday against Peterborough and was reliable throughout the whole of the ninety minutes. Newcastle broke out of the traps very quickly indeed and saw two goals within the first twenty minutes. None less then Jonas Gutierrez scoring his first goal for Newcastle United and local lad Andy Carroll netted his fourth of the season. To be fair to a young Peterborough side, they were too nice to Newcastle and gave them too much respect.</description>

      <description>Chris Hughton has said he&amp;rsquo;s very keen on strengthening his current crop of players will a couple of new arrivals. However, whether these arrivals will be permanent of not, is another matter. Reports are suggesting that although Ashley has agreed to back Chris in the transfer market, no new permanent arrivals could indeed land at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park during the Christmas period. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that numbers are needed for a vigorous upcoming Coca Cola Championship campaign, but we&amp;rsquo;re about a quarter of the way through and doing decently well.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do something different for these exciting weekends of football and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided on a Charity Weekend Bet. This weekend brings a huge amount of games happening in the UK, ranging from Premier League, Championship, League 1, League 2, Scottish Premier Division and FA Cup. Every once in a while, Tyne Time will place £1 on a number of fixtures that should they come through, will pay out handsome dividends.</description>

      <description>### Hughton - Confident that only additions will be made
Chris Hughton has said he&amp;rsquo;s very confident that the squad will not shrink in numbers anymore, after nearly 10 players left in the summer. In return there&amp;rsquo;s been Danny Simpson, Marlon Harewood, and the long-named Zurab. All Premier League players to be fair but neither have showed any of that quality with perhaps Danny Simpson as an exception. However, Hughton believes that there will be no more out goings at the club but instead new faces will more than likely arrive at the forever St.</description>

They insist that the new name is to bolster revenue for the club, and for Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s transfer pot. However, naming it Ashley&amp;rsquo;s own company brings us absolutely no funding and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a mathematician to figure out that it means no cash for Chris in January either. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m wrong and that there will be some cash injected from Sports Direct but in all fairness , there would need to be.</description>

      <description>Ashley - All his eggs in one basket at Newcastle If Newcastle United are not promoted come May, which is a very strong possibility, then Mike Ashley is in serious serious bother. After taking the club off the market for a second time, he now is hoping that we are brought straight back to the Premier League at first attempt, guided by Chris Hughton. To back up his hopes he&amp;rsquo;s promised Chris that&amp;rsquo;ll he&amp;rsquo;ll back him both as manager and in the transfer window.</description>

      <description>He says it&amp;rsquo;s for extra commercial income and that the raised funds from it&amp;rsquo;s sale will go straight to Chris Hughton transfer budget, 100% of it. However, Mike Ashley hasn&amp;rsquo;t a clue of what he&amp;rsquo;s attempting to do. He is meddling with Newcastle United history and inevitably putting yet another foot wrong as his terrible ownership continues.

      <description>### Evans - Will be a big threat tonight
There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that Newcastle United will tonight face a very tough challenge if they are to overcome Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since these two teams last met and it will prove to be an exciting affair. With Sheffield leaking a lot of goals of late and Fabricio Coloccini set to return to an unreliable Newcastle United defence, the score tonight is truly unpredictable.</description>

Just as it seems all is settled on Tyneside regards players, reports have emerged of Jonas Gutierrez possibly moving away from Newcastle in January. The news comes from no-one else but his agent, and how annoying them agents happen to become. As a Newcastle United fan down through the years, agents of players have often proved to be a thorn in our side as they like to force moves and indeed make themselves a little money in the process.</description>

Newcastle will visit Bramall for the first time since 2007 if my memory serves me correctly. On quite a sunny afternoon in Sheffield, Newcastle United beat the hosts 2-1, thanks to goals from Obafemi Martins, and Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s very own Steven Taylor. However, looking back on the team that went out and played that day, very few are still with the club, and it&amp;rsquo;s not that long ago to be fair.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s quite random news and it will be interesting to see whether Chris is interested in signing him.</description>

Mike has promised to invest £20m of his own money by the end of the week, and a lot of that is believed to be going into the transfer pot for Chris, although I find that hard to believe.</description>

The worst insult that a Newcastle United fan could get is not only destroying their beloved club, but trying to destroy their stadium name. Yesterday, on top of the devastating news that Mike Ashley had taken Newcastle United off the market, he also said that they were open to any offers for the naming rights of the stadium. This, is probably the cheekiest, and most arrogant move he has taken to date, and you really have to question yourself if he&amp;rsquo;s that stupid or being an outright (Insert your own word here).</description>

The worst news possible has come today with owner Mike Ashley confirming he has taken the club off the market and has appointed Chris Hughton as permanent manager on an 18-month contract. This isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising news but devastating all the same. To cap it all, Ashley claims to invest £20m immediately and bring the club forward. Not the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve heard this and it&amp;rsquo;s sure to cause uproar amongst the Toon faithful.</description>

      <description>Scouting - And no that guy in the Toon top was never a scout It&amp;rsquo;s quite surprising really to think that Newcastle have a scouting system still in place while the club is trying to change owners. One thing Mike Ashley has done well besides pay huge amounts of money to small jobs, is trying at least to establish a youth policy at Newcastle. Some say it was to save him having to splash out on new signings, but we&amp;rsquo;ll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he has the best intentions in mind.</description>

Marlon Harewood&amp;rsquo;s great start in a Newcastle United shirt by scoring the equaliser against QPR seems like a distant memory now as the physical forward is beginning to irritate the Toon faithful. In the game against Doncaster Marlon didn&amp;rsquo;t play a blinder by any means but labelling him as a &amp;lsquo;donkey&amp;rsquo; is really justified as of yet. Arriving from Aston Villa on loan, the forward was brought here to score goals but it looks as if they&amp;rsquo;ll be few and far between.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s amazing the number of articles I&amp;rsquo;ve written and Mike Ashley has been the subject of, and quite frankly, annoying. The infamous &amp;lsquo;owner&amp;rsquo; has today, if you are to believe the Chronicle, broken off talks with Geoff Sheard&amp;rsquo;s American based investment group. The news comes after Newcastle victory against Doncaster and we can&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a surprise really. Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s patience is meant to have reached it&amp;rsquo;s limit, (the irony) and he&amp;rsquo;s pulled out of negotiations with the much talked about consortium led by the questionable Geoff Sheard.</description>

It comes as no surprise really but I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s people out there who don&amp;rsquo;t like seeing Chris take full control. A huge amount of credit is due to Chris as he&amp;rsquo;s really brought Newcastle to it&amp;rsquo;s feet, on the field anyway and it seems as if he&amp;rsquo;s running a good system throughout the club.</description>

A win is a win, sure enough, but there was nothing spectacular about Newcastle triumphing today, far from it. A 90th minute strike today sealed our first victory in some time and it came none sweeter than a right footed pelter into the bottom corner. The most important thing today is that we did indeed claim all three points, and we need to do the same for the majority of our home games.</description>

One man who has been in determined form of late is Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Danny Guthrie. Danny, who was rumoured to be Keegan&amp;rsquo;s only real signing has showed lots of maturity to adjust to the commotion at Newcastle. It&amp;rsquo;s never easy for any player when you play under three different managers in one season and I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find Guthrie is one of them players who is very keen to see Chris Hughton appointed full-time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;re all well aware that Chris Hughton is very close to becoming Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s new manager within the next few days. Ashley, who looks to have failed with his attempts to sell the club again, is set to appoint Hughton as manager in hope of bringing us back to the Premier League. Two losses in a row, on the road have yet again highlighted our liabilities and none less than a shortage of players.</description>

      <description>NUFC - Second loss in a row in the second tier of English football Yesterday Newcastle slumped to their second successive defeat on the road in the Coca Cola Championship. After going behind from some poor defending, we managed to equalise through Kevin Nolan, and it was a very good goal indeed, Premier League quality to be fair. However, we dropped out of the game again and conceded again with ten minutes remaining.</description>

      <description>Scunthorpe is tonight the venue for Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s latest game on the road following last weeks loss to Nottingham Forest. The latest news to emerge from Newcastle is that Chris Hughton has been offered the full-time job verbally, with negotiations to start after the forthcoming games. Tonight will prove yet another stern test for a dicey Newcastle side of late. With news that Steven Taylor will be out of action for a month, Danny Simpson may well continue his spell at CB or perhaps Tamas Kadar will get a chance, if available for selection.</description>

      <description>### Ashley - About to take NUFC off the market - again
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if this article sounds a bit pessimistic but it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to be on a downer. News has broken today that Chris Hughton will be offered the full-time job and that later this week he&amp;rsquo;ll accept the final terms of what I&amp;rsquo;m sure will be quite a lucrative contract. However, that&amp;rsquo;s not the bad part, actually that probably the best news we could have expected.</description>

      <description>After yesterdays defeat to a rejuvenated Nottingham Forest side, we were shown yet again, that there is a massive need for new arrivals at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. The latest reports are, that Steven Taylor could be out of action for up to 4-6 weeks. As you probably know by now, Shola Ameobi is also injured and won&amp;rsquo;t be returning till early Christmas. With Mike Ashley likely to stay on as owner, you really do wonder if he&amp;rsquo;ll loosen his purse strings and give Chris some cash to spend, because we already know that he&amp;rsquo;s willing to give Hughton the job after today&amp;rsquo;s interview.</description>

      <description>Before I start,I&amp;rsquo;d like to say I don&amp;rsquo;t think Mr.Ashley has a case and today&amp;rsquo;s tattle in the media is being perhaps just a little rich from his side. Speaking today Mike said that&amp;rsquo;s he has lowered the asking price, to an initial fee of £80m and that Barry Moat&amp;rsquo;s persistence in buying the club has been ongoing, for nearly two years. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that Mike himself is frustrated at the stage of the sale and that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been completed yet but he just doesn&amp;rsquo;t realise how we feel as our beloved club is being dangled over a burning pit.</description>

      <description>Ashley - Lowers asking price to £80m There is some quite astonishing news today that Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has first of all, spoken to the media for the first time in months and indeed that he has lowered his asking price of the club to £80m. Speaking today to the Sunday Times he claims that he&amp;rsquo;s done his very best to sell the club and that Barry Moat has been on his case for the last two years.</description>

      <description>Well I think the first thing you have to say is Welcome to the Coca Cola Championship, Newcastle United. Today, a single albeit dubious goal from Dexter Blackstock saw off a Toon effort that just wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough on the day. My headline might suggest some haste in losing the game but in all fairness you have to give credit to Nottingham Forest for not laying back, and indeed giving it their all against &amp;lsquo;the biggest club in the league&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that just after relegation, we wanted anybody but Chris Hughton as manager of Newcastle United. However, Shearer didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive, Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s comeback rumours were slashed at the but by NUFC themselves and David O&amp;rsquo;Leary&amp;rsquo;s move broke down. However now, Hughton has done a very good job and the majority of the players now want Chris as permanent manager. Lying top of the Coca Cola Chamoionship table and the players actually are playing for the shirt they wear, even the banana strip.</description>

Jonas Gutierrez in midweek secured his longest dream, of bringing Argentina to South Africa and indeed he himself, played a major hand in the deciding goal against Uruguay. Although he only won the free-kick which led to the goal, he looked quite sharp at times and the oppositions full-back found it quite difficult to keep taps on the &amp;lsquo;greyhound&amp;rsquo;. Tomorrow, Jonas is expected to line out in Nottingham where hopefully he&amp;rsquo;ll play his part in a win for Newcastle United.</description>

Newcastle will tomorrow attempt to keep their lead in the Coca Cola Championship as we face a trip to Nottingham Forest. Forest themselves who have had a touch a go start to the season aren&amp;rsquo;t doing too badly, lying in about mid-table. For us, we can stay aloft the league and also, hopefully stretch our lead should West Brom, Middlesbrough or Sheffield face a blip in these weekend games.</description>

      <description>NUFC - Spirit of Newcastle too much for Ashley Throughout Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s rather unfortunate tenure at Newcastle to put it mildly, the mighty NUFC have suffered the worst a top flight team can, relegation. If you told a Newcastle fan three years ago, that his/her beloved club would be in the Coca Cola Championship, they&amp;rsquo;d laugh their head off and tell you to stay away from the Newcastle Brown Ale.</description>

      <description>Hughton - Rumoured to have nothing to spend in January Lee Ryder has today posted an article claiming that Chris Hughton will have no transfer funds to spend this January. Hughton, who has led Newcastle to the top of the Coca Cola Championship table and virtually sorted NUFC out on the pitch, was hoping to strengthen in the coming transfer window. However, news is emerging that Ashley, who saved a handsome penny in the Keegan scenario, is unwilling to hand over a few million to the every loyal Chris Hughton.</description>

Star Foundation from the USA are said to be backing a new approach led with Geoff Sheard spearheading it, even though Sheard himself, failed with the buyout of Sheffield Wednesday and indeed failed to back up his initial statements last month claiming he was all set to buy Newcastle with different American backing.</description>

When clubs like Newcastle United go down, they go down with a bang. Indeed we did but we got back on our feet and are continuing to grow. For any other club relegation is awful, for us, it&amp;rsquo;s more than a nightmare. However, that nightmare came true on the 24th of May 2009 when Damien Duff&amp;rsquo;s deflected goal sent us down. Fortunately that&amp;rsquo;s behind us.</description>

      <description>As my headline suggests Sunderland have been linked with a move for Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Jose Enrique today but there&amp;rsquo;s no need to get worried, it&amp;rsquo;s only coming from the News Of The World who on Sundays, usually dedicate at least 2 articles to us. The reports claim that Bruce will make his move in January for the Spaniard and will hope to seal a deal very quickly. However, I doubt very much as if Enrique will want to leave and honestly, he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed after he was on the relegated side earlier this year, that still owe us a huge amount.</description>

Newcastle United winger Jonas Gutierrez will tonight line out in what is a must win game for Argentina. If the Argies, led by former World Cup legend and the founder of the hand of god, Maradona, lose tonight, then their chances of making usually a familiar trip to the World Cup Finals, will be over. Maradona who claimed staggeringly, that his first three names on the Argentina team sheet were Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s very own Jonas Gutierréz will as you&amp;rsquo;d expect start Jonas tonight and we certainly hope he comes back injury free.</description>

      <description>Towering Malmo centre forward Edward Ofere is reportedly ticking the interest of current Newcastle United manager, Chris Hughton. The 6&amp;rsquo;3 Nigerian who has played more than a couple of times for his international side was scouted by Toon staff and their reports back to Chris were positive. Whether we need another tall and rumbustious striker is debatable with Ameobi, Carroll, Nile Ranger all on the books already but the reports on this lad are very interesting indeed.</description>

Well he;s injured again and taking time out he spoke to Sky Sports at length, confessing to bust-up&amp;rsquo;s with Chris Hughton and Alan Shearer, Kinnear the only one he didn&amp;rsquo;t have a tattle with it seems.</description>

      <description>As the great Ed Harrison reported on nufcblog.com, the settlement of the Keegan case would leave to some more takeover stories and indeed ones that are far from relevant. Just as Barry Moat was set to seal a deal and we think he is still in the driving seat, new consortia come along, on top of the other two already witting against the local Tyneside businessman. Today brings the news that South Africans have entered the race too, just like last year, expect they had no money to back their interest, story of NUFC all summer.</description>

      <description>As it finally seems Mike Ashley will pack his bags and leave Newcastle United, a little premature excitement is creeping in. Not just the fact he&amp;rsquo;s leaving (or so we are led to believe) but also the reality that we are set to get a local owner, and not many clubs can say that. Today reports say that Mr.Barry Moat has written a letter to Mike with a formal offer, expected to be in the region of £90-95m and we expect our current owner to accept it or God knows what will happen.</description>

      <description>Being a fan through both the good and the bad times (and there&amp;rsquo;s been plenty of both) I have started to see hope come about in abundance because we&amp;rsquo;re lying aloft the Coca Cola Championship. This is exciting to say the least but some people are already getting prepared for a Premier League season next year. Whoever is thinking this way needs a serious head check (no offence). The days are gone when we used to contest the Premier League, FA Cup&amp;rsquo;s and even reach the knock-out stages in the Champions League.</description>

Finally the day has come when I can say that Mike Ashley will not be Newcastle United owner for another few months. The Keegan scenario has been dealt with and £2m is a shock relief for Mike Ashley and his compatriots. This is good news, as it means that the wreckage has been cleared from the track to complete the sale of Newcastle United, and the long awaited one at that.</description>

      <description>Our problem this year in the league so far, bar the game at Portman Road, is leaving it too late to kill off games. We saw it at Leicester, Plymouth and indeed in our last game against Queens Park Rangers where new boy Marlon Harewood was on hand to tap home, with twenty minutes remaining. The thing is, we should have games done and dusted before 60&amp;rsquo; and against QPR if we were to have taken our chances then it would have been more than a comfortable victory for Newcastle.</description>

      <description>### Kevin - Insistent on suing Mike Ashley
It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day to see a former Newcastle footballer and manager, win a court case against his &amp;lsquo;beloved&amp;rsquo; club. However, you have to look at Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s side of the story. Perhaps he deserved it, maybe there&amp;rsquo;s no question about it, but surely you think that Keegan wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to such lengths just to be able to say he was right. Today Mike Ashley was ordered to pay £2m in compensation to Kevin and perhaps even more, dependent on future developments.</description>

      <description>If it&amp;rsquo;s not very common at Newcastle, that players score on their home debut but Marlon Harewood did just that against Queens Park Rangers last night. Although we rued the chance to go five points clear at the top, the main thing is, the lads got something out of the game. It was a game that you just thought it was going to one of those nights. However, to say we were lucky isn&amp;rsquo;t even a joke.</description>

      <description>Jonas Gutierrez is back for tonight&amp;rsquo;s encounter with QPR at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park following his absence due to injury. The Argentine, who has pledged his allegiance to Newcastle and to his country to bring both of them to where they belong, Argentina to the World Cup and the more important one, Newcastle United back to the Premier League. It will good to welcome back Jonas who will be more than an asset in the Coca Cola Championship, and just as he was getting into his stride, injury struck vs Huddersfield, in the same game as Shola Ameobi limped off.</description>

      <description>### Ryan - Has settled well on Tyneside
You could nearly say that he&amp;rsquo;s been one our players of the season so far. Chipping in with a couple of goals too, and no ordinary goals mind you. Ryan Taylor&amp;rsquo;s latest was against Ipswich when he caught the keeper in an awkward position and caressed it into the top corner, and not a fluke as some may have suggested. He also hit the target with a stunning strike, with his left this time, into the other top corner, in a two nil win against Crystal Palace earlier this year.</description>

      <description>The news hasn&amp;rsquo;t bee based on the takeover news this Sunday or indeed the last week, which is quite surprising. Barry Moat is still on course to complete the takeover of our beloved club but he;s waiting on the Kevin Keegan court case to be settled before he&amp;rsquo;s handed the keys of St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. You can imagine the scenes around Newcastle when Mike Ashley finally leaves the club, and a local owner with every ambition to appoint Alan Shearer as manager, control the club properly, or so we hope.</description>

      <description>Not long ago we had Michael Owen, one of the worlds most famous footballer, lining out in the Black and White of Newcastle United but after a rather dismal turn in events (relegation) Owen left, for the better we think. Yesterday the vacant #10 jersey was sported by Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s new signing, Marlon Harewood, on loan from Aston Villa. It quite an interesting turn around at Newcastle, as it seems Chris has filled the vacant positions, left behind by high paid &amp;lsquo;stars&amp;rsquo;, with determined players who want the very best for Newcastle United and their mighty fans.</description>

      <description>Indeed it&amp;rsquo;s very true that the first 90 minutes of any football game are the most important, and that will be the case at Portman Road come half five too. This will be the first time in some time that we&amp;rsquo;ve visited Ipswich Town, one of Bobby Robson&amp;rsquo;s many homes. Hopefully we can do Sir Bobby proud and grab all three points but Roy Keane&amp;rsquo;s team will also be hoping to clinch a long awaited win for the Tractor Boys.</description>

      <description>### Harewood - Enjoying his first training session
It could only happen at Newcastle, where their local cult hero, leaves the club, not for the first time, and then, turn around and tries to sue the clubs owner. As yo probably guessed it&amp;rsquo;s Kevin Keegan I&amp;rsquo;m talking about and his little affair with Mike Ashley. Today, the case closed are the tribunal resigned in order to make their decision. Whether Keegan will win his case is still unknown but he must be pretty confident when he&amp;rsquo;s brought the millionaire to the courts over &amp;lsquo;an unfair dismissal&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>### Zurab - Only player not linked
In a special edition of Tyne Time we today look at the sheer amount of players that have been linked with Newcastle United since relegation and the ones that actually arrived. As you probably can figure, there&amp;rsquo;s been truly rubbish transfer rumours put in our street and we&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with them. My headline is probably inappropriate and is far less than the actual figure but I&amp;rsquo;ve picked out 43 main players that has been linked to the sacred Black and White jersey and some of them, will just make you laugh.</description>

      <description>Marlon Harewood today completed his long awaited loan-move to Newcastle after weeks of speculation. Martin O&amp;rsquo;Neill is keen for the striker to get some playing time, and Newcastle were more than happy to take him. This time last year, we would&amp;rsquo;ve wanted someone like Gabriel Agbonlahor but being in the Championship, those targets are no longer realistic. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong though, I&amp;rsquo;m sure Marlon will be a very good signing and if he scores goals and we manage promotion ( :O ) then there&amp;rsquo;s every chance that we&amp;rsquo;d want him permanently, although his loan ends in January.</description>

      <description>It seems the Iranian businessman who was hell bent on buying Newcastle United, and bringing Kevin Keegan back as manager is gone with the wind. Although we doubted him from the very first second we heard of it, it&amp;rsquo;s still quite odd that there&amp;rsquo;s been nothing about him, in any of the tabloids or elsewhere, about his stance on the sale. First of all, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find out whether he was a real person or not but</description>

      <description>### Enrique - Being realistic about cup chances
Jose Enrique, speaking today has rubbished Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning the Carling Cup this year, saying we simply &amp;lsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t have the legs for it&amp;rsquo;. He may well be right too you know, and is being realistic. Not many Toon fans are ever too confident when it comes to cups with Newcastle and the likelihood is, we&amp;rsquo;ll be nowhere near the major stages of this competition when it comes into it&amp;rsquo;s prime.</description>

In a gathering, in the fine Durham cathedral saw the Newcastle first team, alongside Chris Hughon, Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne, Peter Beardsley, Gary Lineker, and Fabio Capello all attend. It was an emotional event for Gazza who was reduced to tears but most people within the sacred grounds couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel they had a lost a great great man.</description>

      <description>Marlon Harewood&amp;rsquo;s agent today confirmed that the Villa striker was very close to a loan move to Newcastle. The Villa forward, who has been out of action for a considerable amount of time now was being tracked by Chris Hughton since August and after Harewood overcame his injury, Hughton was once again in for his services. As you all know, Harewood is quite a beast or physical player on the ball, he also has the ability to score quite a few goals and we&amp;rsquo;d expect a fair share of them, in his stunt on Tyneside.</description>

James Vaughan, Everton&amp;rsquo;s striker join Derby County on loan whilst Irishman and Hull hitman, Caleb Folan completed his much awaited move to Middlesbrough. Both were targets of Newcastle, as confirmed by Chris himself and it&amp;rsquo;s quite disappointing to lose out, especially on James Vaughan who could&amp;rsquo;ve been excellent for us this season as we hope for a immediate return to the Premier League.</description>

      <description>A win&amp;rsquo;s a win and we&amp;rsquo;re just happy to get all three points today. Far from a polished performance from a Newcastle United team saw us overcome a pretty lame Plymouth effort, to say the least. We started the game well with Steven Taylor heading home, but only from absolutely dire defending from Paul Sturrock&amp;rsquo;s side. However, we should&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped the game up by the first half with all the chances we had.</description>

We haven&amp;rsquo;t heard much on the Newcastle United sale lately but today brings news that a fee has been agreed with a buyer. The club issued an official statement to the &amp;lsquo;Journal&amp;rsquo; saying that the £100m had been met but the overdraft was still a stumbling block as well as the Kevin Keegan scenario. Although Barry Moat is being strongly linked with the role, and it&amp;rsquo;s more than likely he is the man involved, there are reported to be two other bidders interested in the club, but yet to make an official bid.</description>

      <description>Diomansy Kamara is now unlikely to arrive to Newcastle on loan after Roy Hodgson dismissed reports and then started the striker in the Europa League affair yesterday. It so happened that he also scored in yesterdays affair and the odds of him joining Chris Hughton is very unlikely. We were hopeful that a deal could be sorted and indeed Chris confirmed his interest but it seems we&amp;rsquo;ll have to look to Marlon Harewood, Daniel Cousin or Caleb Folan to boost our front men.</description>

      <description>Players - Showing no signs of instability and uncertainty The following days after Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s relegation from the Premier League, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much news. The media, were giving us a little time to remorse amongst ourselves until they got their chance to take constant digs at NUFC throughout the summer. We were used to new headlines in the papers each day of &amp;lsquo;Toon walkout&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Toon exodus&amp;rsquo; but look at us now, we&amp;rsquo;ve barely missed any of our players that have left.</description>

      <description>As surprising as it may sound, Chris Hughton has money to spend on new players at Newcastle. Even though we&amp;rsquo;re stuck amidst a takeover and whatnot, Hughton has a little cash to spend on new faces, and we suspect that it&amp;rsquo;s just a tiny fraction of what NUFC received in transfer fees this season. Reports were that on the last day of the transfer window, we had a bid of £1.</description>

      <description>Well I suppose all of us wanted him to balloon it that day, or fall into a hole in the ground but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Diomansy Kamara tucked it away, past the despairing Steve Harper and beyond the Sebastien Bassong. We were in huge trouble and it meant that the Premier League relegation candidates would be decided on the last day of the EPL. We&amp;rsquo;d all like to forget that, and look at our current position.</description>

Colo, who got his head to a looping Ryan Taylor cross celebrated the goal like a real goalscorer too and enjoyed every moment of it. It is Fabricio&amp;rsquo;s first goal for the club but hopefully not his last as he showed to day that as well as heading, he&amp;rsquo;s not that bad at defending either, keeping Michael Chopra and Jay Boothroyd at bay for 90 minutes.</description>

      <description>### Cousin - Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a bad acquisition
After the news of Caleb Folan&amp;rsquo;s reported loan move to Newcastle United, there is more news today, that Newcastle are looking for Daniel Cousin as well. The forward who is very similar to Caleb Folan hasn&amp;rsquo;t been in and out of the Hull City side and it seems his relationship with manager Phil Brown isn&amp;rsquo;t a love affair by any means. Most of you will remember cousin scoring against us in the cup, which put us out last year but that was then and half the team that played that night no longer wear the Black and White of Newcastle United.</description>

If Newcastle manage to beat Cardiff today, then they&amp;rsquo;ll return to the summit of the Coca Cola Championship and Hughton&amp;rsquo;s fine managerial experience will continue. I think most Toon fans have taken Chris for granted but there is now, the serious possibility that Mike Ashley will appoint Hughton manager on a full-time basis, should he fail to sell the club.</description>

The Irishman who was initially hired as an assistant for Kevin Keegan, in in his second term as temporary manager and he&amp;rsquo;s loving every minute of it, to say the least. And why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he? Top of the table, playing good football and attracting on average, 40,000 Geordies to St.</description>

      <description>Sensational Cardiff City manager, OK, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit over generous with him, but it&amp;rsquo;s Friday! Anyway, Dave Jones, the Cardiff City manager was speaking today about their chances against Newcastle United. Cardiff who are doing very well themselves and Toon old boy Michael Chopra banging in the goals, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have wished for a better start. Neither could we though, grabbing 13 from a possible 15 and the draw happening on the first day against promotion favourites, West Brom.</description>

      <description>### Cort - Good enough for Newcastle? Stokes&amp;rsquo; Leon Cort is being linked with a move to Newcastle tonight after the CB has fallen short of the first team at the Britannia. Bobby Robson engineered a move for Carl Cort, the infamous striker that cost Newcastle United £7m and failed to produce but we think things might be different with Leon. Of course he&amp;rsquo;d arrive on loan for a month and we&amp;rsquo;d take things from there but I suppose any back up or indeed players are only a plus at Newcastle.</description>

      <description>### Vokes - Bound for Tyneside?
Sam Vokes, a prominent Sam Allardyce target during his short spell is being linked with a move to Newcastle United once again. The Welshman who was heavily linked with us last year could well be on his way to Tyneside after his boss, Mick McCarthy said he&amp;rsquo;s more than willing to let the striker leave on loan. Wolves recruited talented Irish forward Kevin Doyle in the summer and Vokes can&amp;rsquo;t manage to push the other Irish striker Andy Keogh out of the team either.</description>

      <description>Sturrock - Not our transfer target, but his manager Reported Newcastle United target Marcel Seip, from Plymouth Argyle, has been placed on the transfer window after a bust up with manager Paul Sturrock. It was reported that Newcastle were close to signing this player last weekend but Hughton dismissed these rumours. However, just like rumours are, they don&amp;rsquo;t go away too easily (especially at Newcastle) and news is rife that we&amp;rsquo;re about to complete a loan move for him within the next couple of days.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s good to see Newcastle United top of the table as we enter a new month but it&amp;rsquo;s also very sad to still see Mike Ashley in control of the club and making no progress or any good decisions at all. Chris Hughton who was recruited as an assistant to Kevin Keegan (remember him?) is now first team manager, for now at least. However, 15 weeks since Newcastle were put on the market for a second time in two years, we are still ownerless and looking for new owners.</description>

      <description>Guthrie - Wants to continue his good form Some say Danny Guthrie was Kevin Keegan&amp;rsquo;s only signing whilst in charge of Newcastle United. However, it was a very good signing indeed. Guthrie who left Liverpool because of Steven Gerrards&amp;rsquo; brilliance, he himself is starting to show similar characteristics of the Liverpool captain. Although not a regular, when we were in the Premier League, Guthrie played well any time he came no or started.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as that, and although we have made pretty much a perfect start to our Championship campaign, our next two games will really test our resolve.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times before, and it&amp;rsquo;s been emphasised quite a lot elsewhere is the youth setup Newcastle United have at the minute and indeed the fruit we are bearing from it. It&amp;rsquo;s without a doubt the best thing Mike Ashley implemented on Tyneside during his torrid tenure but I&amp;rsquo;m speaking as if he&amp;rsquo;s gone, unfortunately he&amp;rsquo;s not, just yet. A man who is attracting a lot of interest at just 17 is Haris Vu?</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re led to believe that Tuesday is the day of reckoning for Barry Moat and Newcastle United. Indeed it would bring Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;deadlines&amp;rsquo; well into double figures without any end result in either of them. We&amp;rsquo;re sick of the constant rumours of who is taking us over and who isn&amp;rsquo;t, we just want new owners, and now, it seems that Barry Moat is well and truly the last contender for the club after the supposed American group failed to produce proof of funds, sound familiar?</description>

      <description>Who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought or indeed would&amp;rsquo;ve said, a year ago, that Shola Ameobi would be a huge loss to Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s strike force? Ameobi, who is Nigerian by birth is starting to show, this season at least, some of the quality the famous Nigerian strikers had. Bagging a hattrick against Reading, scoring the winner v Sheffield Wednesday and adding to his tally in the Carling Cup vs Huddersfield, Shola has established himself as a real threat to Championship defences this season.</description>

Speaking today to local papers today, Chris Hughton, who is doing a really good job with the lads this season, revealed who he tried for during the transfer window period. Although the window has slammed shut, and slammed firmly shut for Chelsea, Championship squads can continue to loan and sign free agents. We&amp;rsquo;re currently top of the table, the last we said that was on the first day of the season with Sam Allardyce in charge, after a 3-1 victory at Bolton.</description>

      <description>The Toon hopeful are still holding onto a glimmer of hope that we may well sign more than Peter Lovenkrands. Championship clubs still have the option to bring players in outside the transfer window. Craig Cathcart, Marlon Harewood, Darron Gibson and Franco di Santo have all be mentioned. Stay tuned to Sky Sports to get the latest developments on the scenario .

On a deadline day which hasn&amp;rsquo;t produced anything special besides a lot of rumours, Newcastle United have completed the signing(re) of Peter Lovenkrands. The Dane who departed from Newcastle are receiving a letter from the hierarchy saying his services were no longer needed, has signed for Chris Hughton and it&amp;rsquo;s a very good signing for our threadbare Championship squad indeed.

While I&amp;rsquo;ve been away it seems there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk and not much action per usual, but the good news that greeted me today, was reports that the firesale had ended at Newcastle United, and that&amp;rsquo;s very good news, to say the least.</description>

      <description>Chris Hughton has given us the clearest indication yet that more players will leave at Newcastle and as well as that, new faces are set to arrive. As the transfer window closes very very soon, Hughton is braced for new arrivals and as reported last night Gareth Bale is rumoured to be extremely close to sealing a move. However, the only problem is, his wage demands. At Spurs, Bale is meant to be earning 45k a week and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, that&amp;rsquo;s far too much for a lad his age.</description>

      <description>Well in what was quiet an exciting game to say the least, Newcastle United managed to overcome Huddersfield Town. Goals from Shola Ameobi, Danny Guthrie, Geremi (I know 😮 ) and Kevin Nolan sealed a great comeback for the hard-working lads. Indeed that&amp;rsquo;s what they did, they worked. Although we had to introduce our first teamers, it was quiet a good performance all round by the little Newcastle squad. The much talked about, Nile Ranger played the game and did quiet well in what seemed to be a 4-5-1 formation from stand in boss, Chris Hughton.</description>

      <description>Bale - Would be a good addition It appears, well according to the BBC, that Gareth Bale is very close to joining Newcastle United on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The news breaks after Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s emphatic win against Huddersfield Town, well maybe not emphatic, but it was a memorable sight. When is the last time we&amp;rsquo;ve came from 1-3 down and still win?
Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s sure to be more details following this outburst of news, but it would be rather warming to get Bale in, as I personally, rate him very highly, even though he hasn&amp;rsquo;t overly impressed at Tottenham.</description>

      <description>Danny Simpson&amp;rsquo;s arrival from Manchester United a while back has been Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s only &amp;lsquo;signing&amp;rsquo; of the summer, so far. Mind you, it&amp;rsquo;s only a loan deal and lasts to January, which is pretty poor if you ask me. I can&amp;rsquo;t see why Newcastle don&amp;rsquo;t look to loan Macheda, or Fabio or indeed his brother Rafael.
There are plenty of players, as I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times before, that would join Newcastle in a flash, now more than ever, after our good start to the Coca Cola Championship campaign.</description>

The latest gust of news/rumours/(made up nonsense), is that Newcastle United have a new bidder.

      <description>Remember him? Peter Lovenkrands? Well, he used to play for us last season if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know and since then he has been relieved of his contract at Newcastle United, looking to ply his trade elsewhere. I think most people will remember him, he fought for the magpies in every game, and scored three goals in his stint here as well. Signed by Joe Kinnear on a free from Schalke, Lovenkrands most memorable Newcastle moment would have been scoring the third goal against Middlesbrough which indeed proved to be Newcastle]s&amp;rsquo;s last top flight goal that season.</description>

      <description>Ashley - Still in control Mike Ashley is still in control of Newcastle United, 13 weeks after we suffered the dreaded drop to the Coca Cola Championship. The news today, is that the deadline has been extended for Barry Moat to complete the takeover of the club but that news, carries both good and bad consequences. First of all it means we probably will not sign anyone this transfer window at all but the upside is, that Mike Ashley is very much willing to sell to Barry Moat and is trying his utmost to hand over the club to the local businessman.</description>

      <description>Quite literally my headline suggests what I&amp;rsquo;m touching on, the absurd news of Derek Llambias running across the pitch in Selhurst park, totally naked. To think Newcastle couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any more, media attention but no , we&amp;rsquo;re brought to new depths. The best part is, we won two nil, and kept our third clean sheet, meaning we go top, even with our neighbours Middlesbrough. Things have gone really well for us so far, and all we need is the sale of the club to boost the morale even higher, however, with that behaviour from our hierarchy, I think (unfortunately), they may be tempted to keep the club, and take NUFC off the market.</description>

      <description>There were reports earlier from who else but the questionable tabloids , that a deadline of 5pm had been set today, for the sale of Newcastle United to be completed. However Sky Sports and their infamous David Craig has been on within the last few minutes to confirm that no deadline has been set and wait, they have no intention in selling Steven Taylor. A mixture of good and bad news but we never really expected the news from the tabloids to be very credible.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sad when it has come to this, a Newcastle United player, brought through the ranks, and having becoming a Newcastle United first team member, looking for the exit door at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. Sky Sports News (who else?) are reporting that the local lad, could be set for a move to David Moyes&amp;rsquo;s Everton side who are fighting a losing battle with their own English centre back, Joleon Lescott. If this news is true, which we hope it&amp;rsquo;s not, then it&amp;rsquo;ll really put gas to the fire and the frustration will be taken out on Mike Ashley more than ever before.</description>

      <description>We can&amp;rsquo;t fault the lads performances over the season so far, two wins and a draw, that draw being a dreaded away trip to the Hawthorns for any other Championship side. However Newcastle United are not any Championship side, only at Newcastle could we attract nearly 44,000 to a home game, mind you, it only being the third game of the season and the traveling Geordies weren&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. Another Ameobi goal and another three points, leaving Newcastle 3rd in the Coca Cola Championship league standings.</description>

      <description>There has been a new spanner thrown into the works at Newcastle United now as yesterday, Sky Sports were told that Graham Roberts, a former footballer was heading a bid from a consortium called &amp;lsquo;Fans 410&amp;rsquo;, to buy Newcastle United. This news comes just as Barry Moat was close to sealing the club but now the former defender said that he has friends who want to own a football club and that the Magpies are the perfect opportunity.</description>

      <description>The future of Newcastle United lies with a bank called Barclays, the sponsors of the Premier League. Today (Wednesday), Barry Moat was expected to hear back on whether he&amp;rsquo;s request was successful. If he is not which there is a good chance in happening, then Newcastle will remain in the hands of Mike Ashley until January at the very least, however, we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that Moat does indeed get his loan from Barry Moat.</description>

      <description>Peter Lovenkrands may well come back to Newcastle United on a permanent basis it has been revealed. The Dane who signed for Newcastle on a free following his departure from Schalke saw Joe Kinnear snap him up on a contract until the end of the season however with the constant uncertainty and no manager, Lovekrands was released on a free after he received a letter from Newcastle saying that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t needed any more.</description>

      <description>Derek Llambias today confirmed to Sky Sports News that Barry Moat has indeed begun talks with the clubs hierarchy over the sale of the beleaguered club. Moat was present at our 3-0 win over Reading in which was one of the finest games the lads have played in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park in a long time. At the final whistle, Moat was seen shaking hands with Mike Ashley, perhaps just a business style fashion but it could be interpreted as agreeing on the sale of the club in principle.</description>

      <description>Fabricio Coloccini is being touted for a return to Spain after a number of clubs have show interest in the Argentinian centre back. Arriving from Deportivo for a staggering £10.3m, Colo never settled and his game under Kevin Keegan (yes, Kevin Keegan) against Manchester United was arguably his best one. We saw glimpses of the old Coloccini against reading on Saturday but it all has to do with confidence. If we get an offer of half the mount we paid to Fabricio I think that it may well be accepted.</description>

      <description>### Ameobi - Sublime three goals today
In a game which saw potential Newcastle United owner Barry Moat sit inbetween the current hierarchy at Newcastle of Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias, Newcastle produced a performance to remember and one needed to boost all sides morale. Newcastle started the game brightly creating chances and were comfortably controlling the game. Jonas was presented with a great opportunity after a Kevin Nolan through ball but the Argentine per usual, stumbled and didn&amp;rsquo;t show an end product.</description>

I suppose you could say things go from bad to worse for Newcastle, first sources close to the club indicating that they are ready to take Newcastle United from the market and now, one of our half decent players ready to move down London way to opt for Fulham. You can&amp;rsquo;t blame Damien for wanting to leave and especially to a prospering side such as Fulham.</description>

      <description>As I said in my previous article, the loan signing of Danny Simpson could have well indicated that Mike Ashley is staying as owner and breaking news from Sky Sports and their North Eastern reporter, David Craig indicate Ashley will take the club off the market in about a week if no one comes forward to offer an acceptable amount. What ever happened to Barry Moat and his deposit today or about them being in talks with more consortia that just Moat?</description>

      <description>When you see loan signings coming to Newcastle you might, first of all, surprised that we have even attempted to sign a player or secondly there has been some development in the sale of the club. However, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get too excited as I think it could mean something far worse, Ashley staying on at Newcastle and regaining control of our club for another season. Sky Sports have just announced that David O&amp;rsquo;Leary is out of the running (Good) and that the post is still under consideration.</description>

A little breaking news for all you readers, it&amp;rsquo;s reported that Damien Duff, Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s prolific left winger or right winger, is wanted by an &amp;lsquo;unnamed&amp;rsquo; club. Sky Sports are reporting now that Damien Duff, who scored Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s first Coca Cola Championship goal that a £4m is on the table. We don&amp;rsquo;t really know who the bid could be from but Blackburn springs to mind.</description>

      <description>Although we&amp;rsquo;re stuck in probably the position a football club could be in with no manager, no owner and no new signings it&amp;rsquo;s more than surprising to hear that Newcastle United scouts were present at the Scotland and Norway game last night. A game in which Norway won comfortably, all eyes were on Erik Huseklepp, the Norwegian who has attracted a lot of interest from other clubs, including our own very Newcastle United it seems.</description>

      <description>### Moat - Stubborn as Ashley
OK, you might be saying to yourself, Ashley is far from a businessman and has no brain at all. Each day it keeps tilting towards that instinct but considering he was a billionaire, he must have done some things right. He&amp;rsquo;s the owner of most Sports Direct retail stores, and even though their sales went sky high this year, their operating profit has decreased steadily from the last year.</description>

      <description>Moat - Needs to deposit funds by Friday It seems that the decision is with Barry Moat whether to buy the club at this stage. It&amp;rsquo;s understood that Mike Ashley is willing to accept the offer from Moat but he wants a deposit by Friday in an unspecified bank account. If Moat can do this then he will complete the takeover and we will be finally be Ashley free. Whether Moat can agree to this is another thing, Ashley will then take Newcastle United off the market and appoint either David O&amp;rsquo;Leary or Joe Kinnear to the managerial role.</description>

Some may be delighted to see the guy go, he&amp;rsquo;s been labelled everything from a headless chicken to an astounding dribbler but either way he wants out of Newcastle, and sooner the better. I suppose I can&amp;rsquo;t blame Gutierrez too much for leaving and I believe that he&amp;rsquo;ll be a very good player in the years to come. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget that performance in Old Trafford when he caused real havoc for United, indeed most Toon fans will never forget that, managing a point but not only that, Fabricio Coloccini having a great game too.</description>

Mike Ashley, the torrid owner of Newcastle United, has one last chance to get out of the club before it&amp;rsquo;s too late, yet again. It&amp;rsquo;s being reported today that Ashley is flying back from Hawaii , cutting short an undeserved holiday to return and discuss Barry Moat&amp;rsquo;s bid. It&amp;rsquo;s believed Moat has bid around £70m and Ashley isn&amp;rsquo;t too keen on accepting it, only thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s the only bidder let on the table with the Profitable Group having pulled out a while back.</description>

A pretty good performance all round had Newcastle fans cheering throughout the 90 minutes at the Hawthorns today. In a game which is the start of a relentless Championship campaign, Newcastle United showed , in patches that they could well come to terms with the Championship, sooner rather than later. Holding a minutes applause for the late, Great Sir Bobby Robson, teams got under way and Newcastle to say the least, were looking the most dangerous.</description>

Passing away at 76, the whole world mourned his death. As George Caulkin rightly said, it brought the North East of England together. Seeing Newcastle United jerseys everywhere with a few patches of red and white, signaling the Sunderland respect it showed, as much as there was rivalry between the two sides, there is a very thin line between it.</description>

      <description>After a long time of asking and constant speculation, last seasons best player is extremely close to signing for Harry Redknapp&amp;rsquo;s Spurs side. Following Darren Bent&amp;rsquo;s departure to Sunderland for £10m it&amp;rsquo;s believed that Redknapp will be using that money on Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s prized asset, Sebastien Bassong. Bassong who signed for a mere £500,000k has proved himself in English football in his first season, shining out in a lacklustre Newcastle United side.</description>

      <description>Moat - Has reportedly bid £100m The latest news coming for St.James&amp;rsquo; Park is that a local business tycoon has bid £100m for Newcastle United. This news comes as yesterdays article from The Times and The Chronicle claimed that local business tycoon was ready to invest into the club. Moat is a luxury box-office holder at Newcastle and has been for some time now. The payment from which he renewed his season ticket, the money was used in the youth setup and invested in that area.</description>

      <description>### Kinnear - Clearly hasn&amp;rsquo;t taken the news well
Phew! That was a close one. Most fans were about to cry when they heard Joe Kinnear could be returning as Newcastle United manager but David Craig and his &amp;lsquo;sources&amp;rsquo; at Newcastle have confirmed that Kinnear will not be returning as manager. However it&amp;rsquo;s understood that Mike Ashley as Derek Llambias visited Joe Kinnear checking up on his, asking whether he was ready to return to football.</description>

      <description>Kinnear - Claims he&amp;rsquo;s been offered job at Newcastle Just when we thought we&amp;rsquo;d hear no more from him, Joe Kinnear has come out and claimed he has been offered his managerial spot back at Newcastle United. BBC News broke this story and since it&amp;rsquo;s been on Sky Sports News with David Craig up North-east has claimed that Joe Kinnear will not be returning as manager. This news comes as Keith Harris says the club should be sold by the end of August and we&amp;rsquo;ve no manager, and players leaving around us.</description>

      <description>Brown - Looking to actually sign a player Breaking news yet again, and it&amp;rsquo;s not takeover talk, it&amp;rsquo;s about a man called Phil Brown and a team by the name of Hull City. Sky Sports News are reporting that both Habib Beye and Sebastien Bassong could be gone from Newcastle by the end of this week as Hull City have improved an offer for Beye, and Sebastien Bassong is pleading for an exit from St.</description>

      <description>As the rumours get the hopes up on Tyneside we are let down again , this time the Chronicle are claiming that the club will more than likely be under the control of Mike Ashley. We&amp;rsquo;ve had Malaysians, Singaporeans , Americans, Irish, Chinese, Dubai, Iranians, Nigerians, Englishmen and Sunderland fans hoaxes throughout our takeover journey. We hoped that after relegation things would&amp;rsquo;ve picked up and maybe with Shearer appointed as manager and new owners we could just make the play-offs but now, there&amp;rsquo;s not much chance of this happening.</description>

      <description>Third - Very nice jersey for a third choice shirt Amidst all the speculation and all the desperation, Newcastle always surprise us. Before yesterdays game against Dundee it was announced the lads would wear a new 3rd kit, which has not yet been released. Expecting another bizarre kit I was greeted by a very nice looking design, very similar to Inter Milan&amp;rsquo;s. Personally I think it should replace the current yellow design but then again, that won&amp;rsquo;t happen.</description>

      <description>Just as it seems we&amp;rsquo;d be getting good money for our Frenchman Sebastien Bassong, Harry Redknapp has denied the rumours that he&amp;rsquo;s bid £10m for the centre back. Speaking today, Redknapp confirmed that Sebastien is a player he&amp;rsquo;d interested in and will probably bid at some stage for the 23 year-old. Reports were rife today from Sky Sports that an initial bid has been rejected but Harry said he knows nothing about the bid, although he said that he didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;think&amp;rsquo; the chairman, Daniel Levy had submitted the bid without his consent.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s understood, amidst all the takeover speculation and Shearer saga that Newcastle United, have rejected a £10m from Tottenham for Sebastien Bassong. Sky Sports are now reporting this story and if true which we believe it is, £10m is a lot to reject for someone we only paid £500k for last summer. Harry Redknapp is no doubt interested as are Arsenal, and Arsene Wenger has a good lot of cash now that Kolo Touré and Emanuel Adebayor have departed to cash filthy Manchester City.</description>

If you told Newcastle fan this time last year that Habib Beye would be going to Hull and Newcastle would be in the Championship they&amp;rsquo;d either laugh it off or go into serious depression, somehow I&amp;rsquo;d say the first option would be a popular one. Anyway, Hull are interested in Habib Beye and Newcastle are prepared to sell.</description>

      <description>### Martins - Should succeed in Germany
The first of many departures at Newcastle has begun with Obafemi Martins&amp;rsquo;s transfer to Wolfsburg. The Bundesliga champions paid Newcastle €10.5m for the Nigerian and that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad fee to receive. The only thing is, we wonder where the money will go. Into Mike Ashley pocket or back into the club in order to buy new players. We still don&amp;rsquo;t know if there are new owners on the horizon but we certainly hope so as this day week, we play West Brom in the opening game of the Coca Cola Championship.</description>

      <description>Your usual takeover talks goes out the window when you hear something like this. You are stopped in your tracks. When I heard Bobby Robson had died today, it shocked me although I can&amp;rsquo;t say I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it. Sir Bobby, has been battling cancer for the fifth time and eventually, the horrible cause got the better of a true legend. No fan in England won&amp;rsquo;t know that famous name that is Sir Bobby Robson and no one will have a bad word to say about him, simply because he was a gentle, caring man who had football running through his veins</description>

      <description>Keegan - Set for a dramatic return? Indeed when we had given up all hope of finding a new buyer for our club in the last few days, we are hit by an abundance of fresh news but perhaps, some substance to it. Apparently now , an Iranian businessman but the name of Sirous Mahjoob is &amp;lsquo;close to completing&amp;rsquo; the sale of Newcastle United. I did have some notions, as did many of us, that something was going on when Obafemi Martins had reportedly agreed to join Wolfsburg.</description>

      <description>Martins - The goal that nearly kept us up It&amp;rsquo;s well and truly the end of an era when you see Obafemi Martins departing from St.James&amp;rsquo;. Although he had mixed receptions from supporters it was pretty clear he was loved upon Tyneside and will be sorely missed in our front line. Martins scored an abundance of goals in his first season after arriving for £10m and earned Alan Shearer&amp;rsquo;s much coveted #9 shirt for Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Although we know that there probably won&amp;rsquo;t be any new faces arriving this summer to Newcastle United it&amp;rsquo;s irritating to see where the players, that could be Newcastle players, go to different clubs. For example , Kyle Naughton went to Spurs, fair enough, we mighn&amp;rsquo;t have stood much of a chance there, but Daniel Fox went to Celtic, I think we could&amp;rsquo;ve snapped him. Jermaine Beckford has been taken off the transfer list although his agent stated he wanted to join Newcastle pretty much and Simon Cox going to Brom, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure he&amp;rsquo;d be tempted to join Newcastle if he was given the chance.</description>

With the new Coca Cola Championship season only days away we look at players who we think can lead us back to where we belong, the Premier League. When we look for a leader in a team that had the 5th highest wage bill in the Premier, and were relegated, what leaders just shoot out of a bunch of over-paid Prima donnas? There&amp;rsquo;s not many, which is rather alerting.</description>

Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s game at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park for Sir Bobby Robson was a great scene and a very much deserved ovation for the legend that is Sir Bobby. England went on to win the game 3-2 courtesy of a Shearer penalty in which he earned the penalty too. Indeed any time Shearer did get the ball, it was met with a huge roar of excitement and Alan, was looking as sharp as ever.</description>

      <description>Fans - Tired of Ashley and his ownership After an embarrassing defeat to Leyton Orient yesterday it really put a cap on Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s tenure. Probably the biggest friendly loss in a long time, the Newcastle players didn&amp;rsquo;t seem bothered, besides the odd exception. It can&amp;rsquo;t be called anything short of a disgrace and Leyton players were magnificent to say the least. Mind you, Orient are a League 1 side and we have to play many a Championship game this year, who inevitably will be better than Leyton.</description>

      <description>### Fans - Would you think these fans suffered relegation this year?
First of all I like for people to ignore the previous article because it seems the sale of the new jerseys has picked up massively today. Earlier it was reported that a mere 3 people showed to get their new away strip, but that was only in the morning. Since then, and after midday the kids and adults of the town created a long queue and waited to get their new, Newcastle United banana jersey, as well having it signed by the four players who took time to sign it for them.</description>

      <description>Away strip - Not going to sell that well A mere three people queued outside Newcastle United&amp;rsquo;s official store in order to get their new banana away kit. The new release from Newcastle has been met with plenty of jokes from the papers but you can&amp;rsquo;t blame them really. The only thing it signifies for me, is, it&amp;rsquo;s the same colour shirt Newcastle wore when promoted from Division 2 many years ago.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not funny really, how messed up we are. I&amp;rsquo;m not one for shifting the blame and allow things to justify themselves but Mike Ashley&amp;rsquo;s tenure at Newcastle United is far from laughable. The hopes and expectations when he took over were pretty high, the couple of men who voiced their concerns over his takeover were looked on is if they had two heads. Eventually them two guys turned into a group but still, the moderate Toon supporter backed the billionaire owner who invested nearly £300m into their beloved NUFC.</description>

      <description>It seems that the hierarchy have learned nowt over the last season and continue to play their own game, which is affecting all of us. Mike Ashley doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he&amp;rsquo;s doing sadly enough and his puppets aren&amp;rsquo;t much better. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m being a little too harsh on them, after all Ashley did invest a whole lot of money into Newcastle United with very little, no, return. You would have to feel a little sympathy for him in that sense but he made no steps whatsoever to make amends and sort the club and effectively brought the club to it&amp;rsquo;s knees, meaning here we are in the Coca Cola Championship.</description>

      <description>Fans - Where else would you find such fans? We may have suffered the worst in relegation but it could be a mixed blessing for the Toon faithful. We no longer will be paying high earners for sitting on the benches and won&amp;rsquo;t going through managers as if they were skittles - right? We certainly hope things will change but so far the only thing good at the club, are the fans.</description>

      <description>Beye - Fighting for Newcastle in every sense In a one nil victory over Huddersfield Town, in which Kevin Nolan scored the winner, Habib Beye was involved in a HT bust-up with Huddersfield Town captain Peter Clarke. It&amp;rsquo;s not fully clear what happened in the tunnel but it&amp;rsquo;s understood Beye nor Clarke were too happy about each other. Indeed it must have been something quite big as Fabricio Coloccini was too involved in a confrontation after the final whistle.</description>

      <description>Still haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to move out any high earners With the start of the Championship not too far away it&amp;rsquo;s a frightening fact that Newcastle United could be fielding pretty much the same starting eleven that played on the final day in Villa Park, where we suffered relegation. Apart form Owen, Viduka, Edgar and Lovenkrands leaving there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much other developments especially with the new transfer embargo put on Newcastle by &amp;lsquo;owner&amp;rsquo; Mike Ashley.</description>

      <description>Steve McMahon today has confirmed that the group he is leading, or supposedly, have not hit the asking price that Mike has wanted. Mr.Ashley put Newcastle up for sale at the price of £100m and he was quoted as saying, the first person to hit that figure would be the new owners of the club. However Derek Llambias has confirmed that &amp;lsquo;two or more&amp;rsquo; groups have et that asking price, so why hasn&amp;rsquo;t Mike accepted the first £100m bid like he said he would?</description>

      <description>Coloccini - Will stay if his wages remain the same - no thank you Fabricio Coloccini said today that he would consider staying at Newcastle United during our first Coca Cola Championship campaign, but only if he retains his £50,000k + a week. Speaking about a proposed transfer away from the club he said it was basically impossible to leave at the time being because of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s constant uncertainty and the mess we&amp;rsquo;re in right now.</description>

      <description>Taylor - Scored again yesterday with a header After a comprehensive hammering yesterday, Newcastle United are still waiting on new owners and indeed waiting we&amp;rsquo;ve been. It&amp;rsquo;s been well over 40 days since relegation and the only real changes have been players leaving on free contracts. Michael Owen being the most noticeable, scoring the winner on his début in Malaysia. Speaking after the match Chris Hughton indicated he expected an &amp;lsquo;announcement&amp;rsquo; soon and he gave the impression that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be head coach of Newcastle United for much longer.</description>

      <description>Jonas - Netted his first/last Newcastle United goal Newcastle triumphed victorious over a lacklustre Darlington side tonight winning by a solid 5 goals. Goals scored by Shola Ameobi, Kevin Nolan, Jonas Gutierrez, Damien Duff, Andy Carroll and local lad Steve Taylor were enough to see off Dean Windass&amp;rsquo;s solo efforts. It&amp;rsquo;s a good win but the ownership is still yet to be sorted. Maybe this game and indeed the win will show the new potential owners that Newcastle have the ability.</description>

      <description>The main news today regarding the takeover is that Profitable Group have upped their bid for Newcastle United. The last bit we had heard for these was , that they were waiting on a reply about their initial bid which is unknown. However the bid was insufficient and today, they were meant to have bid again, the bid is understood to be less than £100m but indeed covering that price in clauses and installments.</description>

      <description>Sultan - IS he still interested in buying the club? There isn&amp;rsquo;t much happening with Newcastle United at the minute regarding news, it seems the same old news is being regurgitated everyday. Mike Ashley is still looking to sell but he&amp;rsquo;s making the hardest job of it, he was quoted as saying the first £100m offer would seal the club but a few weeks ago Derek Llambias has said that there&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;lsquo;2 or more&amp;rsquo; bids for the club.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have announced , yes announced! that Joe Kinnear won&amp;rsquo;t be returning as manager of the club. In a statement they said talks were ongoing with prospective consortia and that a sale was still in the pipeline. What I can&amp;rsquo;t understand is why, they haven&amp;rsquo;t included in that statement a statement of intent and of what exactly was going on a club. Where the sale was , regarding progress and any time-scale although their predicted times when the deal would be finalised was less than accurate.</description>

You can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the fans for wanting to know everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. A lot are season ticket holders and have paid quite a nice sum of money for that &amp;lsquo;privilege&amp;rsquo; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to call it that. We&amp;rsquo;re forever hearing of new bidders, bidding confusion and maybe no bidders at all.</description>

      <description>The worst has really come , Mike Ashley is reportedly reconsidering his selling position (for the second time) and may well take Newcastle United off the for sale list. This comes as all parties interested in buying have expressed a concern at the finance books at Newcastle and indeed you&amp;rsquo;d expect that. There are so many financial problems at the club, now that we&amp;rsquo;re a Championship Club. Reports indicate that Ashley will remain as owner and Llambias as MD still, however a new Public Relations figure who we don&amp;rsquo;t know just yet.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m taking my mind off the sale today and put together a list of players Newcastle United should sign as they prepare for their first Coca Cola Championship campaign. The main thing I can&amp;rsquo;t understand and you probably can&amp;rsquo;t either, is why Shearer hasn&amp;rsquo;t been appointed manager as the takeover talks continue?</description>

All we&amp;rsquo;ve had are rumours rumours and more rumours. We should be sold by now. Mike Ashley should be no longer in Newcastle, Derek Llambias no longer Managing Director. Mike didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to take complete control of Newcastle from Freddy, so why is it taking so long?</description>

I was eating my breakfast and listening to national radio when I heard Newcastle mentioned. Thinking it was all about the friendly I listened half intently and then I heard some rather staggering news about a new runner for Newcastle United. Charlie Chawke was speaking to the radio channel in Ireland &amp;lsquo;RTE Radio&amp;rsquo; and confirmed to radio host that he is interested in buying Newcastle United.</description>

      <description>Will we ever be sold is the question being asked every day of the week from Newcastle fans, and you yourself may begin to wonder if Mike Ashley will depart from St.James Park anytime soon. However the latest reports are, that Keith Harris, who is working on the Newcastle sale on Seymour Pierce&amp;rsquo;s behalf, has recommended a bidder to Ashley and it&amp;rsquo;s up to Mike to accept or reject. How true these reports are , we don&amp;rsquo;t know but if everything went to plan, Keith Harris would&amp;rsquo;ve reported back to Ashley yesterday evening.</description>

Speaking today to another newspaper, called The Strait Times that the bid has been made and it would be a very good outcome for all parties concerned. As you know McMahon is a former footballer himself and obviously knows the ropes, or so we hope.</description>

On the other hand there&amp;rsquo;s on man that wants to come and that&amp;rsquo;s Jermaine Beckford from Leeds United. Jermaine is quite a decent striker and stands at over 6ft. Leeds have transfer listed him and he wants to leave.</description>

      <description>I know were obviously looking for a new owner first but as the days slip by, so do our potential transfer targets. It seems the other relegated team from the Premier League who are back at home, West Brom, are about the only team moving for players in the transfer window. Simon Cox was Brom&amp;rsquo;s first signing and according to reports he was a Newcastle United target and more so for Alan Shearer.</description>

      <description>Krishnan - Why only deny interest now? Oh lordy, the nonsense continues . One minute Ananda Krishnan is all set to takeover and now he&amp;rsquo;s confirmed he&amp;rsquo;s not interested in buying the club at all. This leaves us questioning everything. Perhaps there is another Malaysian in there? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s an Asian buyer or maybe , just maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that Singaporean group that said they were interested in buying last month.</description>

      <description>The debacle seems to continue on for ever but Mike Ashley is leaving, it&amp;rsquo;s official, although we already knew that, it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in the next couple of days with Ananda Krishnan completing the buyout. indeed £100m isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to the billionaire that is worth just under $8bn and I&amp;rsquo;m sure a £20m transfer budget wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be stretching the bank either 😀 We&amp;rsquo;re expecting a press conference soon about the announcement as the Malaysians are putting the finishing touches to the deal.</description>

      <description>Finally we&amp;rsquo;re nearly there , Mike Ashley is ready to sell Newcastle United and there are three very willing buyers from what we hear. Apparently there are two from Asia and one from America but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure, it&amp;rsquo;s one from Malaysia, one from Singapore and the other from America. The American interest could well be the man I reported on a couple of articles down, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not. The identities are yet to be unveiled but we&amp;rsquo;re more worried about how long it&amp;rsquo;ll take.</description>

      <description>Fans - Maybe, just maybe the nightmare is nearly over Speaking to the Chronicle today, Derek Llambias confirmed that there has been &amp;lsquo;two or more&amp;rsquo; bids for Newcastle United and that makes for very interesting reading indeed. It was reported earlier that the sale might take another 4 weeks, which it could well but since there has been bids received surely it can&amp;rsquo;t take 4 weeks to complete the sale of the club?</description>

According to nufc.com the source believes that Ashley is still trying to scape some money from wherever he can get it and this probably involved selling Obafemi Martins, Fabricio Coloccini, Jonas Gutierrez, Sebastien Bassong and who knows else.</description>

Apparently two bidders are left and Freddy Shepperd is not one of them. A source revealed tonight who the American interest is but it&amp;rsquo;s credibility is very questionable. Speaking to a tabloid paper, bare in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s Sunday, the source revealed that American bidder (if there is one) is a guy by the name of Larry Page who plays a major role in Google.</description>

      <description>Martins - Being forced out of Newcastle even though he wants to stay There are reports that Keith Harris, the guy in charge of selling Newcastle, has told Mike Ashley to accept bids for Fabricio Coloccini and Obafemi Martins to ease the financial strain on himself as the sale of NUFC nears a close. Obafemi Martins who has already said he wants to stay and doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be sold is being forced out and the Journal have confirmed that bids from foreign clubs have been made for both players.</description>

      <description>Despair - Final whistle sounds at Villa Park As depressing as it is to go back on, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked the goal that in my opinion sent Newcastle United down to the Coca Cola Championship. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have your own ideas or maybe you believe I should be writing about the goal that &amp;lsquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t keep us up&amp;rsquo; but then again I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with this one. I remember where I was when I heard it, standing beside a radio hoping to hear &amp;lsquo;The final whistle has gone at St.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s an ironic occurrence what&amp;rsquo;s happening with Michael Owen today. Lil&amp;rsquo; Mo is on the verge of completing a move to Manchester United. From The Coca Cola Championship although he hasn&amp;rsquo;t played a game there yet, to challenging for the Champions League and indeed every other piece of silverware that&amp;rsquo;s on offer this coming season. According to
Owen left United&amp;rsquo;s training grounds (Manchester United&amp;rsquo;s) earlier today and was undergoing a medical.</description>

      <description>There is more news about the mystery Malaysian bidder today, and his name is believed to be Ananda Krishnan a rich foreigner that is worth $7.5bn, a little less than Robert Kuok but certainly a very wealthy man. Reports are surfacing, especially in
The Chronicle that an £80m bid has been submitted and that Seymour Pierce has recommended a buyer to to Mike Ashley already, indeed it&amp;rsquo;s believed to be this man.</description>

      <description>According to BBC Radio, Derek Llambias was showing a Malaysian bidder around St.James&amp;rsquo; Park. This news has only broken so it&amp;rsquo;s in, its infancy details-wise. Apparently the bidder could be a representative of Robert Kuok, who is worth $10bn as of last year. That is some fortune to have, indeed his nickname is &amp;lsquo;Sugar King of Asia&amp;rsquo; because he is responsible for about 10% of the worlds sugar! To make it even better , he&amp;rsquo;s a modest and quiet man that keeps to himself, perfect for Newcastle United if you ask me.</description>

      <description>Tickets - Available for Toon fans Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s first pre-season test will come at Shamrock Rovers on the 11th of July. Newcastle have a strong Irish following or apparently so. Me being one of them :D. However the ticket prices aren&amp;rsquo;t a ridiculous fee and quite reasonable especially for any Irish Newcastle followers. Indeed I might take the 4 hour journey to Tallagh in Dublin myself to see the boys in action.</description>

      <description>Pierce - Moving the sale along we hope Now it seems the sale of Newcastle United will be delayed even longer because Mike Ashley has locked himself in the &amp;lsquo;data&amp;rsquo; room, well not really but it seems that there is yet another &amp;lsquo;slight&amp;rsquo; delay in the sale of NUFC. Apparently there are two consortia interested with both expressing their interest. Also, both groups have shown Derek Llambias, Mike Ashley and Seymour Pierce proof of their funds.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s not the news we&amp;rsquo;re looking for but it&amp;rsquo;s news all the same. David Edgar, Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s backup defender has opted to join newly promoted Burnley on a 4 year deal. Edgar&amp;rsquo;s contract ran out today but it so happened he was offered an extension (by who?) but he didn&amp;rsquo;t like what he saw on it. We wish David the very best of luck and are sure he&amp;rsquo;ll be more than decent for his new side.</description>

      <description>### Shepherd - Front runner for Newcastle takeover? - hopefully not
Surprisingly , the BBC have taken a time out from Wimbledon and have broken a story that I will lead to many. Apparently if all goes well, Newcastle will be sold by then end of the month, but we&amp;rsquo;re nearly there and there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any signs of a takeover happening. However now, as we already know Shepherd is interested and is as reported leading the race with a £60m bid, which is expected to be accepted by Mike Ashley.</description>

      <description>Hughton - Could be made permanent should Ashley&amp;rsquo;s regime continue As the confusion continues and there&amp;rsquo;s still no worthwhile communication it seems that Chris Hughton as scary as this may sound, is favorite to come Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s permanent manager, yes permanent, not interim. The first real bit of action from Newcastle (or someone) was to re appoint Chris Hughton to first team duties and get them organised for their pre-season, staring in Ireland.</description>

      <description>We seem to be missing everything except the headlines nowadays and today there is news that Manchester United and Sunderland have agreed a deal for Fraizer Campbell. Campbell who supposedly was holding off for a Newcastle offer and I think he could have well been, may have changed his mind after no contact from Newcastle about hi status or availability. Campbell would have been a very good signing for Newcastle should be have decided to make a move but then again, no owners, no manager and players who don&amp;rsquo;t know their future, how could we even dare make a move?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a month now since we suffered the worst (you would think) and got relegated. However now, since the club was put up for sale there are as far as we know 3 consortia in talks with Seymour Pierce and are still going through the books at Newcastle. That&amp;rsquo;s all in well but we&amp;rsquo;re expecting the players back for pre-season in a matter of days, with none of them knowing their futures.</description>

Well no really but apparently Spurs are leading the chase to sign the Cameroonian international. We expected high demand for this player and we would be surprised if Arsenal didn&amp;rsquo;t come in and make a suitable offer. Indeed we know Seb wants to leave but how much will he go for is another thing.</description>

      <description>There are reports today that Kevin Keegan who apparently in talks with Southampton, is monitoring Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s situation. Keegan who was Newcastle boss this time last year was forced to resign and from then on, Newcastle fell and eventually our fall was broken with what is, the Championship. We know that Keegan wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take Newcastle for a final time but then again you never know with &amp;lsquo;The Messiah&amp;rsquo;. Southampton are reportedly trying to seal the contract though and we&amp;rsquo;d expect him to end up there.</description>

He opted to join Newcastle United from Real Madrid for a staggering fee of £17m. Most Newcastle fans were delighted as this was a major coup for the Toon. Owen got a heroes welcome when he was showcased in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park and knew he had a lot to do, to repay the grateful support.</description>

It seems that releasing our new kits and Coca Cola Championship badges for the jerseys are more important than announcing a manager or owners. Today Newcastle United released their new away kit and it&amp;rsquo;s the worst one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a long long time at Newcastle. Newcastle United are known for their unique and stylish designs each year and the new home jersey is very nice.</description>

Apparently Newcastle could be sold in about two weeks, according to a source within the club. This is encouraging news and the news that follows would be even better. They expect a managerial announcement (Shearer) by the 28th which would give Shearer time to train the lads, and get rid of some surplus player as well as bring some new ones in.</description>

Sky Sports have confirmed that Sebastien Bassong is in talks with 2 English clubs to return to the Premier League. Bassong was Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s best player of the season last year and it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising to see that he&amp;rsquo;s in demand.</description>

As far as I know , 4 consortiums are in talks and that proof of their finances has been shown. The &amp;lsquo;data room&amp;rsquo; has been opened to those that have shown some real intentions and backed it up with their finances, so we&amp;rsquo;re expecting that an official bid has been launched or it very close. We need it sorted soon and it seems Ashley hasn&amp;rsquo;t learned anything from his torrid time.</description>

These stories are originating from the Chronicle Live which were the only one to be spot on with takeover claims. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope they&amp;rsquo;re right about this one too because these are exactly the players we need if we are to have a successful promotion charge this season.</description>

No one knows what&amp;rsquo;s going on at Newcastle United, Mike Ashley certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. We do know however there are interested buyers and hopefully are getting into advanced stages with talks over a takeover.

What a great way to start the weekend! Obafemi martins, the little Nigerian who cost the club £10m and is a major fans favorite has declared, officially that he is looking to stay with Newcastle United and lead the promotion challenge that will come in the following months. Speaking to Evening Chronicle he today confirmed that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be placed on the transfer market but understands if NUFC have no other choice but to place a for sale tag on the top of his head.</description>

After declaring their interest in Newcastle United Football Club Profitable are yet to make an official bid for the club and reports are suggesting that there is no funds to back up their interest. This is what Newcastle could do without, but we&amp;rsquo;re still pretty confident they&amp;rsquo;ll make a bid for the club very soon. Newcastle need to be sold very quickly of else if could become a terrible terrible affair.</description>

Earlier this morning Derek Llambias has rubbished these rumours and says there has been no contact from this group. He said however, they were in talks with 4 potential buying groups , none of the names disclosed. It seemed a little too perfect what they were saying, making St.James&amp;rsquo; 60,000 seater, Alan Shearer as manager and run it as a similar mould as Barcelona where the fans have a major say.</description>

Of course nothing is ever straight forward with Newcastle and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to wait until mid July before any &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; interest is shown in our club. The man in charge of selling our club has already indicated that there is &amp;lsquo;real and decent&amp;rsquo; interest in Newcastle United Football Club, but we&amp;rsquo;re yet too see any of this yet.</description>

      <description>It might be music to some Toon fans ears, or maybe all but Fabricio Coloccini is set for a move away from Newcastle. The Argie arrived from Deportivo for a staggering fee of £10.3m in the summer when Kevin Keegan was at the helm but with turmoil on and off the pitch Coloccini couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle English top flight football and suffered, badly. There is no doubt that Coloccini is a very good defender in his own right but in fairness to him, the nonsense on and off the pitch was enough to wreck his first Premier League season.</description>

      <description>NUFC - 2 or 3 interested parties It&amp;rsquo;s your usual Sunday goss about Newcastle and there are articles flying everywhere. However we think this is a real one and that it can be from a trusted source. Apparently there are &amp;lsquo;2 or 3&amp;rsquo; parties interested in Newcastle United with Freddy Sheppard one of them. Speaking today Keith Harris, the man given the job to sell the club said there was some &amp;lsquo;real, decent&amp;rsquo; interest in buying Newcastle United and that a deal could well be sorted before July.</description>

      <description>### Smith - Wants to bring Newcastle back to Premier League
Alan Smith admits he feels guilty that Newcastle United were relegated from the Premier League and feels as if he was one of the causes. Smith arrived from Man United for £6m, another Allardyce signing but has never had a permanent spot in Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s first 11. Smith says he will stay at Newcastle and hopefully bring them back up to where they deserve to be, the Barclays Premier League.</description>

      <description>Enrique - Flattered by Madrid interest Speaking today Jose Enrique said he was flattered by interest shown in him by Atletico Madrid and indeed other clubs across Europe. Enrique who had a dodgy start to his Newcastle career has since shown in stages, why he cost £6.25m but still, it seems we got a little ripped off again. Big Sam Allardyce bought him when in charge but Keegan and Shearer seemed to get the best out of him.</description>

      <description>I honestly think that Coloccini is still a good player and will refind his form he once had at Deportivo should he leave or stay. With that aside, if Colo leaves he will surely be one of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s biggest flops in history? He was terrible for the majority of the season, his two best games were the first game of the season v Manchester United and the last game of the season v Aston Villa.</description>

      <description>Owen - Can join new club for nothing now He joined for £17m in what was a major coup for Newcastle United Football club, although we paid a little over the odds for him he was still Michael Owen, the exciting center forward who bagged loads of goals each season. We got to forget that Michael, the one we know now is a slower, less alert finisher that bags £108,000 a week rather than goals.</description>

Reports over the last few days have suggested that Jermaine Beckford could arrive to St.James&amp;rsquo; as Shearer&amp;rsquo;s first signing. Beckford who plays for Leeds is a center forward, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know. He&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, tall and quite fast and his intentions are to leave Leeds United this summer. Joining Newcastle would be a big move up for the lad and we can&amp;rsquo;t see him resisting a all from the Magpies.</description>

      <description>Martins - Everton, Arsenal and Villa apparently after him There are reports and of course they were only a matter of time that, Obafemi Martins will leave NUFC soon. The Nigerian who played through the pain barrier in hope of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s safety, is the target or Aston Villa, Arsenal and now Everton. Indeed there will be no shortage of teams looking to sign Martins with his pace, agility and ability however they will also know that Oba needs an operation and should they wait for him to have it at Newcastle it could be too late for a a summer signature.</description>

Today, Lovenkrands agent has said that Peter is set for talks with the club over his future.</description>

It saw an owner who wanted to sell then didn&amp;rsquo;t , because he couldn&amp;rsquo;t, 4 different managers, the departure of a Messiah and his replacement nearly leaving in another way.

Taking it on his left he generated as much power as he could, smashing it past Paul Robinson and luckily enough didn&amp;rsquo;t burst the net! It was a great goal and a great victory that day but now that we&amp;rsquo;re a Championship team, players must go and Oba seems the first out the door.</description>

For two days in a row and for 6-7 hours straight both parties met. It&amp;rsquo;s a meeting over whether Alan Shearer will stay as Newcastle boss and what indeed the plans are for Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Championship campaign coming up in August. Mike Ashley is a less than popular character around Newcastle with most people blaming him for the relegation of one of the biggest club in England.</description>

After a dreadful season and the worst the club could suffer, relegation Mike Ashley yesterday apologized to the Newcastle faithful for his terrible ownership and today
Sky Sports reported that Ashley is looking to sell following the relegation. Indeed Ashley&amp;rsquo;s bank account is shrinking by the day with Newcastle United and it&amp;rsquo;s best for both parties that he sells, a new start for Newcastle United and a financial break for Mike Ashley himself.</description>

      <description>The demise of Newcastle United is a sad story and very sad one indeed. Once an extremely powerful force in English Football, the Magpies have plundered to the lowest of the low, occupying an automatic relegation seat, and only one game left in the entire season to save it. I&amp;rsquo;m sick of the constant nonsense that has happened with Newcastle, the ownership, the poor performances and the instability. We&amp;rsquo;ve had our chances to get safe, Stoke away, Pompey at home, and recently Fulham at home.</description>

Hitting 50 points in the league is a brilliant achievement and credit is due to Roy Hodgson and his players for turning it around at Craven Cottage.</description>

There are stories today originating from a less than credible newspaper today, that Newcastle are keeping tabs on Paul Scharner, the Wigan midfielder. I&amp;rsquo;m suspecting these reports are utter nonsense but never the less I&amp;rsquo;ll report on them, considering it involved NUFC. Perhaps the connection between Scharner and Newcastle is the fact he indeed scored the goal to keep Wigan in the Premier League those years ago.</description>

After wrecking our chance against Pompey at St.James&amp;rsquo; the lads were determined that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen again. However after 3 minutes you couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if we were in for the same rigmarole but when Danny Guthrie&amp;rsquo;s great corner was met by an even better header by local lad Steven Taylor you just got the feeling it had to be our night.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Hoping for early goal tomorrow Tomorrow is the night for the biggest game in Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s long long history. indeed history will be made at 10pm on Monday night when either the Toon or Boro could leapfrog Hull and reside outside the relegation zone for at least another week. Then again if both team happen to draw than their fate will more than likely destined for the Coca Cola Championship and that is a place where no team want to go, especially teams of Newcastle and Middlesbrough&amp;rsquo;s size.</description>

      <title>Alan Shearer thinks Mark Viduka will be main man v Middlesbrough</title>

      <description>How suiting it would be should Mark Viduka score the winner or at least play a major role on Monday as Newcastle face their lesser rivals in a bid to avoid relegation. Viduka hasn&amp;rsquo;t been the most consistent performer this season with very little performances but since his comeback against Tottenham, he has looked quiet decent indeed. There is no doubt that Viduka can score goals as well as use his best skill, holding up play to boost Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s chances come Monday.</description>

      <description>### Beye - Believes that Toon can survive
Prominent wingback and makeshift center back Habib Beye believes Newcastle United can remain a Premier League club if they manage 7 points from their last three games. That&amp;rsquo;s the equivalent of 2 wins and a draw, Fulham and Boro spring to mind as possible wins with a draw away to Villa next priority. Whether we can really get 2 wins in succession is beyond me or anyone else who follows football but you&amp;rsquo;d have to doubt it.</description>

On Monday night at around 10pm we will knows Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s Premier League situation, if we are to lose it&amp;rsquo;s goodbye to our Premier League campaign, if we win, there will be some confidence and hopefully enough to aspire another win if not two. Shearer insists that Joey Barton is nowhere near his or the teams thoughts as they prepare for battle against another team, desperately fighting for their survival this season.</description>

      <description>Duff - Biggest game in his career The time is ticking towards the Middlesbrough game, when the whistle sounds at St.James&amp;rsquo; the nail biting will have begun, on both sets of fans. This is without a doubt the biggest game Newcastle United have played in 16 years of football on Tyneside. Who thought that such a well supported side that used challenge for all major trophys , would be stuck in the thick of a relegation battle.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that Alan Shearer has been a hit with both fans and players as he enters his 3 last games in charge of Newcastle United. Shearer who is from Newcastle himself, played for Newcastle and wore the prestigious captains armband, is wanted, by the players, as full time manager. Poor Alan hasn&amp;rsquo;t had the best of times in charge but is doing all he can to save Newcastle United FC, alongside another man by the name of Habib Beye</description>

      <description>Shearer - Doing all he can to save NUFC The days are long gone when we used to put it up to the big four. Long gone are the days when we we&amp;rsquo;re challenging for Europe and it also seems that the days are gone when we used to score goals. 1 goal in our last five with 2 of them at home. When Shearer took over at Newcastle there was a atmosphere of excitement and expectation.</description>

      <description>Another loss and another Joey Barton moment. Does this guy know when he has life good? After getting off the hook from an assault, getting out of prison early and getting backing from NUFC he still continues to shame the team he plays for. Not to mention we pay his £45,000 + a week wages. He had kept quiet for the whole game until he couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist clattering into Xabi Alonso.</description>

He today confessed that he was an amid fan of Sky Sports programmes and relished to see how other teams got on, however he now insists that he won&amp;rsquo;t be dragged into viewing the TV for the sake of NUFC.</description>

      <description>### Players - Need to show they&amp;rsquo;re worth their wages
We&amp;rsquo;ll be going to Liverpool very soon and we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking for a point. Shearer has today said that the team are going there with the attitude that we can get all 3 points but in fairness that won&amp;rsquo;t happen. It&amp;rsquo;s good to see the lads are optimistic heading into one of the highest scoring teams in the league but if you do the maths, we won&amp;rsquo;t be getting anything from this game.</description>

      <description>### Bassong - Deserves to stay up
Sebastien Bassong who has been our best player throughout the season still thinks Newcastle can beat the drop and propel themselves to safety. Arriving from France for as little as 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rsquo;s of a million, Sebastien has aspired to Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s best center back this season, if not one of the best center backs in the Premier League. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m a little too biased! However he&amp;rsquo;s been a brilliant figure this season and will get snapped up if we go down, which seems more and more likely.</description>

      <description>Barton - Itching to come back Joey Barton could well make the long awaited comeback for Newcastle at the trip to Liverpool. Joey was expected to feature against Portsmouth but didn&amp;rsquo;t come off the bench. He is just after recovering from a foot injury and we&amp;rsquo;ve missed his bit in midfield. Nicky Butt has done a good job but the legs are getting heavy, Butt has played a lot of football in his day.</description>

      <description>Newcastle - Relegation looms We all hoped for a victory yesterday and what did we get? A point, a pretty useless one at that. We needed all 3 without a doubt but dreadfully poor finishing from Michael Owen and Obafemi Martins couldn&amp;rsquo;t nab us that goal we needed. We didn&amp;rsquo;t start with that spark that was needed, or that bite that was required. We did however push fairly high up and for the majority of the half, there was only one team playing and that was Newcastle.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s excluding the millions that will watch from abroad such as myself. We all know that if we don&amp;rsquo;t get all 3 points tonight against Portsmouth then we&amp;rsquo;re heading down because I can&amp;rsquo;t see us staying up even if we win our remaining 2 homes game after that. We have a good record against Pompey, with Shearer&amp;rsquo;s milestone being against this very team.</description>

After the weekends results which included Hull getting beaten 3-1 by Liverpool, West Brom pulling off a major shock hammering Sunderland 3-0 and Middlesbrough looked destined for defeat at the Emirates. 3 points no excuses is what tomorrow demands as we may well be able to escape this relegation battle.</description>

Beye who is just back from injury has made an impression at the back already, most notibly against Spurs where he was excellent. Toon fans love Habib because he cares about the club and especially the fans, he wants to keep us up and they are the type of players we need.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately it seems Joey Barton will not make a return for Newcastle on Monday as he has not yet regained his full fitness. He failed to show up for a reserves match yesterday, not because he decided not to go, but because he wasn&amp;rsquo;t physically able. Joey is a massive player for us because he knows us for sticking by him. He has said many times that he wants to repay us for the faith kept in him but really you&amp;rsquo;d have the believe that it was Keegan&amp;rsquo;s stance that did eventually keep the controversial midfielder at Newcastle.</description>

He came on a controversial free, from Mallorca and they are still very frustrated at how he was snatched from them.</description>

      <description>Local lad Carroll didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a chance against Tottenham and was curtailed was Michael Dawson, the question now, is whether he&amp;rsquo;ll start against Portsmouth. He has no reason to be be dropped but Shearer has hinted at Owen, Martins and Viduka all starting upfront. I think Carroll should start because his ability in the air will be crucial on Monday. Martins is really the only other striker there that can leap a great height to nod one home for Newcastle.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s good to see we&amp;rsquo;ll be still sponsored by Adidas even if we do get relegated.

On Monday we&amp;rsquo;ll be facing Portsmouth in a must win game. That game could decide out fate this season and most people know this. The good news today is that Jose Enrique and the famous Joey Barton will be returning for that Monday evening. Barton has been missed in midfield without a doubt as we lack so much creativity, Joey isn&amp;rsquo;t a Ronaldinho, Deco or Riquelme but he can pass and will hopefully provide something from our front 2&amp;frasl;3.</description>

If we have stability at the club and a permanent manager, we&amp;rsquo;d be midtable, easily. However we&amp;rsquo;re in a really tough relegation battle which coudl well go down to teh last day of teh season. I have no problem if it goes down to the last day just as long as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide our furture and we&amp;rsquo;re safe by then.</description>

In a story of two seasons from Hull and 4 seasons for us the Premier League&amp;rsquo;s relegation candidates could be decided on the last day like it was last year with Fulham staying up. We were already safe with King Kev at the helm but how were we to know that same time next year it would be us. Hull, currently in free-fall suffered another defeat on Saturday at the hands of Sunderland.</description>

Today we went to Tottenham, and inform Tottenham who were in sublime form coming into this match. From the first minute you could see Spur&amp;rsquo;s confidence on the ball, passing it about cleanly and easily. We had a few got phases of passing too but the stray ball signaled the tension with the Newcastle players.</description>

Ginola has watched from a distance as his once mighty Toon Army have dropped to a terrible state. He thinks that Shearer can keep them up and he&amp;rsquo;s not the only person to say so. It seems everyone believes Shearer can keep them up as do we, but it will be a very tough task if we manage to stay in the Premier League.</description>

      <description>Barton - Can add to our relegation battle It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before Joey Barton is wearing the Newcastle United jersey again and for me, the sooner the better. He might be a thug and there is no soft explanation for what he has done in the past but he can add big time to saving NUFC from relegation this season. Costing £5.8m from Man City and has played roughly around 31 times with two goals to his name, both penalties, one on the last minute v Fulham and his last one against West Brom in a 3-1 win.</description>

      <description>Guthrie - Ready to beat the drop alongside Nolan Danny Guthrie today, in preparation for the Spurs game on Sunday says he&amp;rsquo;s ready to fight at White Hart Lane and indeed everywhere else they go this season. He thinks that Kevin Nolan can help guide us out of the danger zone with his experience. Guthrie played with Nolan at Bolton and they both know each other&amp;rsquo;s game. Maybe both should start in center mid on Sunday and perhaps Nicky Butt just behind them.</description>

      <description>After a great header on Saturday last against Stoke, Big Andy is ready to start against Tottenham and hopefully score a couple of goals. We need all three points but then again, that&amp;rsquo;s been the story of our season so far. We have finally reached the 30 point mark but Boro are level with us. They have a home game against Fulham and you&amp;rsquo;d nearly fancy Middlesbrough for that one despite Fulham&amp;rsquo;s good away form.</description>

      <description>Martins - Important to Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s survival Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s assistant manager Iain Dowie insists that Oba Martins is a very important figure to Newcastle United and our survival hopes this season. Martins suspiciously pulled out of the game at Stoke at 11am complaining of a groin strain and Shearer didn&amp;rsquo;t seemed best pleased at that considering he had worked on a system all week in preparation for the visit to the Britannia.</description>

We all miss Shay Given between the sticks at St.James&amp;rsquo; but it was time for him to go and to try get some success with another club. Shay is without a doubt one of the best keepers in the world and saved NUFC on so many occasions. He left at the right time, when Newcastle were about hit the toughest period in a long long time.</description>

      <description>Ranger - Shearer might give him a chance to shine Alan Shearer has today said that he is not afraid to give Toon youngster Nile Ranger a chance at the big time as they travel to Spurs on Sunday. Ranger who has been in fantastic form throughout the season for both U-18&amp;rsquo;s and reserves has been on the first team bench for a good few games now. However Joe Kinnear said he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give the lad a chance at a time when cool heads are needed but with Shearer as manager, he said he&amp;rsquo;s more than willing to start anyone who he thinks can do well.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Will get it right Alan Shearer didn&amp;rsquo;t look best pleased before the Stoke game when the team was announced. Shola Ameobi started upfront alongside Michael Owen, apparently because Martins had a slight groin strain, which he called in, injured at 11am on match day. Calling in at that time is a little unacceptable to be honest considering where we are in the league and we need points fast.</description>

      <description>Sbragia - In a similar situation to Shearer Well it&amp;rsquo;s a pity we&amp;rsquo;re here, our Premier League status hanging in the balance. Never in a long long time have we witnessed such a tight League as such and it&amp;rsquo;s going to come right down the the wire for all clubs involved. It has been a very odd Premier League campaign from start to finish with so little breathing space for any team in it, we have suffered so much here at Newcastle from a poor ownership to poor performances.</description>

      <description>First of all, well done Andy Carroll, straight from the bench to head home beautifully and rescue us a point. However we needed all three. We were extremely poor today and Stoke no better. Stoke&amp;rsquo;s plan was obvious, from kick off try win throw ins to allow Delap to do his thing either that, or they&amp;rsquo;d settle for a corner. The lads created one chance really throughout the game and local lad Carroll put it away, indeed the goal was all Andy&amp;rsquo;s as he had to well and truly finish it off.</description>

      <description>Carroll - Could be given a start tomorrow After signing a new deal not so long ago, local lad Andy Carroll has expressed his determination to do well for Newcastle and keep them up with goals. Although he hasn&amp;rsquo;t started a huge chunk of the season he&amp;rsquo;s got a couple of goals to show, including a great header against West Ham and a tap in v the richest team in the world, Manchester City.</description>

Shearer said that he hopes what the lads have practiced in training can be replicated at the Britannia on Saturday afternoon. It seems Shearer is confident and that the players are performing well at training for him but there is one place and one place only we need their best performances and that&amp;rsquo;s on the pitch.</description>

      <description>Stoke - Tough place to go and play football Well it&amp;rsquo;s a must win game for us really when we travel to Stoke, Stoke themselves are in a little troubles themselves but we&amp;rsquo;re in a worst case scenario which in truth we don&amp;rsquo;t deserve to be. Shearer as manager has made some Geordies forget the economic recession and the goings on with NUFC in the year 2008 but we all know the look of the premier League table, lying in the danger zone, somewhere no teams want to be at this stage of the season, 7 games left.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Loving role as manager Although he&amp;rsquo;s probably in the most pressurizing job in the Premier League, local lad Alan Shearer says he&amp;rsquo;s loving life as manager of his boyhood team. Newcastle travel to Stoke in hope for all 3 points but as much as Shearer says he feels the pressure, he says life as manager of Newcastle United couldn&amp;rsquo;t be better. There isn&amp;rsquo;t as much pressure on him as there would be on Kinnear as Shearer is a legend and will forever have that status on Tyneside.</description>

      <description>Enrique - Who will take his place at left back? Bad news today as Shearer has confirmed that José Enrique and Steven Taylor will miss Saturday&amp;rsquo;s vital clash with Stoke at the Britannia. This is not good news at all as firstly we are lacking good defensive players and secondly who will fill Enrique&amp;rsquo;s void at left back? This news may alter Shearer&amp;rsquo;s tactics and he may well be forced to play 3 at the back in a more attacking side.</description>

      <description>Iain Dowie has come out today and talked about the important game at Stoke and the approach that the Magpies will take to it. Dowie knows the importance of the game itself and what either a win or loss could do to Newcastle United and it&amp;rsquo;s Premier League survival hopes. Many pundits have fancied us to go down but Dowie believes himself and Alan can lead the Magpies to safety. It&amp;rsquo;s been a big change in things with the club but I think Ashley has made a good decision in appointing Shearer and it seems that he&amp;rsquo;ll allow Big Al to do it the way he wants.</description>

      <description>### Kinnear - Recovering well but not returning this season
Good news that Joe is recovering well from his heart operation and that he is returning to full strength. However Kinnear won&amp;rsquo;t be returning as manager of Newcastle United this season, instead he will return in the Summer when hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll still be a Premier League team. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious the board want no further disruptions to the club as we enter the most important stage of our season that we have witnessed in a long long time.</description>

As it stands 17,18 and 19th position are occupied by all Northern English teams. Sunderland, Newcastle and Middesbrough. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say much for the football up North but in fairness none of the above teams should be where they are.</description>

After a pretty lacklustre performance against Chelsea last week Shearer knows, the players know and we know that 3 points is essential against The Potters on Saturday. Stoke themselves are in a little trouble of their own but in a more comfortable position than we are, although they don&amp;rsquo;t really deserve to be where they are, they have fought like lions and Rory Delap has lead them to where they are now.</description>

The team spirit was excellent yesterday as we all prepare for a nervy Premier League clash v Stoke. Shearer himself scored a couple in the training session to the delight of the 7500 fans that gathered in St.James&amp;rsquo; on a sunny afternoon. It gave the Geordies a while to forget the recession and to watch their Newcastle heroes.</description>

St.James&amp;rsquo; Park allowed local fans in today, to see Alan Shearer train the Newcastle United first team. In what was quite a pleasant day, Toon fans both young and old got a lengthy glimpse of what they might expect in the forthcoming Stoke match on Saturday.

It had been reported that he might even make a return v Stoke but it won&amp;rsquo;t happen, no so quickly. In fairness, we have missed Barton, one man who shows a fighting spirit on the field and someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to get stuck in.</description>

Like throwing our 2-0 deficit away against Stoke, and conceding a late late equaliser against Wigan.</description>

      <description>### Guthrie - Injured tonight in reserve game
Well just as things seem to get better, they get worse. A reserve game tonight saw Danny Guthrie hobble off and putting a damper on the result tonight. Danny Guthrie is a very important member of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s relegation plans and is one of the faster center midfielders we have at the time being. Joey Barton is expected to make some sort of return in the near future but it seems, should Guthrie have injured himself seriously, that we&amp;rsquo;ll be left with Nicky Butt and Kevin Nolan in the center of the park.</description>

If we beat Stoke on Saturday, not only will it be our first win in some time but it will be a turning point for Shearer&amp;rsquo;s stint I should think. If we win say 2-0 our goal difference will be -13, Sunderland who are 3 points ahead of us are playing Manchester United next. With United&amp;rsquo;s dramatic win against Villa on Sunday you would expect a win at the Stadium of Light.</description>

Well it seems that Shearer isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to change things around and it seems that Fabricio Coloccini will be first to feel the wrath of the new boss. Coloccini has been in poor form all season bar his debut against Manchester United where he looked worthy of all the £10.3m we paid for him. However he has been at fault for many of our goals including Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s first on Saturday.</description>

      <description>Bassong - Has been a great signing for Newcastle Our best center back all season Sebastien Bassong is fully backing Shearer and says he has brought a much needed lift to the club. Bassong himself arrived from Metz for a fee of £750k has turned out to be not only Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s best defender all season but probably one the of the best finds in the premier League all season. His partner Fabrizio Coloccini hasn&amp;rsquo;t lived up to the pace and expectations of the Premier League following his £10.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Has full backing of board and fans You know where you were when you heard it, when the news broke that the great Alan Shearer, once Newcastle captain and highest goalscorer to date, had taken charge of a beleaguered Newcastle United football team. I was just about to depart to bed thinking about the upcoming Chelsea game and how we could combat the likes of Lampard and Essien in the center.</description>

      <description>### Lovenkrands - Ok and will be alright
Peter Lovenkrands took a little knock it seemed against Chelsea yesterday. The contact seemed minimal but the Dane struggles to recover and was replaced by Damien Duff after a few minutes of trying to recuperate on the sidelines. He was rushed to hospital geared with a breathing apparatus and was stable in hospital last night, Shearer confirmed. The extent of the injury is still unknown but it is believe he was finding it very difficult to breath and his gasps were painful.</description>

      <description>Shearer - More concerned about beating teams around us When we lose to Chelsea 2-0 at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park you&amp;rsquo;d expect a normal day. However this day with a new manager and 8 games left to save their season was something different. Something big was expected. However what we expected didn&amp;rsquo;t come, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge atmosphere or any great ordeal, why? because we have to beat the teams around us and the like of Stoke, Spurs, Boro and Pompey are more important games.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Already laying down markers Already Shearer, as you would expect is making changes that will hopefully mean our survival in the Premier League. Today he has banned all players from going out and drinking until the end of the season and this seems very appropriate as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. This will mean all players will hopefully be on their best possible game and inevitably guide us to safety.</description>

      <description>Well, what a change to Newcastle United in less than 48 hours. We were all concentrating on the Chelsea match hoping for Chris Hughton&amp;rsquo;s first win, excluding Joe Kinnear&amp;rsquo;s absence at West Brom. However now, less than 2 days away from that big game we have Alan Shearer as manager , Ian Dowie as assistant and Dennis Wise is no longer. What a change! In my opinion it&amp;rsquo;s for the best and if Big Al can&amp;rsquo;t save us, no one can.</description>

      <description>Wise - Leaving Newcastle can only be a good thing? In a somewhat bizarre turn of events with Newcastle Wise is the latest to leave his seat at Newcastle. Today it was confirmed that Alan Shearer would be taking over for the remaining 8 games of the season in the hope of keeping us afloat in the Premier League. In my opinion we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have got a better man who knows the club, the history the fans and most importantly the game inside out.</description>

      <description>Shearer - Widely reported to be taking control of Newcastle It&amp;rsquo;s an April fool , I&amp;rsquo;m loving it for one. Alan Shearer is becoming the Newcastle boss for the rest of the season. It has been widely reported on Sky Sports News, with North East correspondent David Craig issuing the news first. He himself has said it would be highly unlikely but what a prospect it is for Shearer to become the Newcastle boss!</description>

Good news today as Derek Llambias has confirmed that Newcastle don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about going into administration. He has come out today after rumours suggesting that Newcastle would go into administration, were published from the usual crappy Sunday papers. Of course these headlines grab attention and indeed sales for teh papers but how convenient it is that all the bad rumours have to be about Newcastle.</description>

      <description>More news now that the crappy tabloid love to write, to try unsettle the Newcastle players and board again. it is reported that should Newcastle be relegated come May, then the mighty NUFC will go into administration and face severe trouble in maintaining the club. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much from this as more than likely it is more of the brown stuff but then again Newcastle fans will be reading it and starting to worry.</description>

      <description>### Turner - Reported to be on Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s summer list
Reports today have suggested that Newcastle are trailing Michael Turner, Hull&amp;rsquo;s solid center back. Turner has been in great form for the Tigers this season chipping in with no less than 6 goals. Standing at 6&amp;rsquo;4 he has been great from corners this season. The former Brentford man would be perfect for us, alongside Bassong and I think he would jump at the chance to play for us should we stay in The Premier League this season.</description>

Danny Guthrie has come out today and issued a rallying call to all his fellow troops at Newcastle, claiming that the players are to blame for the poor form. We have saw some terrible performances from this Newcastle side this season, with no fingers pointing at the defeat to Liverpool, although Liverpool were fantastic that day. We weren&amp;rsquo;t good at Bolton or Blackburn and the list goes on and on however that was then and this is now.</description>

I have no doubt that we are the greatest fans in England and certainly the Premier League. We are a big club with a big stadium and massive fans. We deserve better and hopefully if we stay in the Premier League this season we can expect better next season as surely it can&amp;rsquo;t get any worse than the current season.</description>

      <description>### Taylor - Not as bad as expected while Bassong could return too
Good news today on the injury front as Steven Taylor who hobbled off against Arsenal last week could make a return for teh Chelsea game. We all thought that it was a serious injury and he nearly convinced us it was with the pain on his face he was showing! However it is reported to be a bruised ankle and that it&amp;rsquo;s not as serious as first thought.</description>

      <description>Bassong - Will be sorely missed in Chelsea game There is some bad news today that both local lad Steven Taylor and our best center back this season, Sebastien Bassong could be out for some time as both suffered nasty injuries v Arsenal on Saturday. Taylor who was excellent on Saturday, blocking a definite van Persie goal before blocking out Arshavin in similar circumstances. Taylor however picked up a injury and was taken off, 10 men played for Newcastle when Diaby scored an important goal which effectively ended the game for the Toon.</description>

      <description>Where to start? Newcastle are in trouble, quite deep trouble indeed. Although the Daily Mail claim we&amp;rsquo;re all ready relegated (How do they know these things?) there is sign of hope for us after today&amp;rsquo;s game. We pushed form the start and were all over the Gunners. Finally our persistence was rewarded when Ryan Taylor was fouled by Almunia ending in a penalty. However what could go wrong, went wrong, an extremely poor penalty from Obafemi Martins easily saved by Almunia to his low left.</description>

Beye, who suffered a terrible ankle injury by a man well known for his horrific challenges Lee Cattermole is warmed to amongst the Toon fans (Beye that is). To be honest it is Beye who we have really missed at RB although Steven Taylor has done a very good job there too, chipping in with a few goals and assists (Winning the penalty v Sunderland).</description>

Beardsley who is heavily involved at Newcastle, attending the training ground has said following talks to Mike Ashley that Ashley himself has the best of the club at heart and plans for a turn in fortunes providing we stay in the Premier League. We like the sound of this very much indeed or me at least but our Premier League safety is the key issue at the minute.</description>

Also in his comments he said that he would ignore all speculation from Arsenal for now at least as he focuses to play and get goals for the Magpies, lets hope he certainly does. When speaking he also said he is &amp;lsquo;proud&amp;rsquo; to play for the Toon and that he respects the fans kind gestures towards him at matches.</description>

Nolan who got deservedly sent off after nearly breaking Victor Anichebe&amp;rsquo;s leg returns and says that his frustration will come out on Arsenal, let&amp;rsquo;s hope he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean physically!

Another crappy Sunday tabloid paper reported that Kinnear may not return at all this season and a replacement could be lined up quite soon. Kinnear who fell ill before the only win we&amp;rsquo;ve had in some time now at West Brom has successfully recovered or well on his way to recovering from major heart surgery.</description>

      <description>Taylor - Scored a nice goal today but disappointment with result When we heard Geovanni had scored after 8 minutes we all sank into our seats. It was the worst start we could get off to and even the fact Blackburn conceded early on it didn&amp;rsquo;t cheer me up. I knew there was time to score but I hoped that a second Hull goal wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the horizon. Geovanni came close to getting a second too but 7 minutes from half time local lad Steven Taylor equalised and couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it at a better time, 1-1 HT as we all hoped for a good and more importantly an improved second half performance from our team and we got that, only problem is, we didn&amp;rsquo;t capitalise and get a winner.</description>

The Hull game is absolutely vital and a win is very necessary or we&amp;rsquo;re into deeper trouble. A draw would be next to useless for us to be totally honest. Nicky Butt has come out and said it himself that a win is crucial and to be honest we&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of time for preparation which is good.</description>

Today we&amp;rsquo;ve been told from various media sources that Newcastle were after Tom Huddlestone in January and we are expected to pursue him again in the Summer which will be quite pleasing to any Newcastle fans like myself 😀 Reports suggest we made a bid for him after the City game in which Barton got injured 🙁 however the approach was rejected from old Harry and we decided to go and snap Kevin Nolan up instead and in my opinion we didn&amp;rsquo;t lower our standard of quality when choosing Nolan 😀</description>

Sebastien Bassong has spoken today about rumours linking him with Arsenal and despite the crappy tabloids claiming he&amp;rsquo;s all ready to join Arsenal in the summer is nonsense, let&amp;rsquo;s just get that straight first. He did however confirm his agent approached him about some interest from Arsenal however Arsené Wenger hasn&amp;rsquo;t said a word about it. We all know Bassong by now, the best Newcastle defender all season and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise anyone that he could be attracting interest from bigger clubs.</description>

      <description>### Guthrie - Missing in midfield for some time now
Good news today as it is emerging that Xisco, Duff, Viduka, Owen and Guthrie could all return for the vital clash against Hull, a fortnight tomorrow. It is still unknown whether Beye will make the trip as he is recovering from one of Lee Cattermole&amp;rsquo;s many terrible challenges this season. Barton, Beye, Digard,and more recently Scott Parker? Perhaps just a little too common in his poor tackling?</description>

      <description>### Lovenkrands - Scored last night to tear Van der Sar&amp;rsquo;s recore to tatters 😛
I think we can all say when Peter Lovenkrands tapped the ball into the net at St.James&amp;rsquo; Park after 9 minutes last night we all were ecstatic, it came as a shock to us but to Alex Ferguson and Edwin Van der Sar. The Dutch man only needed to keep a clean sheet for another 89 minutes before the Newcastle game and it looked pretty straight forward, from a Newcastle fan&amp;rsquo;s perspective too.</description>

      <description>To be honest I&amp;rsquo;m sick of hearing and seeing it all over the papers, of us going down, or of us in turmoil etc. There is no doubt we are in a position that isn&amp;rsquo;t comfortable but to say we&amp;rsquo;re about to exit the Premier League is sad, really sad. We look at Stoke for example, they have done well so far but have played, shall we call it football? all season which doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow teams to play, only United have unlocked them, who we happen to be playing next week 😀 We will score goals, we will get wins and most importantly we will resume our Premier League status in May.</description>

Some confusion surrounds Jonas&amp;rsquo;s story as it seamed we had done so sleek business by snatching him however no it seems the Toon may be regretting something and are willing a rumoured fee of £4m for the Argentine, still goods business if you ask me!</description>

      <description>Good news today for Toon fans as Mike Ashley has decided to cut Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s ticket prices by up to 9%. A change in price has been inevitable and receives a warm welcome to the loyal Toon fans. The fans of NUFC has been brilliant and I speak as an Irish man who sees St.James&amp;rsquo; beaming with Black and White, it&amp;rsquo;s a great great sight and the players respect it so much.</description>

      <description>Nolan - Deservedly sent off for an awful challenge On a day where the theme was of rivalry although not normally, tackles flew in, from Newcastle players to say the least. The above picture shows Nolan&amp;rsquo;s tackle on Anichebe which rightly got him sent off after 44 minutes at St.James&amp;rsquo;. A terrible challenge from a player who is very important to Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s survival this year. Unfortunately now, that will mean Nolan will miss three important games upcoming.</description>

Jonas Gutierrez has promised that when he does finally score his first goal for Newcastle that a real celebration will be on it&amp;rsquo;s way to the Geordies. Hopefully when he does score it will be in St.James&amp;rsquo; Park in front of all the brilliant fans that he has so much respect for and alike.
We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for Jonas to start scoring because his runs and dashes are very exciting indeed, only a one goal is needed until that mask will be worn with use.</description>

      <description>### Sir Bobby - Thanks ever so much for all the memories
Today is the birthday of one of Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s biggest legends, Sir Bobby Robson. The legend of the Toon is 76 today and his fond memories will be remembered for a long time, indeed he probably managed one of the most successful Newcastle teams and ever since he was sacked because we lost 4-2 to Aston Villa, the team has slumped and we&amp;rsquo;ve gone through managers like Chocolate buttons.</description>

      <description>Good news today as Obafemi Martins, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith will all return for the Everton game as St.James&amp;rsquo; which promises to be a important battle to say the least. We need the win, Everton would like it too, but Everton&amp;rsquo;s away form is not going to dent their confidence considering they have played, on occasions, a lot better on the road then at home.
The good news is, Martins with his rampant pace and Viduka with his odd goal here and there will come in handy as the Premier League&amp;rsquo;s season finale approaches.</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have issued an official statement on Joe Kinnear’s bypass surgery tomorrow.
Newcastle United can confirm that manager Joe Kinnear will undergo a triple heart bypass operation tomorrow.
Joe was admitted to hospital on Saturday morning in the Midlands after reporting of feeling unwell at the team’s hotel ahead of the game at West Bromwich Albion.
Tests have since confirmed Joe requires surgery, after which he will need to rest for a period of at least eight weeks.</description>

      <description>Lots of things happened at Newcastle today mainly because Derek Llambias has opened his mouth. Most are positive vibes mind you. Llambias informed us of what players we were really after at the start of 2009. Here are the few we definitely made enquiries about :
 Michael Johnston
 Nedum Onuoha
 Elano
 Albin Ebondo
 Kieran Richardson
  This is good news and even better is, that we&amp;rsquo;ll be going after some of these in the summer again 😀</description>

After reading this you may have changed or opinion have it might have strengthened. Some things he says make sense and other comments he makes are very enticing although we need something to back that up. Here is what he say regarding Mike&amp;rsquo;s purchase of Newcastle at the start :</description>

      <description>There is news today that NUSC are planning a protest at the Everton game to signal their intentions once again. It is clear they have wanted Mike Ashley out after Keegan&amp;rsquo;s departure and that is acceptable. However planning a protest at such a time when we are deep in a relegation battle and have got our 1st win in some time is stupid, very idiotic indeed. The players need us more than ever now and especially against Everton, if we win that game it would be a great great win to say the least.</description>

      <description>Injuries are clearing up at Newcastle and this is good news, very good news indeed. With a fully fit squad we can challenge and beat any team bar the top four. Unfortunately our players cannot stay fit and get nasty injuries to keep them out or prolonged spells. Now that we are facing a nervy finale more faces coming back from injury is brilliant news, especially when some of these are quality like Martins and Viduka, when he wants to be.</description>

      <description>Good news on to Toon today as Martins, Viduka and Smith are all in the squad for the away trip to West Brom on Saturday. It is a much needed boost following this January&amp;rsquo;s transfer window and the fact we could&amp;rsquo;ve and should&amp;rsquo;ve signed more players. West Brom as it&amp;rsquo;s known are in a dog fight too and are conveniently placed bottom of the league, The Hawthorn&amp;rsquo;s is not a very easy place to come away with 3 points from as the richest club in the world, City have learnt.</description>

      <description>Kinnear - Missed out on a couple of targets, again Yet again, another window passes by with us capturing next to nothing, numbers wise. Ryan Taylor, Peter Lovenkrands and Kevin Nolan all January signings but we missed out on another couple of targets last night, one of them, Manchester City&amp;rsquo;s Michael Johnston. Conflicting reports are floating around but Joe Kinnear admitted Man City had indeed rejected the bid which is an absolute disgrace on City part, considering we sold them the Premier League&amp;rsquo;s best keeper Shay Given, only the day before.</description>

Taylor come part of a deal which sees N&amp;rsquo;Zogbia o he other way plus we get £6m, thanks very much Bruce 😀 This is not enough though as we need more numbers and we really hope for more faces before 5pm or not too late after that time.</description>

The fee is undisclosed but anything short of £10m would be a disgrace bar £9.75m + a couple of players that is 😀 Shay made over 450 appearances, including 354 Premier League starts, during a distinguished Newcastle career and he has amassed 91 caps for the Republic of Ireland to become the most capped Irish international goalkeeper.</description>

      <description>It all set for action. Shay Given our best keeper, a consistent performer, is undergoing a medical at Manchester City. After Newcastle 1-5 loss at Liverpool Given hasn&amp;rsquo;t been happy since and it seems after a long deliberation that both clubs have agreed a fee, in the region of £8m If the fee is just £8m alone most Toon fans will be raging, including myself. Hopefully though it includes a couple of good players (Elano and Onohua) or else Man City have got an absolute steal for the best keeper in the Premier League.</description>

      <description>Taylor - Set for Newcastle move Unexpectedly Newcastle are moving quickly in the final few days of the window and have completed the signing of Kevin Nolan from Bolton for a fee in the region of £4m. That deal itself took less than 24 hours to complete and may have triggered something in the recruitment team to work even quicker. With N&amp;rsquo;Zogbia leaving Sky Sports have confirmed that Ryan Taylor is heading to Newcastle, and no.</description>

      <description>Nolan - Seems that quick move could happen. I reported earlier that a fee had been agreed for Kevin Nolan between Newcastle and Bolton and it now seems that the deal has taken a step further with Nolan reportedly all set for a medical tomorrow. This would be an unexpected deal, not just the man who is coming but indeed if the deal is this quick, we aren&amp;rsquo;t used to rapid progress at Newcastle.</description>

      <description>Nolan - Toon bound it seems News coming from the North East is suggesting we&amp;rsquo;ve agreed a fee with Bolton for Kevin Nolan, the midfielder that ran the Bolton show for many years up until now. This is good news on some fronts however whether Nolan is willing to come is another matter. The main question is though, how much it is? Is Kevin Nolan past his best? We certainly hope not if he joins us.</description>

Ebondo is still in the works after Toulouse upped their price for him, how long does it take for a deal to be completed at the Toon?! Look at City, ok they have many millions more but it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to sort to de Jong deal, and Ebondo has already said playing for Newcastle would be a &amp;lsquo;dream&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Veloso - Ashley willing to fund his transfer? Miguel Veloso&amp;rsquo;s agent has indicated that Newcastle have made an approach for the versatile player. This news is greeted by Newcastle fans because we all know Veloso is a very good player, many will know him from Football Manager too 😀 Ashley is supposedly 100% behind this transfer and after missing out on Luka Modric Mike said he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to make the same mistake so it seems he is determined to secure this lads signature ahead of Bolton.</description>

      <description>Here we are again, nearing the end of the January transfer window, Kinnear who has named many players as initial targets, have never came but we&amp;rsquo;ve got used to his shady comments and are more concentrated in whom are arriving. With Harper signing a new 3 year deal it could well and more than likely signals the end to one of the best players we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had, Shay Given. It has been a drawn out process of him going here and there but even after Newcastle claiming they have no intention selling today we still can&amp;rsquo;t see us holding on to the Premier League&amp;rsquo;s best keeper.</description>

      <description>Ebondo - Expected in Toon soon Albin Ebondo, Toulouse&amp;rsquo;s right back is expected to be a Magpie no sooner than tomorrow. Kinnear who identified M&amp;rsquo;Bia as a target also suggested that Albin was on their shortlist and that a deal could be in the works. Today Kinnear spoke openly about his attraction towards Ebondo and hinted that he could be a Newcastle player very soon indeed. It would be just what we need too as the transfer window hots up, with Given looking set for City and new rumours suggesting Michael Owen could be soon gone, us Magpies need reinforcements, sooner the better too 🙂</description>

      <description>Given - A great servant to NUFC no matter what happens Well it seems that this has been coming for some time now, the departure of Shay Given, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s and indeed Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s best ever keeper. Season after season he never intended to leave even after near relegation on a number of occasions. Now after a very poor year for Newcastle, it seems Given is set to leave after 11 great years wearing the famous Magpies shirt.</description>

      <description>Lovenkrands - First of more to come we hope Finally we&amp;rsquo;ve signed someone who will play in the first team 😀 Although a long time in the process Peter Lovenkrands has completed his move to Newcastle, signing a contract until the end of the summer, at least. Lovenkrands formerly of Rangers has been a free agent since he left Schalke by mutual consent weeks back. It seems he has been around for ever but he is still only 28 years old and I&amp;rsquo;m sure he has some gas left in that tank of his 😀 What we need is numbers now really and Lovenkrands speed will come in very handy, especially against Sunderland 😀</description>

      <description>When other teams are completing signings for the rest of the season Newcastle are trying to make some progress of their own, with Loïc Remy supposedly in talks with Newcastle United. Remy who can either play on the wing or upfront is with Nice at the minute and his scoring success hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone unnoticed to Dennis Wise and Joe Kinnear. An initial bid of £3m was rejected but talks are on going as the fee could end up at £5m I for one would love to see Remy come to Newcastle as he is a very good forward, conveniently labelled the next Thierry Henry mind you 😉</description>

      <description>Madouni - Possible arrival on Tyneside? Well it seems trials are all style in NUFC as we&amp;rsquo;ve taken yet another player on trial, to judge and perhaps sign up. This time is Madouni an Algerian defender who has played for Bayern and Dortmund, so from that we will take some credit. However the facts are, he is 28 years old, and perhaps past his expiry date. The good ones are that he is very experienced and 6&amp;rsquo;2 😀 This scenario however could mean Kinnear has been given no money or he is trying for Bargain buys, Sebastian Bassong anyone?</description>

Kinnear has said that these will go to the youth squad and not feature for the Seniors however you&amp;rsquo;d find it hard to see this 20 year old settle for the Reserves.</description>

      <description>Well its very hard to be Newcastle supporter during this time, we face uncertainty and the January Transfer window hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone well so far. Peter Lovenkrands and two loan possibilities will play tomorrow in a friendly v Carlisle. If they see Lovenkrands good enough and likewise for the two loan possibilities then we could well have 3 players in on Wednesday. It is exactly what we need, numbers. We&amp;rsquo;ve 11 days break until we play City in Eastlands, a City team that could include Robinho, Kaka, Nigel de Jong and Craig Bellamy.</description>

      <description>Rami - To go on trial with Newcastle? Kinnear has told Sky Sports last night that he is considering upping his bid for Stephane M&amp;rsquo;Bia to nearly £10m and possibly even cancelling the loan deals that may be in the works. We can only assume the loan deals would be cancelled because of the cost of them but one thing is for certain, we need faces and quickly! Another player Kinnear is supposedly after is Lille&amp;rsquo;s Adil Rami, a young Moroccan center back who is quite highly rated in France and it seems he could be making his way to Newcastle on a trial, we certainly hope he can be the next Seb Bassong 😀</description>

      <description>Ashley - Funds needed now as well in summer Blackburn Rovers were victorious today in Ewood Park, a 3-0 defeat may have seemed a one sided game but Toon fans watching the game may differ, I included. The first half alone was ours, we dominated and should&amp;rsquo;ve gone into the break at least one nil up. Butt had an opportunity as did Owen and Carroll (who have his braids in his hair removed :D) however they failed to capitalise.</description>

Oh no, its the story that Joe Kinnear has been offered the Newcastle job on a full time basis.

It is no surprise really that Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s bid for Stephane M&amp;rsquo;Bia has been rejected, it was bound to happen. Kinnear is not giving up though after reportedly going straight back to Rennes with an improved bid, clearly he and the recruitment team aren&amp;rsquo;t wasting any time 😀 We hope that Stephane would be interested and that a price can be agreed between both sides but their president has clearly stated that they have no intention of letting any more player go in January :</description>

      <description>Newcastle United have confirmed through their official website that they no longer have any plans to sign West Ham&amp;rsquo;s Lucas Neill. This is music to some of the Toon fans ears I may add 😛 Neill was confirmed a target today by Kinnear himself claiming he had spoken to Neill&amp;rsquo;s agent and their next move was to West Ham in order to agree a fee. West Ham have been the subject of lots of bids including Craig Bellamy to City on numerous occasions and now they&amp;rsquo;ve resisted a few million for their center back.</description>

      <description>A major flush of stories have come through the press today with Newcastle having confirmed their interest in Stephane M&amp;rsquo;Bia and placing a bid of £5m. It would be hard to believe if this bid is accepted never mind the player wanting to come to St.James&amp;rsquo;. His club, Rennes are 3rd in the French league and questions have been asked whether he would be interested in swapping that for a big club in a competitive relegation battle.</description>

We like the sound of this, especially after tonight&amp;rsquo;s defeat to Hull at home. The game tonight indeed outlined the lack of numbers at Newcastle and it comes as a nice surprise to hear that we&amp;rsquo;ve the bids in.</description>

Whether its a lack of warming up at training or poor pitches we train on nobody knows but what is for certain, we&amp;rsquo;re all sick and tired of the mountain of players on the treatment table. Kinnear called an emergency meeting last night with chairman Derek Llambias and spoke to Mike Ashley over the telephone, Joe who is still most probably waiting on an answer from MA has commented and thrown bait at the subject.</description>

Why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to start Joe Hart is beyond me though 😐 as for Given, a true professional and a great great player to say the least.</description>

Born in Oldham, Driver moved to Scotland and his footballing skills did not go unnoticed as the Jambos signed the young lad up.
Driver is around 5&amp;rsquo;9&amp;amp; in height and can play on the left wing or upfront where he played previously for his club before Hearts.</description>

Tom, who just arrived not so long ago from Ajax in Holland has been dubbed as the next big thing in Holland and his followers including me, still believe that. De Mul hasn&amp;rsquo;t settled at all in Spain and a switch to Newcastle could be just the thing he needs, and Premier Football the sort of football that suits his game.</description>

Reports are already suggesting that Peter Lovenkrands has agreed a move to Newcastle in favour of a dramatic return to his former club, Rangers. It is no secret that Lovenkrands is a decent player and still quite young although he seems to have been around forever :D.</description>

Reports were coming from a major tabloid paper yesterday of this move which sees Alan Smith who is close to full fitness, go the other way. Most Newcastle fans it seems are well an truly delighted to see the back of Alan Smith but not me, I think he has a lot left in his tank yet and never really played as striker which is his natural position.</description>

      <description>Report are mounting and have been within the last number of weeks of Barry Ferguson, Rangers&amp;rsquo; captain could be on the move back to the Premier League, this time to us. Ferguson had a spell at Blackburn in which he failed to impress but his performances in Scotland haven&amp;rsquo;t gone unnoticed, as one man, Joe Kinnear seems keen on him. Ok Ferguson is a decent player but if the reports of him replacing Joey Barton at Newcastle true, it will be a poor acquisition.</description>

      <description>News has just broke of Shay Given being bidded for by money burners City, what a surprise! Their interest has been far from private with a long list of suitors to City&amp;rsquo;s cause and not just in keepers. The bid is meant to be in the region of £8m and personally I believe that is an insult to Newcatsle United and indeed Shay Given himself. If Given is to leave he is surely to go for half of what Buffon would&amp;rsquo;ve of indeed three quarters of his price.</description>

      <description>Kinnear waits on targets We&amp;rsquo;re still unsure whats happening at Newcastle really. Are we pursueing players or are we as Kinnear likes the say &amp;lsquo;banging on doors&amp;rsquo; looking to sell? I hope we&amp;rsquo;re buying players with up recently rumoured to be after Almeria&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Chico&amp;rsquo; a former Barca star. On top of this Geremi said he may leave which is what we don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear because we&amp;rsquo;re so short on numbers mainly.</description>

      <description>We hear of it from tabloids don&amp;rsquo;t we?
Kinnear hasn&amp;rsquo;t been given any money to spend and he&amp;rsquo;s going to lose his job and quess what? We&amp;rsquo;re in a relegation battle although we are 14th?
Don&amp;rsquo;t take heed of the papers, I have no respect for them so I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to name some of them as they&amp;rsquo;d just love the advertisement.
Its a tough one to crack but in the end only Kinnear, Wise and indeed Ashley knows what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Tyne Time!
My name is Kevin Doocey I’m a life long fan of the mighty (sometimes!) Newcastle United, I write occasional opinion pieces on recent events surrounding the brilliant club that is NUFC. It is my aim to bring you a neat and simple interface in which to browse, free from spam, pop-up adverts and other cyberspace annoyances.
Although Newcastle United were relegated in 2009, a gentleman named Chris Hughton took the club right back to the Premier League the very next season, recording an historic 102 points in the process, the most impressive of any team/manager thus far.</description>
