Reports in the Shields Gazette are suggesting that French winger Hatem Ben Arfa who has been strongly linked with a move to Newcastle United - has waved goodbye to his fans at Marseille and his sights are now set on trying the Premier League. Ben Arfa who a couple of days ago came off the bench for Marseille assisted their only goal of the game with a delightful chip beyond  Caen's centre-backs. If he can do some more of that at Newcastle, we should be alright for goals.

Before the game, he clapped to all corners of the stadium Stade VÃ©lodrome basically signalling that he was on his way, be it on loan or permanent. Either that of he just likes clapping. Speaking afterwards, just to confirm that he wanted to leave the club, he said :

> _'The supporters of Marseille have always been behind me and I appreciate them very much â€“ I thank them,'

> _'The Premier League, for me, is one of those elite championships, like Italy, Spain or Germany.'_

That's good to hear, and now I think we're very very close to signing him. Thursday is the supposed day that we'll have him on Tyneside but there could be some last gasp moves from some other Premier League sides too.

I really look forward to having this fella at Newcastle, as he could be the difference of us scoring more goals on our return to the Premier League.
