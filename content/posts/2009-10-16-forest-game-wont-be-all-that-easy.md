###Â Davies - Would love win against Toon

Newcastle will tomorrow attempt to keep their lead in the Coca Cola Championship as we face a trip to Nottingham Forest. Forest themselves who have had a touch a go start to the season aren't doing too badly, lying in about mid-table. For us, we can stay aloft the league and also, hopefully stretch our lead should West Brom, Middlesbrough or Sheffield face a blip in  these weekend games. Chris Hughton, who has been in charge since relegation has done a great job, not least bringing the lads together, both on the field and off, something we haven't had in a while.

However, some people think tomorrows game will be a walkover and an easy Toon win. I personally, would be very surprised if this was the case and to be honest, I think Forest could get something out of the game if they play their cards right.

Obviously we hope Newcastle triumph, and some goals are scored but there's no guarantee. Nottingham Forest are no pushers, on home soil at least. On the other hand it's good to get these games over, because come May, when we might be near promotion, Forest could well prove to be a stumbling block, especially if history is anything to go by.

An early goal and one before half time would be very nice indeed, and Jonas to score both. Perhaps I'm getting just a little carried away?:D

**Tyne Time's Prediction**: Nottingham Forest 1-2 Newcastle United
