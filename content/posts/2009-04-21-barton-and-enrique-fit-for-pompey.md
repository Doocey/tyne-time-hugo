###Â Enrique - Good to have him back

On Monday we'll be facing Portsmouth in a must win game. That game could decide out fate this season and most people know this. The good news today is that Jose Enrique and the famous Joey Barton will be returning for that Monday evening. Barton has been missed in midfield without a doubt as we lack so much creativity, Joey isn't a Ronaldinho, Deco or Riquelme but he can pass and will hopefully provide something from our front 2/3. indeed that is a major question, whether Shearer will play 3 upfront or leave it until a later stage in the game.

I think playing 3 upfront would be a good idea as we have nothing to lose and everything to gain, although that may sound wrong, we need to be trying everything we can to save our season. Barton's arrival will no doubt put a bite back into midfield but whether he'll start or not is another thing. We hope he does, and doesn't get injured/sent off. We need calm heads, approaching the deadline of this Premier League campaign. What a PL campaign it has been, so many up's and downs for us. We hope to end on a high and certainly remain in teh Premier League, where we belong.
