### Hughton - Could manage all three points today if he plays his cards right

It's funny to see the media already dishing Newcastle after a 'shocking' loss to Blackpool last weekend. There wasn't anything shocking about it really, apart from the fact Blackpool had a great keeper on the day, and two guys who could finish their chances. So far we've two losses, a draw and a win. For a newly promoted side, having to play Manchester United, Aston Villa , Wolves and Blackpool, that's not a bad showing at all. I think it's fair to say we did expectÂ somethingÂ from the 'Pool match but it was one of those games that we just didn't have Lady Luck on our side. Today however, is a different story altogether.

Today we will take on Everton, at Goodison Park and as much as our chances have been dished - I think we might nab a point or even more. Everton themselves started the season terribly, but instilled some new born confidence with two goals in the last minute to draw 3-3 with Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United.

On the other hand, we're coming off a supposedly 'shock' defeat to another newly promoted side at home - it makes simple math to calculate what will happen today at Goodison Park. I don't think that's the case, the last time was just the sameÂ scenario, with Joe Kinnear in charge. We we're 2-0 down, and in the second half, we managed to pull things off, with Damien Duff & Steven Taylor grabbing the goals.

Today we've Chris Hughton in charge, and big Andy Carroll, Hatem Ben Arfa, to guide us to some points. It's a changed team for sure, but changed for the better. If we can keep to our game today, then I really do fancy our chances here. If Williamson can keep close to Cahill and be physical with him, like Vidic was last week, I think we might calm one of their biggest forces.

Anyway, only time will tell what exactly will happen, but it's on a 3PM today, so make sure you stay tuned!
