### Pierce - Moving the sale along we hope

Now it seems the sale of Newcastle United will be delayed even longer because Mike Ashley has locked himself in the 'data' room, well not really but it seems that there is yet another  'slight' delay in the sale of NUFC. Apparently there are two consortia interested with both expressing their interest. Also, both groups have shown Derek Llambias, Mike Ashley and Seymour Pierce proof of their funds. When Ashley was trying to sell Newcastle last year he said he'd only settle for the buyer with the best intent at heart. It seems that has gone out the window and maybe just as well because Mike will be lucky if we're sold before the season starts.

Alan Shearer is still waiting to hear about where he may come out in this scenario and hopefully it'll be as manager. Alan is very keen on the job and wants to be appointed ASAP. He's not the only ones who wants him as manager very quickly, the fans are desperate for his signature and indeed the players are intent on having him back. If we're to have any chance of keeping our decent players likes Sebastien Bassong then Â Shearer has to be in charge. I'm not too sure Bassong, Oba, Taylor etc will be too enthusiastic about having Chris Hughton as boss.
