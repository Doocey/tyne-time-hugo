With Newcastle not playing until Monday, West Brom today had the chance to return to the top of the Coca Cola Championship table and that they did, comprehensively. A four one thrashing at home to Bristol City clearly shortened the odds for West Brom's promotion but we're still only in an early stage of the season, with di Matteo reiterating that. On Monday we'll go to  Preston which I believe is live on Sky Sports and hopefully we'll be back on top of the table come 10pm.

Speaking after the victory, Roberto said :

> 'You can't be higher than top so after 17 games we can be pleased. But we will not be getting complacent.

Indeed he's very right, and of course we'd love to see our very own Newcastle United win the Coca Cola Championship in their very first year but that will be quite a difficult task, as much as some people will try to argue.

We still haven't a proper squad, we need new players and hopefully January will see that happen. Although we all very much doubt Mike Ashley will give Chris any cash worthwhile, there is hope for some impressive loan signings withÂ Per Ciljan Skjelbred already rumoured to be lined up in January.

If we can a few new players and get the current ones we have to play at full potential then we surely cannot be far off come May. Then again, wasn't that said at the start of the year?
