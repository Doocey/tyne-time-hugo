## Peter - Toon's first new signing

News has broke and it is no surprise really that Peter LÃ¸venkrands is all set to be Newcastle's first signing of the January transfer market. After leaving Schalke by mutual consent the Toon were linked with him straight away but it seemed Rangers were keen too. Joe has said that Peter has looked good in training and that he is more than happy to play with us until the end of the season, at least. Just what we like to hear ðŸ™‚

Joe said :

'We've got an opportunity to bring him on a free transfer and I will make a decision this week.

'He's got a terrific track record of scoring goals and has got massive experience.

'The deal would be until the end of the season to help us out in this injury crisis.

'I did my homework and have kept in contact with his agent.

'When I got the news he had bought himself out of his contract I got in straight away.

'His wife has gone back to Scotland to have their second child so it might work out well for all of us.'

We certainly hope so as want away Charles N'Zogbia has yet again spoken to the media about his future laying away from St.James', what's new? So if Lovenkrands does sign it will be a decent free, rumours also have it that Stephen Appiah is one his way to Newcastle but it's from another tabloid, surprise surprise.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
