## Lovenkrands - First of more to come we hope

Finally we've signed someone who will play in the first team ðŸ˜€ Although a long time in the process Peter Lovenkrands has completed his move to Newcastle, signing a contract until the end of the summer, at least. Lovenkrands formerly of Rangers has been a free agent since he left Schalke by mutual consent weeks back. It seems he has been around for ever but he is still only 28 years old and I'm sure he has some gas left in that tank of his ðŸ˜€ What we need is numbers now really and Lovenkrands speed will come in very handy, especially against Sunderland ðŸ˜€

In other news Joe has confirmed he is in the market for a defender and it is believed that the trialists may have done enough to secure a fulltime signature at Newcastle. Joe Mattock is a name being tossed around as well and he could certainly be a good acquisition. More news will follow and we certainly hope more players follow Peter Lovenkrands to Tyneside
