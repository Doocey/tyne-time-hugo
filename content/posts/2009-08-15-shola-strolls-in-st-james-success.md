###Â Ameobi - Sublime three goals today

In a game which saw potential Newcastle United owner Barry Moat sit inbetween the current hierarchy at Newcastle of Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias, Newcastle produced a performance to remember and one needed to boost  all sides morale. Newcastle started the game brightly creating chances and were comfortably controlling the game. Jonas was presented with a great opportunity after a Kevin Nolan through ball but the Argentine per usual, stumbled and didn't show an end product. However some time late Jonas again involved laid it off to JosÃ© Enrique who put a great ball in for Ameobi and the Newcastle number 23 headed down into the ground, the ball ended up looping over Reading's despairing keeper.

Newcastle made it two with the most memorable goal of the game, Kevin Nolan chasing down a lost cause , played it to Ryan Taylor who sent in a glorious ball for Ameobi, who had his work cut-out but headed across the face of the goal and in. It was a great team goal and took the edge off the game. The Toon fans were clearly delighted and Mike Ashley too, rising from his seat in jubilation for the second time. Barry Moat was clearly delighted too and when Ameobi slotted home his hattrick and Newcastle's third, the whistle sounded shortly after and Barry Moat, shook hands with Mike Ashley and Derek Llambias perhaps indicating the first of hopefully many more handshakes.

With Shearer's name being pounded around the stadium it was obvious who the St.James' faithful clearly wanted. Fortunately for Mike Ashley the booing was to a minimal and the game clearly taken over by what was a great performance to say the least.

Kevin Nolan and Shola Ameobi both match contenders for MOM but it was Shola and his three goals that saw him take home the match ball. A lot of credit is due to Chris Hughton and the shape he has the squad in, a little anxiety when Joey Barton went off with a foot injury, the same one bothering him at Man City last year.Â  Surely this victory, a convincing one for Barry Moat and co.? We'd certainly hope so.
