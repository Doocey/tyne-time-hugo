## StÃ©phane M'Bia - One bid in for him

The latest news coming from Kinnear is that **Ashley has given funds** to him after the emergency meeting and that Kinnear and the team have two serious bids in for players. We like the sound of this, especially after tonight's defeat to Hull at home. The game tonight indeed outlined the lack of numbers at Newcastle and it comes as a nice surprise to hear that we've the bids in. StÃ©phane M'Bia will not come for Â£4m though as the recruitment team may think, if he does however it would be a steal. Everton again have been long admirers of him. Kinnear did not exactly say that M'Bia was his target but his interview with Sky Sports may indicate this, just a little bit ðŸ˜€

Joe said:

_'We've made two serious Â£4million bids for two players and we'll probably end up spending Â£10million,' said Kinnear.

'We're waiting to hear on them.'

'He's from Cameroon, is a 6ft 2in midfielder and we're waiting to hear back from his club.'_

The most important fact is that Kinnear **has been given funds by Mike Ashley** after a long deliberation. More to report on tomorrow as the targets and rumours just keep coming.

Comments appreciated Â ðŸ˜€
