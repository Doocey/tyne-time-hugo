### Scharner - Good enough for Newcastle?

There are stories today originating from a less than credible newspaper today, that Newcastle are keeping tabs on Paul Scharner, the Wigan midfielder. I'm suspecting these reports are utter nonsense but never the less I'll report on them, considering it involved NUFC. Perhaps the connection between Scharner and Newcastle is the fact he indeed scored the goal to keep Wigan in the Premier League those years ago. In my opinion, he wouldn't be good enough for Newcastle but the same was said about Peter Lovenkrands. Scharner is quite old too and our Premier League status isn't guaranteed as of yet.

Scharner isn't much of a goal scorer either with only 10 goals for Wigan in total, out of 100 odd appearances. We shouldn't be looking at potential transfer targets either until we are officially safe because there is still the possibility that we could go down yet. I certainly hope it won't and another win at home to Fulham will save our season. We can't see Boro and Hull winning two games back to back never mind West Brom winning two in succession. A win at Fulham and maybe a point at Villa. That's what we've aimed for since February and hopefully we'll get it.
