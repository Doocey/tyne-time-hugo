### Nolan - Deservedly sent off for an awful challenge

On a day where the theme was of rivalry although not normally, tackles flew in, from Newcastle players to say the least. The above picture shows Nolan's tackle on Anichebe which rightly got him sent off after 44 minutes at St.James'. A terrible challenge from a player who is very important to Newcastle's survival this year. Unfortunately now, that will mean Nolan will miss three important games upcoming.

The visitors were by far the sharper team during the early encounters and had two glorious opportunities to take a lead which would have been well deserved. Harper managed to block Jack Rodwell's 29th-minute effort at the far post with his legs as Everton threatened. Ryan Taylor curled a free-kick just over five minutes later as we started to dominate, but it was then that Nolan's adrenalinÂ  got the better of him and with Marouane Fellaini replacing Anichebe, we came under attack again.

However after Martins made an introduction and Jonas alike Newcastle could've well taken the lead if Jonas had only his shooting boots on. (No emphasis on the article below :P) After that we didn't attack though a settled for a point which now takes us 5 points clear of the danger zone. Our next game holds the same importance yet again and 3 points at Bolton would be great ðŸ˜€
