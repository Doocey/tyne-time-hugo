### Enrique - Would consider a bigger offer

Jose Enrique has today announced that he will play for Newcastle in the Championship. Speaking today to Marca , a Spanish newspaper he said he's very happy at Newcastle United and love the town and the fans. However he didn't rule out the possibility of  leaving Newcastle should a better offer be accepted by the. Speaking today he said every player wants to play in the English Premier League and he is one of them. Enrique who has a turbulent start to his Newcastle career has just settled of late and is turning out to be a fine player indeed.

Enrique said :
  > “I have a contract for three years with Newcastle,” ”Nobody wants to play in the Championship, but I’m thinking only of fulfilling my contract.”
  “The team has great resources and I am sure that if things go well from the start we can be a team to match Aston Villa.”
  “I like the city and I am very happy in England, but that does not stop anyone considering an offer that might arrive from another team.”
  > “As it stands today, I see myself playing next season at Newcastle."

We can't blame the lad for leaving if he is to, but he must respect that Newcastle stuck with him, even through his bad times. As he said
'As it stands today, I see myself playing next season at Newcastle.'

We certainly hope he will be playing for Newcastle this forthcoming season.

Comments appreciated 🙂
