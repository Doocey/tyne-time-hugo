### Edmundsson - Signs on loan from B68 Toftir for the remainder of the season

I must say the Sunday Papers have been pretty quiet today, it seems as if they're all too caught up in the John Terry scandal to produce any 'interesting' rumours surrounding us Magpies. Newcastle in the last couple of days have reportedly signed Joan Simun Edmundsson from B68 Toftir on-loan for the rest of the season. We don't know a huge amount about the Faroe Island  international but in case you didn't know, he's the guy on the right of the picture ðŸ˜€ Brian Kerr, current Faroe Islands and former Ireland manager has backed the 18-year old to make an impact on Tyneside as Kerr himself saw what the youngster can do, playing for the Faroe Islands in their recent game against France. It's good to see we are still signing young blood but this could mean a lot more than at first sight.

When Mike Ashley arrived he set about 'trying' to make a team and build a future generation of potential worldbeaters. In what has been about his only success at the club, we've seen the likes of Nile Ranger, Haris Vuckic and others come through the ranks.

During the turmoil at the club Â we didn't sign anyone and our youth development stalled fully when Dennis Wise departed the club. Some time on, here we are keeping tabs on a potential gem in the name of Joan Simun Edmundsson.

Many are saying that this means that Mike Ashley won't be selling anytime soon and normality has resumed at the club, ie buying a 'few' youngins'. However, to say Newcastle United fans would be a tad disappointed if Mike Ashley was our owner come May is an understatement.

The club has picked up both on and off the field but Mike Ashley is still no football club owner. Some says he's learning and I'd certainly hope so but surely he cannot stay another season on Tyneside if we manage to get promoted and he has a few offers for the club?

Edmundsson is 18 and won't be going into the U-18 Newcastle United side. Instead, we'd expect the lad to be on the bench in the senior team in a few weeks, once he's settled in on Tyneside. It will be interesting to see how he fares and who knows, we might just have the next SÃºni Olsen on our hands. Who? A very good question ðŸ˜€
