### Edward Ofere linked again with Newcastle

It's being reported tonight that Mike Williamson has signed finally, for Newcastle United. The Portsmouth CB has supposedly signed on a 3-year deal for a fee of Â£1.2m. As well as this, according to Sky Sports, we could well make a move for Malmo's Edward Ofere. As we [reported](https://www.tynetime.com/2009/10/09/toon-readying-ofere-for-nigerian/ "reported") in October of last year, Chris Hughton could well have the tall striker on his shortlist, and a list that's  getting shorter every day too I'm sure. Ofere is a Nigerian and quite a tall lad. He's currently plying his trade in Sweden with Malmo FC but their president today said that they're pretty much open to offers for him.

Speaking today, a member of the boards said :

> _'If Newcastle are interested in Ofere then it's just for them to contact us but they need to hurry up as the transfer window closes soon,'_
>
> _'Of course we have a plan if Ofere would leave. We need to have.'_

We think that Malmo are looking to seal a transfer for him and get some money in what are difficult times. However, it's obvious that Newcastle have been in contact with them for Ofere, or are certainly snipping around.

I can't say I've seen much of Edward Ofere play but if he's anything like the last Nigerian we had then I think he could do a job for Newcastle United FC.

With Harewood ruled out with a broken metatarsal it rules him out of a move to Newcastle on loan and I think this was Chris Hughton's Plan A. Today he admitted that it was a blow to his plans. He did also say he;d look elsewhere and I'm sure the rumours will start to mount.
