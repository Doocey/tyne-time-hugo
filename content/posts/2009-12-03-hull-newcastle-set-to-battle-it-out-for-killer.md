###Â Kilgallon - Hull have moved in alongside Newcastle for the CB

Well it seems my latest article caused quite a lot of controversy and perhaps it was just a little too harsh on Birmingham City. They're doing well in the Premier League and Toon old boys Stephen Carr & Lee Bowyer seem to be enjoying their football at St.Andrews. Long may it last but I still believe that they'll be fighting it out for survival come April/ May, then again, that's only my  opinion. Anyway, today's brings news that Matthew Kilgallon is now being looked at by Phil Brown. Hull City, who have enjoyed quite a positive spell of late seem to have belief that they can win games and put it up against anyone, even in the transfer market.

Hull's offer will probably be more substantial that Newcastle's and it's being rumoured that Peter Halmosi could also be offered as part of the deal. If the offer is accepted then it will be hard to 'The Killer' to turn down a move to the Premier League.

Needless to say, he could also have the choice to join Newcastle and hope for promotion and indeed take it from there but no one but Matt himself knows what he'll decide.

If I'm to be honest I think that Hull should be aiming a little higher, no offence to Kilgallon, he's more than decent, but are these the players you'd be looking to sign in January to fight it out at the foot of the table?

Either way I'm sure Chris Hughton will make another approach for the defender, or perhaps even wait till he's out of contract in the Summer. I can imagine that Sheffield are keen to get a reasonable fee for their prized asset before he walks on a free.
