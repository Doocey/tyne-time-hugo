### Sheard - Supposedly watched the Palace game

Things are never dull at Newcastle, not for one minute. All of a sudden we're being taken over, then we have a deadline set, and then the deadline delayed. The latest gust of news/rumours/(made up nonsense), is that  Newcastle United have a new bidder. In the Chronicle in the last few minutes, Lee Ryder has posted up a ground breaking (well not really) story, that Geoff Sheard is making a bid for the Magpies. Sheard, who will be mainly known for his failed takeover at Sheffield Wednesday, is apparently interested in taking the troubled club off a fellow sportswear tycoon, Mike Ashley.

Speaking today, Llambias said :

> 'Geoff is dealing with Keith Harris and we are still waiting for proof of funds.'

Whether Derek is telling the truth is another matter, considering he is contradicting himself on earlier statements. He claimed that Moat was the only bidder.On Sheard's side, a source also spoke to the popular Chronicle.

A Source said :

> 'He’s keen to run a football club.
>
> 'It didn’t work out when he tried to take over Sheffield Wednesday but feels he has something to offer Newcastle.
>
> 'He’s got serious backing and is in negotiations with Seymour Pierce.'

In all honesty, the only thing that this will do is hold up the process even more, and may hinder Barry Moat's chances of taking over, even more. We'll just have to wait and see (again), but the chance of new players coming in to Newcastle is looking very, very unlikely now.

Comments welcome
