###Â Hughton - Working under severe Ashley demands

Speaking today to local papers today, Chris Hughton, who is doing a really good job with the lads this season, revealed who he tried for during the transfer window period. Although the window has slammed shut, and slammed firmly shut for Chelsea, Championship squads can continue to loan and sign free agents. We're currently  top of the table, the last we said that was on the first day of the season with Sam Allardyce in charge, after a 3-1 victory at Bolton. Notably the scorers in that game are now departed and Bolton's scorer Kevin Nolan, is currently a Magpie. Just thought I'd point that out ðŸ˜€

On Harewood, Hughton commented :

> 'Marlon was one of the numerous names we looked at,' 'We were unable to do business.

Harewood, would be a good signing for Newcastle and indeed Hughton as we lack that type of player up front at the minute.

Hughton also confirmed his interest in Craig Cathcart but said they were unable to arrange a deal, during the transfer window at least.

> 'He was a player that was on our minds.
>
> 'Unfortunately we were unable to do business. And no agreement has been made.'

However, all is not gloom and doom at Newcastle, actually, far from it. Top of the Championship table, a takeover still on the cards, highest earners off the wage bill (some) and new arrivals still a very real prospect. Now, how many Toon fans would've taken that scenario at the start of August?

> 'We know where we are when it comes to the areas we are short of.
>
> 'There isn't anybody we can rule in at this stage, but certainly we have some big decisions to make.
>
> 'In five days' time we hope to bring in loan signings. These will be initial one-month loan deals that could be extended to three months.'

So there it is, keep the faith and we might be pleasantly surprised. What we do know is that Hughton is still working to targets and also that our chief scoutÂ Lil Fuccillo has departed from the club, joining Swansea. Until tomorrow.

Comments welcome
