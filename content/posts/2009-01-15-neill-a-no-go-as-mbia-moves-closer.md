Newcastle United have confirmed through their official website that they no longer have any plans to sign West Ham's Lucas Neill. This is music to some of the Toon fans ears I may add ðŸ˜› Neill was confirmed a target today by Kinnear himself claiming he had spoken to Neill's agent and their next move was to West Ham in order to agree a fee. West Ham have been the subject of lots of bids including Craig Bellamy to City on numerous occasions and now they've resisted a few million for their center back. We aren't hurt by this and respect West Ham's decision, quite surprising for a club in a financial crisis to reject any decent bids though.

Kinnear who doesn't believe in secrecy when it comes to transfer targets has confirmed that a Â£5m offer has been made for Stephane M'Bia and Kinnear sounded confident, as if some progress has been made already ðŸ˜€ We certainly hope so as M'Bia would be a fine acquisition for our midfield. On the other hand a source close to the board has revealed that Barton could be on his way out, we hope that's a load of nonsense though because Barton is just the player we need in a competitive relegation battle like this. We've already rejected a couple of bids for him and we hope for no more, with Bolton already giving up on Joey. Â£5m for M'Bia would be a steal but should he move the fee would surely in the region of Â£8 - 10m, perhaps this is a perfect example of the 'right' player Mike Ashley is willing to splash his cash on ðŸ™‚

Comments appreciated
