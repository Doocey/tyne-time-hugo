### Kilgallon - Moving clubs in January if he can

Sheffield United boss Kevin Blackwell has confirmed today that his prominent centre-back Matthew Kilgallon, will leave the club in the January transfer period. Kilgallon, who is highly rated in both the Championship & the Premier League will look for a new club after no agreement could be made on a new deal at Bramall Lane. Chris Hughton earlier this year expressed an interest  in the former Leeds CB, but the likes of Hull City have also been linked to making an offer for the lad.

Speaking today, Blackwell said :

> 'It is a fait accompli that 'Killa' will be going,'
>
> 'He spoke to (chief executive) Trevor Birch, but we can't reach an agreement.
>
> 'At the moment, this club is not in a position to offer outrageous terms to anyone. We can't afford to pay the terms we used to.'

We must ask the question was Kilgallon asking for massive wages or simply pricing himself out of a stay at Sheffield. As I've said before, and will say again, the last thing we need are more overpaid players who are getting the rough side of 25.

Saying that, if Chris does indeed make an offer and has it accepted, I wouldn't mind seeing Kilgallon arriving, although I'm sure Hull & The Premier League (Wages) might appeal just a little more to him.

Either way, we do need new faces but whether Kilgallon will be one of them, we'll just have to see.
