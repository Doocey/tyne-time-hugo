### Bassong - Attracting apparent interest from Arsenal

Sebastien Bassong has spoken today about rumours linking him with Arsenal and despite the crappy tabloids claiming he's all ready to join Arsenal in the summer is nonsense, let's just get that straight first. He did however confirm his agent approached him about some interest from Arsenal however Arsené Wenger hasn't said a word about it. We all know Bassong by now, the best Newcastle defender all season and it doesn't surprise anyone that he could be attracting interest from bigger clubs. Sebastien said today though, that the only thing on his mind now is keeping Newcastle up and let's hope he does because you would certainly expect him to leave should we go down 🙁

Bassong said today :

_“Newcastle want to make me sign a contract extension, indeed. I’m waiting to see what they’re going to offer me.”</p>

“My agent quickly told me about Arsenal’s interest. But it’s not the moment to speak about it. I must be focused on my football and on the end of the season, we will see what happens then.”

“At the moment I’m 100 percent focused on Newcastle and I don’t see any reason why this would change.”

“But I would lie if I said that Arsenal are not a club I’m interested in. But many things can happen before we can speak about a transfer."_

Mixed messages there but one clear one, Bassong is keen to stay and keep us up and hopefully sign a new contract at the end of the season 🙂

Comments appreciated  🙂
