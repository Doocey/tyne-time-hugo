### Seasons Greetings to all you readers

As you know it's Christmas Eve and tomorrow is Christmas day. Tyne Time would like to wish all it's readers and every Geordie in the world, from Brazil to Australia, a very very Happy Christmas. I'm sure a lot of things have happened since the last time Christmas was celebrated, some good, some bad. However, for Newcastle United, things have marginally picked up. 10 points clear  at the top of the Coca Cola Championship and stability at once is seems. This 'blog in particular has covered stories about Newcastle United ranging from the club being bought by a person who doesn't exist, to their Managing Director running across a football pitch naked, although we didn't cover that story in detail, if you know what I mean.

**Time Time** stared in the early months of 2009 and with continued support from a buzzing Newcastle United fan base, I'm glad to say that it's making progress every day.

I personally try to give you an in-depth look with no nonsense headlines, into the goings on at our beloved club. Sometimes it's a lot harder that it sounds believe me!

As we enter 2010 in the next week, we'd just like to wish all of you a very very, merry Christmas and indeed the best of luck in the New Year. Also, let's hope the lads keep up their good form with a win against Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day.

Howay The Lads!

Doocey.
