### Ashley - What a mess he's made

Today Mike Ashley publicly apologized to the Newcastle faithful, staff and anyone merely associated with NUFC. IN a statement he continued to say how sorry he was and that it was his fault such a  catastrophe occurred, Newcastle's relegation. Most people won't accept this apology as actions speak louder than words however Shearer and Mr.Ashley were locked in a lengthy meeting today over Big Al's future and indeed the plan for the football club in Championship football.

Rumours are suggesting Ashley is ready to sell up but the most likely option is, that he's wants Shearer as full time manager and they are planning in detail the next steps of the mighty football club. Speaking today Ashley said :

> SEEING Newcastle United relegated from the Premier League has been a catastrophe for us all.
>
> I fully accept that mistakes were made during this and previous seasons and I am very sorry for that.
>
> I would like to say sorry to our magnificent supporters who have turned up in their thousands, home and away, up and down the country and who have given the team amazing backing throughout.
>
> And I would also say sorry to all of the Club's hard-working staff, who have gone about their jobs all year long.
>
> Bringing Alan Shearer back to Newcastle United was the best decision I have made. Alan and his staff did all they could to try and keep us up in the short space of time they had.

> Talks are now ongoing between us about how we can take this Club forward again.

Mistakes have been made for sure, and the biggest mistake of all some say was letting Ashley take over. What do you think is in store for NUFC? Nothing can surprise us now, we've seen it all, right?
