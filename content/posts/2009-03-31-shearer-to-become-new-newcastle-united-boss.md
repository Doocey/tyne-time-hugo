### Shearer - Widely reported to be taking control of Newcastle

It's an April fool , I'm loving it for one. Alan Shearer is becoming the Newcastle boss for the rest of the season. It has been widely reported on Sky Sports News, with North East correspondent David Craig issuing the news first. He himself has said it would be highly unlikely but what a prospect it is for Shearer to become the Newcastle boss!

It certainly seems so, with Planetfootball covering this story now! This is an excellent move by the Newcastle board in my opinion and gives us a boosted chance of staying up! Now a confirmed story all questions have been answered and surely this is well received amongst Newcastle fans across England and indeed the world? 8 games left and a man in charge that can certainly turn things around, maybe he'll even come out of retirement and play ðŸ˜€ It's a good piece of business by Mike Ashley as lets hope we stay up, with the old legend keeping us afloat.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
