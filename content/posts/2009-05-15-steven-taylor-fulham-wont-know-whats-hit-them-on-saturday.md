### Pantsil - Will be a tough wall to overcome tomorrow

On Saturday around 6.50 pm we'll know whether Newcastle are destined for Premier League safety.A team who themselves were in a worse position than Newcastle are now, managed to overcome the drop and return for their strongest Premier League campaign in some time. Hitting 50 points in the league is a brilliant achievement and credit is due to Roy Hodgson and his players for turning it around at Craven Cottage. Indeed it has been their home form that the great form has developed through with a great amount of wins coming from Craven Cottage itself.

The Cottagers haven't the greatest away record and Steven Taylor is fully aware of this as I'm sure Shearer is too. Speaking today, the local lad, Steven Taylor said that Fulham won't like to play at St.James' if the atmosphere is the same it was last Monday night.

> “For teams coming here, I know they won’t like it.
>
> “That was the best atmosphere I have ever played in, and my best night in football.
>
> “They were so noisy and they didn’t shut up at any stage.
>
> “As players it gives us a lift. When I scored it made me feel three foot taller, that’s what an impact this crowd have.
>
> “Fulham have to come here, and with the fans we have, it will be difficult for them.
>
> “If the fans are as good as they were against Boro, then we’ll have no problem at all.”

It's clear that the victory has cheered the players up and Taylor is pretty certain they can replicate another performance worthy of 3 points come Saturday.

> “It was a massive boost for the lads to get out of the bottom three.
>
> “Everybody came back in the dressing room after it and the smiles were back on the faces.
>
> “We now look forward to Fulham.
>
> “There’s no reason why we can’t get more next week.
>
> “Look at our team performance against Boro – there were quality performances all the way through.”

That's it, Fulham tomorrow, 3 points against them and if Hull lose to Bolton we can call ourselves safe, although, how many times have the shots been called far too early this season?

Comments appreciated 🙂
