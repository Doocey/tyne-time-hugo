### Lovenkrands - Scoring a fair few goals for the Toon and long may it continue

As I said a yesterday Newcastle United were in rich scoring form at home, and had accumulated 9 goals in their last 2 games on Tyneside. Using my fantastic mathematical brain(!) I've calculated that, the average amount of goals scored in our last two encounters is 4.5, with Wayne Routledge's goal counting as the extra half :D. It doesn't take a genius to see that we are pelting them in at  home of late and against decent sides, Cardiff City andÂ indeed Coventry City. However, I'm sure you've all noticed that we are failing to score freely away from home, if even scoring at all.

In fact, we've only scored one in our last 3 games away from home, at Leicester City, Derby County and indeed Swansea City. All decent sides mind you but still, there's Â huge difference between our scoring form at home and away. Although you'd expect that, not to the extent that's occurring.

There's no point looking at in serious detail though because it doesn't mean a whole lot as such, but we really would look to see the lads score more away from home and to start winning away from home again.

As we saw with Stoke City last season and this season, home form is essential to any successful season. Stoke have the most unattractive style of football anyone could for yet they're grinding out results thanks to a pressurizing crowd, long-throws and a tight back line which includes former Newcastle defender Abdoulaye Faye.

If we can keep our great home form going throughout the remainder of the season then we'll be doing very well. If we can beat Nottingham Forest at St.James' in a game that **Tyne Time** may well be attending although we're being made wait until the 1st of March to order the tickets online. (If anyone feels they can help then do contact us) ðŸ˜€ then we'll have done brilliantly.

With Brom, Cardiff, Swansea, and Middlesbrough all played at home and many of them already played twice for the season then surely we can win this league outright. I've put my confidence in the lads and I think they'll duly deliver.

(One they pick up their away form) ðŸ˜€
