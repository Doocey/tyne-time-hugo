The new kit for Newcastle's 09/10 campaign has been released today. It's very similar to last years with minor change. The Adidas logo is now embroidered on the black stripe rather than the white of this years. It's good to see we'll be still sponsored by Adidas even if we do get relegated. The goalkeepers kit isn't too bad and is an improvement on the current bright yellow one. We hope that we'll be playing in this jersey in the Premier League again.
