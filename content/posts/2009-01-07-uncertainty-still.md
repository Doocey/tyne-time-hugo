## Kinnear waits on targets

We're still unsure whats happening at Newcastle really. Are we pursueing players or are we as Kinnear likes the say 'banging on doors' looking to sell? I hope we're buying players with up recently rumoured to be after Almeria's 'Chico' a former Barca star. On top of this Geremi said he may leave which is what we don't want to hear because we're so short on numbers mainly. We will hopefully get 3 or 4 in with Ashley hoping to be forgiven by the Newcastle fans. 3 or 4 good players will whet the appetite nicely! ðŸ™‚ there's also news of Wise being removed from his position too. Never mind the positions in the board, lets sort the positions on the field. Hopefully i'll have something exciting to report on next.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
