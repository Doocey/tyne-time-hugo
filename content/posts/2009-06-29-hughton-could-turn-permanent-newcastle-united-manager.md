### Hughton - Could be made permanent should Ashley's regime continue

As the confusion continues and there's still no worthwhile communication it seems that Chris Hughton as scary as this may sound, is  favorite to come Newcastle's permanent manager, yes permanent, not interim. The first real bit of action from Newcastle (or someone) was to re appoint Chris Hughton to first team duties and get them organised for their pre-season, staring in Ireland. They'll be taking on Shamrock Rovers in Tallagh Dublin and who knows who'll be starting? Will Michael Owen start up front? Will Coloccini start at center? Will Bassong be in the first 11?

I think it'll probably be the youth team on show, the likes of Ranger, Vuckic, Godsmark, Marwood etc. That aside we certainly hope that Hughton does not become full time boss and that Shearer will be in , in time for the upcoming friendlies and indeed leading the preparation before the new Championship campaign. The silence is deafening at the minute and we really need this mess sorted. How many times have I said that though? And any developments since?..

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
