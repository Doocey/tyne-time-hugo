### Jonas - Should be back just in time for the Argentina - Mexico Last 16 encounter

The FIFA World Cup in South Africa is shaping up nicely with England just about managing to qualify and setup an exciting tie against Germany. Many people have tipped England to win the World Cup, but I can't honestly see this happening. Instead on reporting on every little trace of a rumour that blows around Tyneside, we here at Tyne Time thought we'd take a look  at the World Cup and see how our own very Jonas Gutierrez is getting on. So far, in what's been an on and off tournament, we've managed to make quite a few bob on the World Cup and that's always a good thing. However, some Three Lions fans seem a bit sick up of the competition so far and have gone as far as emailing Tyne Time of their boredom!

Now is probably the best time to get your bets on, and bettingexpert.com, as we've said many a time now, are one of the leading sites in finding you the best value bets and indeed sign-up offers.

Probably the best offer going right now is at Betfair where they'll refund any losing first bets with cash, inevitably meaning - you're first bet is risk free! Betfair offer up to 20% better odds on most football matches so you'll be getting more dosh with these then you would from the local bookie down the road.

If you're like some of those fans who are failing to get excited by the World Cup, perhaps you'd prefer some fun with the slots. Big money can be won from small stakes and again, Betting Expert will help you with finding the best offers.

A little advice from Tyne Time is to indeed gamble carefully and should you need any assistance about a potential problem, don't hesitate in going over toÂ Gamble Aware.

And one last thing, we wouldn't advise any bets on Jonas Gutierrez claiming the Golden Boot or Player of the Tournament accolade. Look elsewhere ðŸ˜€
