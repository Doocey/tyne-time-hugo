### Carroll - Could be given a start tomorrow

After signing a new deal not so long ago, local lad Andy Carroll has expressed his determination to do well for Newcastle and keep them up with goals. Although he hasn't started a huge chunk of the season he's got a couple of goals to show, including a great header against West Ham and a tap in v the richest team in the world, Manchester City. Shearer paid a visit to one of the reserve games and said he was impressed by Andy's performance, granting it an excellent one. Who will start up front tomorrow is still unknown but most of us think Big Andy is in with a big shout.

Shearer said :

> 'I asked Andy to go out and show me what he could do, and he did that,' said Shearer.
> 'Like all of the lads who came from the first team, he showed a great appetite and a great attitude.'

We wouldn't mind seeing a 6 foot striker start alongside Martins or Owen or indeed all three strikers starting with Michael Owen playing the pocket behind the front two. Â With the 3 injuries Shearer may well be forced to implement an attacking style but the starting line up is still unknown. Who ever starts we want 100% from and really hope they come home with all 3 points, we need them badly. Confidence is there and hopefully a wonderful performance is too. Come on lads! Do the Black and White proud!
