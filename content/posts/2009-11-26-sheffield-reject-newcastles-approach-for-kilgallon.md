Sheffield United have today rejected an approach from an unnamed club for their prominent centre half, Matthew Kilgallon. This club is believed to be Newcastle United, especially after Chris Hughton confirmed that he was in the hunt for the 27 year old who doesn't have much time to run on his current contract at the Blades. Today however, Sheffield's manager Kevin  Blackwell has turned down the 'inquiry' claiming that the offer wasn't sufficient and that he hopes he can really keep hold of the York born defender until the end of the season at least.

Saying that, he would sell if the right amount of money is offered is only too aware of the players contract status.

Speaking today he said :

> _'There has been an inquiry about Matt that has been turned down because we did not think it represented value for money for us._

On the obvious matter that Kilgallon can walk scotch free in the summer, he said :

> _'He can, of course, go for nothing in the summer but we are not giving players away for nothing. In Matt's case, either way it is in his best interests to play as well as he can.'I believe that all the speculation has affected him because he hasn't been the same player that he was last season.'

> If I'm honest I think Kilgallon will be a Newcastle United player before too long and perhaps in January. It's good to see that Hughton is making these inquiries and that he's trying to make some progress. The rumoured fee is Â£5m and that, to say the least, is rather steep for the defender.
>
> All in all, I wouldn't mind seeing him arrive to St.James' Park, and should he arrive on a free/ Â£2 million fee, then you can't say it's bad business from Chris and co._

What do you make of Kilgallon's scenario?
