### Ashley - Is he ever going to sell up?

Another day passes, another week  has ended and we're nearly half way through another month, with still new owners in place. All we've had are rumours rumours and more rumours. We should be sold by now. Mike Ashley should be no longer in Newcastle, Derek Llambias no longer Managing Director. Mike didn't take long to take complete control of Newcastle from Freddy, so why is it taking so long? We're waiting far too long and we've been very patient. We've been told it would've been sold a week ago, then it changes, every day. Still no sale.

We've been linked with Malaysians, American's, Asians, Irish, English, Hong Kong, Austrian and hoaxes. Surely we've been put through enough torture as it is. Some say it's FS's fault it's taking so long because he agreed so many stupid deals, indeed that would play a major role in it, like having Owen half his wages at Manchester United and pay mark Viduka full wages because he hasn't found a new club. Utter shambles. It has to end, Ashley has to sell very soon, soon we are to be under new ownership, or we certainly hope so. Can you imagine us heading into the new Coca Cola Championship season with Mike Ashley still as owner and Joe Kinnear as manager, not to forget no incoming players and a steady stream of out goers. Hopefully this won't happen.
