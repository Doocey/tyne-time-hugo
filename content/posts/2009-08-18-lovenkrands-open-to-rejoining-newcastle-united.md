### Lovenkrands - May get his wish and return

Peter Lovenkrands may well come back to Newcastle United on a permanent basis it has been revealed. The Dane who signed for Newcastle on a free following his departure from Schalke saw Joe Kinnear snap him up on a contract until the  end of the season however with the constant uncertainty and no manager, Lovekrands was released on a free after he received a letter from Newcastle saying that he wasn't needed any more. However it appears now, with free and loan signings only on the cards as long as Ashley is in charge, the winger/forward may make a return to the club after all, providing he agrees to it.

A source close to Peter said :

> “Peter has been offered the chance to come back to Newcastle and is giving it some thought.”

Whilst Peter himself has been quoted as saying :

> “Staying in the UK is still my first priority, but I do not want to rule out anything right now.”

For me, Lovenkrands would be more than welcome to come back because he put in a good shift any time he came on, or indeed started. He scored against Manchester United, West Brom and Middlesbrough in his time at Newcastle and we might just see him back at St.James' before too long.

Comments welcome 🙂
