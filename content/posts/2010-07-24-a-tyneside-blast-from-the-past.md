### Sir Bobby Robson - Who'll ever forget his years in charge of Newcastle United?

The years during Sir Bobby Robson's tenure at Newcastle were perhaps the best days of the football club so far. A real gentleman in charge, that sent out a team capable of beating anyone. We were able to defeat anyone in those glorious years, years that saw us in the Champions League, in with big names such as Inter Milan, Juventus,Â BarcelonaÂ , so on and so forth.Â AmongstÂ many  great memories during Robson's era, there's one that sticks above all, even above us beating Sunderland all those times! I thought you might like a blast from the past so to speak. Enjoy.

Sir Bobby Robson - Gentleman & Geordie.
