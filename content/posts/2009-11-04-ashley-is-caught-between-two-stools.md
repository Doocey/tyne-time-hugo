### Ashley - All his eggs in one basket at Newcastle

If Newcastle United are not promoted come May, which is a very strong possibility, then Mike Ashley is in serious serious bother. After taking the club off the market for a second time, he now is hoping that we are brought straight back to the Premier League at first attempt, guided by Chris Hughton. To back up his hopes he's promised Chris that'll he'll back him both as manager and  in the transfer window. There are reports today that Hughton is already drawing up a list of possible arrivals and that Rosenborg midfielderÂ Per Ciljan Skjelbred is top of it.

However, what happens if Newcastle don't make the automatic promotion spots of lose out in the play-offs should they manage to get there? Mike isn't interested in a long term future at Newcastle but if they do manage to get promoted Ashley will look to exploit all avenues of revenue.

It was a choice for Ashley, either lower the price of the club and sell to Barry Moat of stay on, invest some cash and hope that the teams performs well enough to regain Premier League status. Obviously enough, he opted for the second option.

We hope that Mike does indeed stick to his word and invest money to get players to the club then there's a good chance of promotion happening. Basically it's up to Chris Hughton and the players now to do the business, because we know Mike's staying as is Chris.
