###Â Turner - Reported to be on Newcastle's summer list

Reports today have suggested that Newcastle are trailing Michael Turner, Hull's solid center back. Turner has been in great form for the Tigers this season chipping in with no less than 6 goals. Standing at 6'4 he has been great from corners this season. The former Brentford man would be perfect for us, alongside Bassong and I think he would jump at the chance to play for us should we stay in The Premier League this season. We have lacked goals form corners this season without a doubt, I am open to correction here but i believe that our last goal from a corner came at West Brom in our last win, Steven Taylor heading it home.

Coloccini hasn't looked good at ball this season and has been awful slow, the reason for many of our goals this season. Â He has on some occasions looked good alongside Sebastien however it has Bassong who has cleaned up Coloccini's mistakes. Fabrizio, who played every game for Deportivo in his last season has come close to it in his first season with us too but it's been quantity rather than quality. We hope that he can improve and get upto speed with the Premier League because he did cost Â£10.3m, a lot of money.

So what do you think, would Turner be a good addition? Would he do well alongside Bassong/Coloccini?
