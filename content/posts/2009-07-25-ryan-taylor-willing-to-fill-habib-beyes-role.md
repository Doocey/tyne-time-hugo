### Taylor - Hoping to improve on last season

Ryan Taylor today reiterated  his desire to remain at Newcastle by saying he wants to fill the departing Habib Beye's role at right back. Taylor, who arrive din January in a deal which saw Charles N'Zogbia go the other way, never got going in his first season and didn't settle too well. Today he revealed that that the behind the scene's going on's effected everyone's performances and training was far from a normal teams run out. We hope Ryan can come good this season because he has the potential, especially at free-kicks, indeed he was a very annoying player to play against when with Wigan, he continually scored against us, be it from a setpiece or a long range effort from play. Speaking today Ryan said he's looking forward to the new season.

Ryan said:

> 'My aim is to be the club's first-choice right-back. It's going to be difficult because of the quality in the squad. But I'm nearly 25 years old and I want to settle down in one position. I've played in numerous roles in the past - left midfield, right midfield.
>
> I'll do it, but I want one position only, and that is right back, and I'll do everything I can to force my way into the team.
>
> Last season was quite tough. I came here when the whole place was up in arms about what was going on behind the scenes. You could tell in training things weren't right.
>
> Things were better under Alan and Ian but it wasn't quite enough (to stay in the Premier League). But I want to forget about the past and look to rebuild this season. We can't wait to show what a good team we really are. I've had three different managers and that speaks for itself. Not only does it unsettle you, it unsettles everyone at the club. It's not nice going into games not knowing who's in charge from one week to the next.
>
> All of the managers I've played under at Newcastle have their own opinions of my best position. I want them to see the player I was when I was 18 or 19, growing up as a right-back. That's my best spot. I've never been in a settled position since I came here whereas if you get ten games under your belt in one position you become settled and understand your role much better.'

Indeed, it's positive vibes we're getting from Ryan, if only Shearer was installed as manager now, we'd have a huge chance of promotion, or the even the play-offs.
