### Gutierrez - A clearly delighted Toon supporter shows his delight at Jonas's mask!

We spoke about Newcastle's free-scoring form at St.James' Park this season and it continued again today with Barnsley the victims. 6 goals scored and five of them in the second half, including a rare goal from former Real Zaragoza winger Jonas Gutierrez, and what a goal it was. Cutting in from the left wing, he ghosted past two Barnsley markers before floating it into the top  corner off the backside of the crossbar. A great goal and a great celebration, finally the Spiderman mask revealed in very suiting conditions indeed.

Danny Guthrie had another brilliant game today and if you read Tyne Time regularly, you'll know that I'm a big fan of him and indeed predict big things in his career. His performance today and indeed his two goals will only strengthen the opinion amongst Newcastle United fans.

We all remember throwing away a 10 point lead at the top of the Coca Cola Championship around Christmas, and evening being knocked off the top a little less than a month ago. Well good news, we're now 9 points ahead with 12 games remaining. We couldn't have asked for anything more. West Brom losing away to now Neil Warnock's QPR and Nottingham Forest scraping a last-gasp winner against Paolo Sousa's Swansea City.

You can't help but smile at the performances the lads are churning out of late and especially the goals. Chris Hughton must surely have an eye on the Premier League already but still, we can't lose focus.

A slight damper on the result today was Daniel Bogdanovic's goal in the closing minutes, it would have been brilliant if we could have kept a clean sheet but I'm just being picky ðŸ˜€

As for both Dean 'Midas' Maynard's and indeed my own prediction on the game, we did expect Newcastle to score a few goals but no the six they did. I suppose you could say Dean was closer with his 3-1 prediction and if you add mine to his we get the exact result. Pure magic eh? ðŸ˜€

Tyne Time - **5pts**

Dean Midas Maynard - **5pts**

Lets continue onwards and upwards together NUFC.
