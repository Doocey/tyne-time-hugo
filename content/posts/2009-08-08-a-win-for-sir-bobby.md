### Players - Will dedicate 3 points to Bobby if they win

When Newcastle players grace the pitch today at half five, there will be a moment of silence for the great Sir Bobby Robson. Passing away at 76, the whole world mourned his death. As  George Caulkin rightly said, it brought the North East of England together. Seeing Newcastle United jerseys everywhere with a few patches of red and white, signaling the Sunderland respect it showed, as much as there was rivalry between the two sides, there is a very thin line between it. Every Championship game will hold a remembrance for Sir Bobby today, and indeed in the Premier League campaign when it starts. How perfect would three points for his beloved team be for him?

The players have said they want all three points today and we certainly hope they get them. As I said in my previous article, they are facing a very tough West Brom side, and we will see this at half five today. They have got reinforcements unlike ourselves and we have lost probably two of our best defenders in Sebastien Bassong and Habib Beye. It may be just as well we have got rid of them players as they were desperate to leave, now , it seems at least, that we've a team who want to play for the club and want to bring us back up to where we should be, the Premier League. Do it for Sir Bobby lads, a Gentleman and Geordie.
