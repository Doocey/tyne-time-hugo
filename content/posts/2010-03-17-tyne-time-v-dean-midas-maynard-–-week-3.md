For the third week running, we bring the tipping challenge of the century, between Tyne Time and one of the Worlds Leading Sports Psychics, Dean Midas Maynard. Last week we predicted a Newcastle United win away to Middlesbrough but neither of us gained any points because of the draw. I predicted a 1-3 Toon win so we got the four goals part right whereas  Dean was spot on the exact amount of goals Newcastle United scored in the game. Tonight we're up against Scunthorpe and we really hope for 3 points more than anything ðŸ™‚

The table is as stands :

&#8212;

Tyne Time : **5pts**

Dean Midas Maynard : **5pts**

&#8212;

Our predictions are as follows for tonight and once again, I can guarantee you both picks were made without the consent of each other. Basically, there's no copying going on, why would we bother?

More importantly we want Newcastle to win and stretch that lead at the top. If we keep winning these games then there's little stopping us from returning to the Premier League.

Comments welcome ðŸ™‚
