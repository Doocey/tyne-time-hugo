###Â Beckford - Scored his 20th of the season to knock United out of the FA Cup

I think most of us were delighted in some way to see Jermaine Beckford and Leeds United, knock Manchester United out of the FA Cup, at just the 3rd round. Beckford who you'll have probably heard, unless you've been under a stone for the last month, is being strongly linked with a move to Newcastle and within the next few days. However, after scoring in one of the biggest stages in the world in front of everyone, I think we'll see more than just Newcastle look to sign the striker. Beckford could've had a second too only for his shot was mis-hit in the last 10 minutes.

Speaking after the game Leeds' manager Simon Grayson talked up the strikers value, like any manager would, but more importantly, said he wants to keep the striker at Elland Road if he can.

Grayson said :

> _'There are three scenarios,'_

> _'He can either sign a new contract now, or we can keep him until the end of the season and he leaves then. The worst-case scenario is that we are offered some money now that is too good to turn down._

> _'But we would have to have replacements lined up if that was to happen.'_

You can't blame Grayson for wanting Beckford to stay but I think he'll find it hard to turn down some of the bids I'm sure the club will receive for the Englishman's services.

It's being reported that Â£1.5m - Â£2m will be enough to secure the man who knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup in historic terms. However, Grayson is adamant that Beckford won't leave on the cheap.

> _'We don't want him to leave unless it is the best thing for him and, long term, the football club. But, if we do let him go, we won't let him go on the cheap.'_

Either way, albeit only one goal on the big stage, Jermaine Beckford has proven that he could well be a very good player for Newcastle United, and for the mentioned price, he's definitely worth a shot.
