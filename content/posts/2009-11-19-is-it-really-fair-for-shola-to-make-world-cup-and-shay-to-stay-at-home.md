To be honest, I'm not in the best of moods today, mainly because France have cheated their way to the World Cup Finals in in South Africa at the expense of my nation, Ireland. Thierry Henry above all people blatantly handled the ball, not once but twice before laying it on William Gallas' head to head home an undeserved winner. I don't want to sound biased but obviously I  will as it's my country who have been denied a spot in South Africa. And to top things off, Shay Given our former keeper who kept us in many a game will yet again watch the World Cup at home, rather than take part in it.

As well as this, there are reports that Shola Ameobi could be called up the Nigerian squad which made the World Cup courtesy of Obafemi Martins and a late late strike.

What makes me rather sad is the fact the likes of Robbie Keane, Damien Duff, Richard Dunne, Keith Andrews, Kevin Doyle, and especially Shay Give, all Premier League players, will not feature in South Africa at all.

After playing France off the pitch and really should've scored a few more, Ireland as a nation, old and young are outraged and indeed the FAI, Irish Football Association have issued a complaint to FIFA and French FA looking for a replay.

I know the post is rather irrelevant to all you Newcastle fans but 66% of North East residents claim Irish roots. If you feel that the game deserves a replay then do sign [this Petition][1] . I know it mightn't do much, but for something so unjust to occur in such a vital game, please do voice your opinion.

Many thanks.
