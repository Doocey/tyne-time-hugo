### Martins - Everton, Arsenal and Villa apparently after him

There are reports and of course they were only a matter of time that, Obafemi Martins will leave NUFC soon. The Nigerian who played through the pain barrier in hope of Newcastle's safety, is the target or Aston Villa, Arsenal and now Everton. Indeed there will be no shortage of teams looking to sign Martins with his pace, agility and ability however they will also know that Oba  needs an operation and should they wait for him to have it at Newcastle it could be too late for a a summer signature. We don't expect Newcastle to pay or indeed look for Martins operation unless he commits himself to the cause and that, is doubtful.

It would be staggering is Martins decided to stay but his wages that are reported at around Â£80,000 a week would need to come down by two thirds. Then again if another club offer that amount, then you'd expect him to be on his bike. Everton or Villa won't offer anywhere near them wages as for Arsenal, well I'd be very surprised if he would pay Martins over 40,000 a week. He was a major success in his first season at St.James' and most Toon fans have a soft spot for the somersaulting little fella. However we're now a Championship team and have to look to get rid of players that don't fit the bill, it seems Martins is one of them.
