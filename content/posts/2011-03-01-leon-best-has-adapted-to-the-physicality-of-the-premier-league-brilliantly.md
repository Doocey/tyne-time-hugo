#### Best - Has thrived since Andy Carroll's departure to Liverpool in January

When Andy Carroll made his shock deadline day move to Liverpool FC for aÂ staggeringÂ initialÂ fee of Â£35m - Newcastle United fans started to worry as to where our goals for the remainder of the Premier League campaign would come from. It might be easy to say now, but I never doubted our ability to score goals with or without the Newcastle bornÂ front-man. The important thing  was that we had fit strikers; any forward in the EPL can score goals if they are given the right service. Since then, Irish international Leon Best has impressed all round scoring an impressive 5 goals in Â under 10 games. AÂ hat-trickÂ on hisÂ dÃ©butÂ against West Ham, followed by one against Arsenal and indeed Birmingham in games which we didn't lose.

What has impressed me about Best is that he has both taken his chance very well as a striker for Newcastle United and secondly that he has adapted very well so far with what is required in the Premier League. He was possibly a littleÂ understrengthÂ physically for the Premier League in his first couple of games but since then he has shown a real grit and determination against every centre half he has been put up against.

A prime example of this was at home to Bolton on Saturday. A game we could have well won if it wasn't for Ryan Taylor's sending off, with that said; Leon Best hassled defenders, rose the highest to win headers and indeed was very unlucky not to have had another goal or two to add to his growing tally in a Toon shirt.

Although unofficial I think Newcastle United have done enough to merit Premier League survival. We look at the likes of Wigan, Wolves, West Ham, and West Brom. They have shown a real lacklustre desire to stay in the league although West Ham's impressive win at home against Liverpool could be the start of a Premier League survival scrap. My point being, NUFC are better than all those sides. It may seem biased, but the Premier League table doesn't lie.

We've beaten West Ham in both encounters, drawn and beaten Wigan, drawn with Wolves and have yet to play them and West Brom at home this season. It bodes well for us.

I have no doubt that Leon Best can get into double figures this season, following Andy, and Kevin: with Shola not too far behind either. As long as Best can avoid any injuries, and keep working then we will have a very capable Premier League striker on our hands.

Once we're a confirmed Premier league team for next year we can look forward to buying some very good young players using our scouting team. That's even before we mention Hatem Ben Arfa's return to the Newcastle United side.
