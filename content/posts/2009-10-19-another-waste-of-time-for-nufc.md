###Â Ashley - About to take NUFC off the market - again

I'm sorry if this article sounds a bit pessimistic but it's hard not to be on a downer. News has broken today that Chris Hughton will be offered the full-time job and that later this week he'll accept the final terms of what I'm sure will be quite a lucrative contract. However, that's not the bad part, actually that probably the best news we could have expected. The bad news is , this more than likely signals that Mike Ashley will continue his torrid tenure at Newcastle United. This will be the second time within months that Mike will have taken the club off the market.

My headline may be a little harsh but I think it's quite accurate all the same. The sale negotiations, the deadlines, the transfer embargoes and all the rest, have wasted a lot of time for the club, and indeed the rebuilding project.

Chris Hughton without a doubt has done a great job but whether the permanent vacancy suits him is another thing. I can't help but refer to Ricky SbragiaÂ at Sunderland where he, as caretaker, did quite a good job, but once permanent, failed to produce.

We hope the same won't happen with Chris, if he does accept the full-time job , which we expect he will. However, maybe things will be different. Perhaps he might just keep the team going and push for promotion. The next task it away to Scunthorpe, and I can assure you, it won't be an easy game.

What do you think of Chris as Newcastle United's next permanent manager?
