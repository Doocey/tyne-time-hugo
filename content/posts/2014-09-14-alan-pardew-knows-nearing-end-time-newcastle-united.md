I have often felt some sort of empathy towards Newcastle United managers in the past who have been shown the door at St. James' Park. In fact, in years gone-by, 'revolving door' became a common buzzword on Tyneside when talking about managers. Realistically, Sir Bobby Robson should never have been sacked in 2004 after the club drifted just outside the Champions League places. From then on, things just got worse. His replacement Graeme Souness couldn't hack it in the North-East, although certain personalities in the dressing-room made it even more difficult for the Scot to succeed. Then came along Glenn Roeder who did a decent job overall, but inevitably he didn't have the quality to bring the club to the next level. Then came Sam Allardyce, and then **Mike Ashley** appeared. He fired Sam, recruited Keegan before forcing his resignation, appointing Alan Shearer, the he was eventually replaced by the gentlemanly Chris Hughton.

Of course as you might have guessed, Hughton was sacked despite leading NUFC back to the Premier League in historic fashion. It was a move from Mike Ashley which I felt was mistimed, and showed little loyalty to a man who had saved his asset from financial ruin.

Now, it is that loyalty which is killing this football club. Hughton's replacement, Alan Pardew has lost the support of the majority of Newcastle United fans, and at the time of writing, NUFC sit bottom of the Premier League table, failing to win one game so far this campaign, and their latest result, a 0-4 thrashing at the hands of Southampton.

We are half way through the month of September, and it appears that Mike Ashley is considering his options. Bottom line, he wants to protect his investment any way possible. If he feels that the club could genuinely suffer relegation under the current stewardship, then I am quite sure he will pull the trigger on Mr. Pardew. It should have been done long ago, mind.

For AP, he knows the game is up, with supporters at least. One comment in his rare post-match interview with Sky Sports which stuck out to me was this:

> 'They [criticisms] are fair because you can't get beat 4-0 as Newcastle manager'

I may be alone, but I think that he is pulling a punch at the fans with that remark, perhaps suggesting that he thinks we are expecting too much. The least we can expect is a fight and desire every game, and I haven't seen that in a long, long time.

He later told 5live:

> “Until told otherwise, I will continue to prepare the team for next weekend.”

From watching us this season, I believe the players have lost faith in Pardew and that he facing an impossible job to motivate his starting eleven to record a much-needed win.

His time is up at SJP, and he knows it too.

Up to you Mike, do what's right for the club.
