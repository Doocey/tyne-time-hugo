## Elano - One of a number of players linked

Blumer Elano is just one of a number of players linked strongly to Newcastle United in this January transfer window and it appears he could well make the switch to us. It is no secret Elano is a quality on his day as we saw against us with his free kick üòê and it is also obvious he is surplus to requirements at Eastlands, for some time now. Elano does not seems to get along with Mark Hughes at all, with the signings of Kompany and Robinho plus Stephen Ireland in CM too it is hard for Elano to get any playing time. Elano would be a good addition and shouldn't break the bank, considering City don't need any money, I think ¬£4 - 6m would be a reasonable price for the AM. Newcastle fans seem rather happy to take Elano and would be satisfied with him as first of a few signings, He would add creativity to the center which we desperately need ever since Emre's departure. Adding this will give our strikers more chances that Owen thrives on, so in turn more goals would be scored üôÇ

In other news, John Arne Riise is the reported LB we are chasing as cover for Enrique. No doubt Riise would be a good addition to our squad as we're pretty thin in the LB area with Enrique the only natural in that position (although he loves to get forward :D) Price for Riise could be no more than ¬£2-3m as he's aging. We hope the recruitment team can get him and indeed Elano in quickly and for a decent price. Then it would reassure fans that Ashley has given money to spend and indeed show Ashley's vision for Newcastle United Football Club.

Comments Appreciated
