### Bassong - Will be sorely missed in Chelsea game

There is some bad news today that both local lad Steven Taylor and our best center back this season, Sebastien Bassong could be out for some time as both suffered nasty injuries v Arsenal on Saturday. Taylor who was excellent on Saturday, blocking a definite van Persie goal before blocking out Arshavin in similar circumstances. Taylor however picked up a injury and was taken off, 10 men played for Newcastle when Diaby scored an important goal which effectively ended the game for the Toon.

To make things worse on top of the defeat it the fact we lost Bassong and Taylor who have been on their games in this rough patch. With Chelsea and Stoke away coming up we need 3 points out of one of those games if not 4. If we got 4 points it would be excellent as teams around us have as tough fixtures to play. Some fans have already lost faith, if you'd like to call them fans but I am very confident we can stay up. I was confident we could have beaten Arsenal too but it didn't happen although our 1st half performance may have started to convince you a little.

To stay up two wins and two draws should, and i emphasize should, be enough to maintain our Premier League status next year and with Pompey, Boro' and Fulham all coming up at home surely we can?
