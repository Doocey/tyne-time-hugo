### Andrews - Reportedly wanted by Chris Hughton to bolster midfield

The Sunday Papers are at it again per usual. Today they again threw up some tasty yet laughable rumours which you love to hate. The latest, is that Chris Hughton is looking to strengthen the midfield up, with Keith Andrews his preferred target. I must say, being an Irishman and seeing Andrews play internationally, he's nothing special. Far from it actually, he's a  typical Sam Allardyce player, works hard and tackles hard. The only good game I've ever seen him play in an Ireland shirt was the night in Paris, where Ireland were denied a World Cup spot.

On top of all this, the icing on the cake is that Sam Allardyce wants Alan Smith in exchange. Smith, who has captained the side for large parts of the season is still unproven but far from the free-scoring forward he used to be, and Sam Allardyce can be thanked for that if you ask me.

I'm not at all surprised to see that Blackburn are indeed being linked to Smith, Big Sam is a big fan of the lad, and when in charge of Newcastle United, dished out Â£6m to Manchester United for his services. A big price to play for a player who hasn't set St.James' Park alight it's fair to say.

I don't want Andrews, he's getting older and we don't need anymore rusty midfielders that could well spend a long time on the treatment table. As well as this, Joey Barton is close to returning so that would immediately rule out any move for Andrews for the time being.

So if you're to look at it from every angle, I think you'll find that the Sunday Sun have again reported a pretty spectacular rumour with no truth in at all. It's not that spectacular either really.

If Keith Andrews signs tomorrow, I'll look a little foolish though eh? ðŸ˜€ We need to keep Alan Smith anyway.
