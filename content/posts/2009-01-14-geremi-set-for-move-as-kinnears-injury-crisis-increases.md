It always seems to happen to Newcastle doesn't it? Countless injuries, it doesn't happen to any other, just us. Whether its a lack of warming up at training or poor pitches we train on nobody knows but what is for certain, we're all sick and tired of the mountain of players on the treatment table. Kinnear called an emergency meeting last night with chairman Derek Llambias and spoke to Mike Ashley over the telephone, Joe who is still most probably waiting on an answer from MA has commented and thrown bait at the subject. The lack of players tonight against Hull in the cup is ridiculous, the FA Cup which may be our only hope of getting to a respectable stage of any competition has been altered and it seems young Tamas Kadar and Nile Ranger could well both play the majority of the game. We've now problem of playing youth and some Toon fans see it as a mixed blessing as it gives Kinnear no other chance but to play some young blood, as well as Xisco ðŸ˜€

Geremi on the other hand who arrived from Chelsea on a free is on the verge of completing a move away from St.James', when we are so low on number this is far from encouraging but we have been assured once on player goes out, another will come in, then we're hoping for another 4 please! Kinnear has spoken of a danger of Newcastle going down if they do not get any reinforcements and this is true, frighteningly true. Of course it is another reason for MA to spend which he done very little of to say the least. Names have been linked to Newcastle throughout the market and the latest two linked are Frenchman Albin Ebondo and Cameroon International StÃ©phane Mbia. Mbia is well known of because he has been on Newcastle's shortlist for some time now with Everton another one of his suitors. All these rumours, most nonsense but we're expecting some players, in all the same.

Comments appreciated
