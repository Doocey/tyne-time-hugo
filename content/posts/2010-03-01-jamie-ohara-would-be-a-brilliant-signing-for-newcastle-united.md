### O'Hara - A very good player and would be a great addition to Newcastle United

There are usual reports in the papers about Portsmouth and their financial worries in the last few days and more than likely, Pompey will be a Coca Cola Championship club come May this year. It's been a big drop for a club who only a couple of years ago lifted the FA Cup with Harry Redknapp in charge. Since then, the club who used to boast the likes of Jermaine Defoe, Peter  Crouch, Niko Kranjcar, Sol Campbell and indeed Sylvain Distin. Now all the stories regarding the club are about departures and indeed their uncertain future as a football club.

One man who has been committed to the Pompey cause throughout the turbulent time has been Jamie O'Hara. The midfielder, on-loan from Tottenham has shown real grit in the centre of the park for Avram Grant's side and whether he still has a future at either club, remains to be seen.

However, in the last couple of days we've been linked with the 23 year-old and it's pleasing to say the least. Sure we have a lot of similar midfielders in Joey Barton, Alan Smith, Danny Guthrie, Kevin Nolan and so forth. Needless to say, some faces will be moved on in the summer regardless of what division we're in, and I think O'Hara would be a perfect addition.

I've always rated Jamie and I know I'm not alone but it's not just that, he seems the determined type and isn't someone to say he wants out of a club, as soon as a tough period comes about. This can be seen during his stint at Pompey. He returned to Spurs in January but wanted desperately to return to Fratton Park and his wish was granted, with the Pompey fans delighted to see him back.

I think it's fair to say that he will not be a Portsmouth player come the end of the season and should we be a Premier League club by then, I think it's definitely worth making a bid for him. I don't think he will feature in Harry Redknapp's plans although the same was said for Roman Pavlyuchenko and look at him now.

Either way, onwards and upwards from a Toon fans perspective. On a side note, our condolences go out to Charlie Crowe. A legend who pulled on the Black And White stripes of Newcastle with pride passed away yesterday, may he RIP.
