##3 Gutierrez - Looking good in training

St.James' Park allowed local fans in today, to see Alan Shearer train the Newcastle United first team. In what was quite a pleasant day, Toon fans both young and old got a lengthy glimpse of what they might expect in the forthcoming Stoke match on Saturday. Joey Barton and Mark Viduka both took part in their own session, mainly for fitness whilst Danny Guthrie didn't train however it's expect he'll play against Stoke at the weekend. There is also speculation that Obafemi Martins could be dropped in place of Andy Carroll who scored twice v Manchester City reserves last night. Should Martins be dropped?

Shearer said today :

_“I asked all of the lads who had been involved with the first team to go and play for the reserves.” “I asked them to put in a performance and they’ve all done that. All of them will have a part to play.”

“The mood has been very good in training.” “It’s been very positive despite what happened on Saturday against Chelsea.” “Everybody has come in and worked very hard.”

 _“I asked Andy to go out and show me what he could do, and he’s done that.”

“Like all of the lads who came from the first team, he showed a great appetite and a great attitude.”_

So who will start is still unknown but Big Andy might be in with a big shout for a starting spot versus the Potters.

Comments appreciated 🙂
