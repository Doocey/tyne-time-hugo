### Taylor - Signing confirmed but more faces needed

Ryan Taylor's transfer to Newcastle is in the bag after Kinnear unveiled our second signing with an hour left in the window. Taylor come part of a deal which sees N'Zogbia o he other way plus we get Â£6m, thanks very much Bruce ðŸ˜€ This is not enough though as we need more numbers and we really hope for more faces before 5pm or not too late after that time. Joe is certainly happy with his purchase and I am too, however another couple signings wouldn't go wrong.

Joe said:
  > _'I'm over the moon to get Ryan because he is still a young player but one with a lot of experience.'He's played nearly 200 career games and is still only 24.

      'His versatility is tremendous, he can play on the left or the right and in defence or midfield.

      'He's a total footballer in that he's got two good feet and is very good on the ball.

      'He's another Scouse lad like Kevin Nolan with a great character and we're very happy to get him on board.'_

More players please, Johnston would be nice, maybe a defender and a striker too.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
