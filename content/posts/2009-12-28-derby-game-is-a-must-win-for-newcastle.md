###Â Savage - Always looking to upset an opponents rhythm

With West Brom leading away to Scunthorpe as I write this post, the importance of our game against Derby County at 5.30 has doubled. No longer are we 10 points clear at the top, indeed it will be a lot closer than that if West Brom win at Scunny. Not only are Brom closing the gap but Cardiff City who are four goals to the good away to Peterborough, are finding themselves in the  hierarchy of the playoffs yet again. The thing is, tonights game at Derby is a must win, no excuses. If we mess up this evening then it could be a big turning point in both ours, and our rivals season.

Saying that, we needn't worry, because we're pretty sure that the lads will have enough for a team that got beaten singlehanded by a 33 year-old a few days ago. From my viewing of Derby, they play the back four very very high up the field and a few simple balls by either Danny Guthrie or Nicky Butt, could have Shola Ameobi on his bike.

Needless to say, their approach to this match could change drastically, they might just sit back and try to defend for the whole game and if lucky, come away with a point. I think we all know that them sort of teams tend to frustrate the opposition and sometimes, get the better of them.

An early goal and perhaps a few in-between should hopefully get us through County, in what will be I'm sure, a very filled St.James' Park, or at least I hope so. I'm not too sure about you guys, but I'll be wary of tonights game, Derby could throw something at us that we're not expecting.

Although doing rather poorly this term, Nigel Clough's men never back down from a challenge and especially their influential figure in Robbie Savage. The former Blackburn man who now tends to appear on the 'Football League Show' often, will be relishing the chance to lock horns with Newcastle's centre midfield paring.

As I said, a must win game tonight. Come on lads, end the year for us loyal Toon fans on a high.

**Tyne Time's Prediction** Newcastle 3-1 Derby County
