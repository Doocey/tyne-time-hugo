### Jonas - Lining out for Argentina tonight

Newcastle United winger Jonas Gutierrez will tonight line out in what is a must win game for Argentina. If the Argies, led by former World Cup legend and the founder of the hand of god, Maradona, lose tonight, then their chances of making usually a familiar trip to the World Cup Finals, will be over. Maradona who claimed staggeringly, that his first three names on the  Argentina team sheet were Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and Newcastle United's very own Jonas Gutierréz will as you'd expect start Jonas tonight and we certainly hope he comes back injury free.

However, Jonas wouldn't be lining out in his baby blue and white striped jersey if it wasn't from a gracious will from manager Chris Hughton.

Indeed Jonas has credited them, saying today :

> _“It was fundamental Newcastle gave their permission for me to receive physical treatment in Argentina.”_

We certainly hope he comes back unscathed but you just never know. IN other news, internationally, Toon 'star' Geremi was on the score sheet in a 3-0 win for Cameroon over Togo.

The break will do the Toon faithful good as we hope to bounce back with three points against Nottingham Forest.

Comments welcome.
