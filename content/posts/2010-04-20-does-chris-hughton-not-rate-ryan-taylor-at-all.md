###Â Taylor - Hasn't seen a whole lot of playing time on Tyneside this season

A great win yesterday and a very successful season to say the least. Thank you Chris Hughton, thank you supporters and indeed our thanks to the players. That aside, there's been something in the back of my mind all the time and I have to bring it up. Ryan Taylor arrived from Wigan Athletic over a season ago, in the January transfer window alongside Kevin Nolan and came here with  high hopes. I must say I was excited at the prospect of having the free-kick expert on Tyneside to apply his skills to set pieces and indeed to bolster a side that lacks a real set-piece taker, Danny Guthrie aside.

Throughout this season, we've mixed our side up a bit but I must say, Ryan Taylor hasn't really featured as much as he should. He played in the early stages, like at Crystal Palace where he scored a lovely goal and indeed at Ipswich where he too netted a delightful free-kick. Mind you, he's come off the bench in a lot of the matches and scored straight away like at home to Barnsley and against Coventry City if memory serves me right.

I think Taylor is a good player and indeed a good RM. With the arrival of Wayne Routledge, it has been hard for the lad to get into the side and I must say I feel sorry for him. I just hope he isn't forced out of the club because we could certainly use someone with his experience both in the Premier League and cups.

I'd like to think Chris does rate him but it'll be interesting to see if he features much more in the Coca Cola Championship's remaining fixtures or indeed , in the upcoming Premier League campaign.
