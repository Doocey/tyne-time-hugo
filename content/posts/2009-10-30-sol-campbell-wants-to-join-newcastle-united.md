###Â Campbell - Newcastle his preferred destination

Sol Campbell has today came out and told Sky Sports News that he wants to join Newcastle United. Campbell who is a free transfer after leaving Notts County after only one game, is hoping for a switch to Newcastle, after he settles his contract dispute with his former club. It's quite random news and it will be interesting to see whether Chris is interested in signing him. Only a  few months ago, Newcastle were reportedly interested in securing his services but it's understood that his wage demands were too high and opted for the League 2 side.

He said :

> 'I have been approached by several clubs and, yes, it is correct to say that Newcastle are one of them,' he said.
>
> 'People might be surprised to hear me say that I would be very interested in a move there, but I have my reasons.
>
> 'Also, Newcastle are a big club and could be heading back to the Premier League. It appeals.
>
> 'If we can sort it all out at the tribunal I would hope to be playing within weeks from now.
>
> 'I am training every day with Arsenal, feel fit, as fit as ever, and now I really need some matches.
>
> 'But to sort out the mess at Notts County, a Football League tribunal seems to be the only way out.'

We really do wonder if this guy is good enough because his debut against Morecambe was a complete disaster, and that's two divisions below us. Mind you, he considers himself good enough to be playing Premier League football.

There's no doubt that he was an influential figure under Harry Redknapp at Pompey but since then he's completely disappeared off the scene. I can remember the day he arrived at Notts County, claiming that he was hoping for a place in Fabio Capello's World Cup England squad.

Is this guy good enough for Newcastle's defence or is Chris even really considering him?
