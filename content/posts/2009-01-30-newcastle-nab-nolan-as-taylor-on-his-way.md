## Taylor - Set for Newcastle move

Unexpectedly Newcastle are moving quickly in the final few days of the window and have completed the signing of Kevin Nolan from Bolton for a fee in the region of Â£4m. That deal itself took less than 24 hours to complete and may have triggered something in the recruitment team to work even quicker. With N'Zogbia leaving Sky Sports have confirmed that Ryan Taylor is heading to Newcastle, and no. not to score another freekick against us! Taylor is set to sign to the Magpies and I'm delighted with this ðŸ˜€

Taylor who is known for his goal scoring abilities, against Newcastle, has been talks with the Toon Army since today and it seems he is prime to move to the North East. The deal will take N'Zogbia the other way and we get â‚¬6.5m too, not a bad deal if you ask me. Most newcastle fans will be glad to get rid of 'Le Sulk' and are even happier with the fact we are getting Ryan Taylor + 6.5m for him. The transfers need to keep coming like this with only days remaining. Albin Ebondo deal is off after Toulouse got too greedy on their asking price, increasing it from Â£3m to Â£6m so basically them can keep him, for now anyways. Updates coming as the transfer window hits full speed!
