### Cash won't tempt loyal Given

News has just broke of Shay Given being bidded for by money burners City, what a surprise! Their interest has been far from private with a long list of suitors to City's cause and not just in keepers. The bid is meant to be in the region of Â£8m and personally I believe that is an insult to Newcatsle United and indeed Shay Given himself. If Given is to leave he is surely to go for half of what Buffon would've of indeed three quarters of his price.Buffon was offered â‚¬100m and with the current exchange rate, that isin't far off Â£100m sterling, Given is worth a least Â£15-25m at the minimum and with reports that Kinnear has to sell, will this hash of an offer leave him in no position but to accept? Reports are also suggesting Spurs will make a move soon.

On another front, Newcastle are supposedly close to capturing their first signing of the January transfer window. The position is unknown but LB and AM have been priorities for Newcastle for some time now. Problems with Xisco and the FIFA rules may block a move and keep him here. Nothing taken for granted but expect some development on the transfer front, whether it's with Shay of an incoming player to NUFC remains to be seen.
