###Â Enrique - Being realistic about cup chances

Jose Enrique, speaking today has rubbished Newcastle's chances of winning the Carling Cup this year, saying we simply 'don't have the legs for it'. He may well be right too you know, and is being realistic. Not many Toon fans are ever too confident when it comes to cups with Newcastle and the likelihood is, we'll be nowhere near the major stages of this competition when it comes  into it's prime. However, you just never know, a domestic cup would be cherished in Newcastle for some time but the league is our main objective.

Speaking today, Enrique said :

> 'My opinion is that it's near impossible to win the cup,'
>
> 'We have a little squad, and when you play against Championship or League One teams, it's OK, but when you play against Premier League teams, it's different.
>
> 'You need 100 per cent concentration in the league, because we want to go back to the Premier League.'

We know that's he's probably right but he's definitely correct in saying we have too small of a squad. We're meant to have Maron Harewood arriving and he'll add some power upfront, but that's not enough.
