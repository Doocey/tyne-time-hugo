### Pancrate - Will more than likely depart St.James' at the end of the season

Fabrice Pancrate arrived on a free from France earlier this season and on his full debut, scored an absolute screamer to seal a very good three points at home to Watford. It was a brilliant bit of skill from the 30 year-old but since then, we've seen very little of the former PSG winger. In fact, Pancrate is reportedly already making plans for life after Newcastle United and indeed when our  Coca Cola Championship campaign comes to an end. It's not a surprise really but I suppose it's quite ironic, considering this is the guy who claimed 'I bleed black and white blood' or something to that effect! ðŸ˜€

He isn't making the real big news though, but instead our tie at home to Sheffield United is because if we even manage a draw, then we'll be back in the Premier League.

There's no stopping Chris Hughton's Army making their way to the Barclays Premier League now but we'd really like to reach the 100pt mark while we're at it. In order to do that, we'd pretty much need to win every game from now until the end and I think it's a possibility.

Being back in the Premier League again reopens so many avenues for the club. A big increase in TV revenue, a new shirt sponsorship deal with Puma, increased revenue from higher ticket prices and indeed and overall positive effect on the city of Newcastle.

We earned the right to play in the Premier League this year and it seems as if, two of the three teams relegated last year, including ourselves and West Bromwich Albion will be returning once again.

The real question now though is how we'll fare in the Premier League? We certainly need to buy 5 or 6 players and not Championship ones either. I'd love a move for Jamie O'Hara, and maybe even Stephen Hunt if Hull City happen to go down.

Obviously we expect Chris Hughton to have plans made already of whom he'll go after but we're pretty sure there won't be any arrivals over the Â£10m mark this summer, compared to previous ones.

All the hard work by Chris Hughton, Colin Calderwood and the medical team has paid off and we'll need to work even harder to stay in the Premier League. One bridge at a time eh? 3 points at home to Sheffield and we're there, **_officially_**.
