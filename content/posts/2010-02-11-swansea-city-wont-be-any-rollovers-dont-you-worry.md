### Trundle - Will certainly be up for Newcastle United encounter in Wales

There's no doubting the fact that we need to get three points in our next Championship game which happens to be away to a high-flying Swansea City. As Roberto Martinez departed for pastures anew in the shape of Wigan Athletic, another foreigner seized control, by the name of Paulo Sousa, and he's doing a pretty decent job at the Welsh club so far. Although we did cruise to  victory against City at home last year, it'll be a different scenario when we visit the Liberty Stadium, which is sure to be packed to the rafters full of expectant Swansea fans (and Toon fans :D).

Lee Trundle, on-loan from Bristol City is sure to have a field day and has a habit of scoring against big clubs. He'll certainly be a threat both in the air and with the ball at his feet. As we saw with Rob Hulse, these sort of guys thrive on playing against the bigger clubs and it'll no different with Swansea's hitman.

The whole team has put out an appeal for a big performance come Saturday and so has the likes of Kevin Nolan, Steve Harper etc for us. It really us a must win game for us, otherwise we could see ourselves loosening our grip on the Coca Cola Championship title and we don't want that do we?

Everyone can go on about it being a must win game and the fact that the team will perform on Saturday, however, as well as the fact that we need to play well, we need to stop Swansea City getting a grip on the game, and more importantly, stop them scoring.

As we saw against Derby in the 3-0 mauling, if we go one down, then there's every chance it could become two or three. We must score once and hopefully add to our lead.

If we can reproduce any of the form like we did against Cardiff then we stand every chance of walking away from the Liberty Stadium with all three points, and the man above knows we need them more than anybody.
