### Barton - Will he miss the crucial tie with West Brom?

Perhaps I'm looking into things just a little too much but it's occurred to me, as I'm sure it has to you, that West Bromich Albion are hot on the tails of Newcastle in the Coca Cola Championship. Today, we were a little lacklustre in midfield and missed Alan Smith. Nicky Butt played well in many periods of the game but in fairness to the man, he wouldn't be first choice in the middle of the  park. That brings us all to Joey Barton, the infamous midfielder that has made more headlines for his adventures off the field rather than on it.

Barton is due back in the future and the sooner the better, or at least I think so. It's no lie to say that Barton is a very good footballer but one that probably after all he has done, doesn't deserve to be a professional footballer or live the life of one.

Speaking about Barton, Hughton said :

> _“We are still looking at him joining in training in the third week in January._
>
> _“Then it will be down to his fitness levels as to when he is ready to join in with the squad.”_

We play West Brom on the 18th of January in St.James' Park, in what will prove to be a very important fixture regards promotion hopes. If Barton is set to return to training in the third week, I really expect he means sooner, and that Joey could well be able to play first team with a few weeks.

I know his injury isn't as simple as that, but we'd expect him back a little before the time estimated by Chris. I certainly hope he'll be back sooner than that but we must make sure he isn't rushed, and makes the necessary progress.

On the topic of Barton, Steven Taylor said :

> _“Joey has missed so much, and I know for a fact he works so hard in the gym._
>
> _“He will want to prove a point and show why he wants to be at this football club – he will be like a new signing for us._
>
> _“He is a top player, and we need those type of players back._
>
> _“Teams will not be able to cope with him and Kevin Nolan – they do not have the quality they have – but in the meantime we have the quality on the pitch to win any game.”_

Taylor is certainly very confident about Barton's and indeed Newcastle's chances this season. Certainly Kevin Nolan is doing the business for us, and contributing a fair share of goals too, something that we might just get from Joey too.

That said, we need him back from injury because like him or hate him, he's a talented lad on the ball and we hope he does his future talking on the pitch.

Comments welcome 🙂
