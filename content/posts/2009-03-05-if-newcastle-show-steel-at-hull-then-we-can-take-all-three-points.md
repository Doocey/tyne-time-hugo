### Lovenkrands - Scored last night to tear Van der Sar's recore to tatters 😛

I think we can all say when Peter Lovenkrands tapped the ball into the net at St.James' Park after 9 minutes last night we all were ecstatic, it came as a shock to us but to Alex Ferguson and Edwin Van der Sar. The Dutch man only needed to keep a clean sheet for another 89 minutes before the Newcastle game and it looked pretty straight forward, from a Newcastle fan's perspective too. Not only had United (Manchester this is) been unstoppable this year, they too had kept a great clean sheet record and tipped for every cup going this year mind.

However, I think we all knew when Lovenkrands and the Mighty Magpie fans had finished their celebration it was back to business and a Red Devils equaliser was imminent. Indeed Rooney fired a fine shot into the back of the net 10 minutes later with the aid of Steven Taylor's back. Saying this Newcastle kept their heads up and began to attack again, mind you should Enrique's ball to Lovenkrands have been a little better the man from Denmark could've had his second of the night however it wasn't to be.

Shortly into the second half Berbatov made it 2-1 from some unfortunate defending 🙁 . After that we pressed again introducing Carroll and Kazenga Lua Lua. Some Newcastle fans were outraged that Vidic wasn't shown a red card after apparently obstructing the little Nigerian on his way to goal. Regarding this title, if we can show this steely determination we showed against The World Club, Carling, and Premier League champions we can stay up, I know it. We can beat Hull and certainly put it up to Arsenal and Chelsea. The nerves are being racked each game but safety will calm them, until August at least 🙂

Comments appreciated 🙂
