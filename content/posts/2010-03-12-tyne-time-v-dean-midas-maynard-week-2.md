###Â Tyne Time v Dean Maynard in tipping challenge

With Newcastle traveling to Middlesbrough tomorrow, **Tyne Time** continues it's feature which see us put our wits up against one of the leading sports psychics in the world, Dean Midas Maynard. As mentioned in the previous weeks posts, Dean is quite a famous sports psychic and has worked with many football clubs. This week, we go head to head to see who can predict the exact result for  the Boro derby, or indeed the closest thing to a derby we'll get this season anyway.

The leader-board as of last week, with 12 games remaining including the Boro one, looks like this :

&#8212;

Tyne Time - 5pts

Dean Midas Maynard - 5pts

&#8212;

A big shout out to Simon Atkinson a friend of mine, for helping me get in contact with the ever busy Dean for his Tyne Time prediction as his computer was out of action. Cheers fella.

Of course I fully expect Tyne Time to reign victorious in this overall challenge but I think it's more important that Newcastle United are victors at The Riverside tomorrow.

Boro's home form has been quiet good and they'll be up for it. Let's hope that we can score a few goals and get the ball down and pass it. Tomorrow will not be an easy game for sure (even though my prediction make indicate otherwise! )

I think Newcastle can replicate their performance in their last encounter and win by 2 clear goals. I do feel we'll score 3 for some reason but we might go behind first. Wouldn't do if it's a boring 0-0 draw now would it!
