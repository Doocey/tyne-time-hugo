You'd think the takeover of Newcastle United FC must  be nearing completion but then again, that's the problem, we don't know. Apparently two bidders are left and Freddy Shepperd is **not** one of them. A source revealed tonight who the American interest is but it's credibility is very questionable. Speaking to a tabloid paper, bare in mind, it's Sunday, the source revealed that American bidder (if there is one) is a guy by the name of Larry Page who plays a major role in Google. He's worth a nice $15.8 bn and he's 36 years old. His age alone makes me doubt his interest.

The source said :

> 'Larry has talked about Newcastle United for some time now, he's a sports fan and noticed that Newcastle suffered a major setback which was relegation. Of course Mr.Page has a taste for money and believes Newcastle Football Club would be a good acquisition for himself'
>
> 'He's interested but before he considers buying, he wants to know what he's getting in to, regards the club itself'

Seems a little dodgy to me, but I could be surprised and he ends up actually buying the club. Remember, it's Sunday, don't hold your breath.
