###Â Team - Top the league and a nice way to end the year

As Christmas is over and we enter a new year, it again brings back the memories of 2009 and all those incidents. Sportingwise, I cannot forget Newcastle's relegation from the Premier League or indeed the way in Ireland missed out on a World Cup place yet again. However, in a few hours we will have entered a new era, 2010. A new decade. I'd just like to wish you all a Happy New  Year and hope that your luck will turn out good. With Newcastle on top of the Championship at the minute, it was a nice way to end the year as a Newcastle fan.

We'll see you in 2010 and don't party too hard!

Happy New Year,

Doocey.
