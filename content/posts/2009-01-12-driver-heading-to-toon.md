## Andrew Driver - Latest player linked to Newcastle


New reports today suggest Newcastle are making a move for Andrew Driver of Hearts, the speculation is widespread throughout Scotland and some Hearts' fans have already resigned to losing the Englishman. Born in Oldham, Driver moved to Scotland and his footballing skills did not go unnoticed as the Jambos signed the young lad up.

Driver is around 5'9& in height and can play on the left wing or upfront where he played previously for his club before Hearts. Everton have been long admirers of him and had a formal bid in the region of Â£900k rejected in the summer. Driver who only signed a new deal in 06 has expressed his desire to play in England at one stage and we all think a short move to Newcastle would do the trick ðŸ˜€ The fee is reportedly around Â£1.5m which isn't a whole lot if this lads brings his lightning speed. On a down side Â£1.5m may show the lack of funds Joe Kinnear has at his disposal and if this is the case, there will be a lot of disheartened Toon fans out there, including me.

One of Driver's most memorable moments came when he sent a screamer into the net against Celtic in 2007, a sublime free kick that had even Nakamura feeling the heat ðŸ˜› It remains to be seen who we are going to bring in, so far **Peter LÃ¸venkrands** is trialing with us and that is as far as we are at the minute. Kinnear has revealed that the scouting network within NUFC are on a continuous mission around the world to find the very best talent, at a reasonable price. Lets hope you get on with it and bring us some good signings ðŸ™‚
