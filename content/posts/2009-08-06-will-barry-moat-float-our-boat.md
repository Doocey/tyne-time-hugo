### Moat - Has reportedly bid Â£100m

The latest news coming for St.James' Park is that a local business tycoon has bid Â£100m for Newcastle United. This news comes as yesterdays article from The Times and The Chronicle claimed that local business tycoon  was ready to invest into the club. Moat is a luxury box-office holder at Newcastle and has been for some time now. The payment from which he renewed his season ticket, the money was used in the youth setup and invested in that area. That's quite surprising considering it's Ashley we're talking about here. There's been a flurry of activity around Newcastle but no end product at the end of it and it's more than likely that Mike Ashley will still be owner come the New Year.

Moat, who we don't know if he has bid yet or not, is meant to have foreign backing, supposedly from America and we'd hope it would be pretty serious backing too. If he's struggling to meet the Â£100m asking price then we can't see where he will get the money for important transfers and the huge wage bill. Today also brings us the news that Newcastle have accepted a bid from Tottenham for Sebastien Bassong. The bid is believed to be in the region of Â£10m but considering we rejected Â that amount only earlier that week something has changed or the fee is bigger than Â£10m. We'll just have to wait and see because that's all we can do. Newcastle's demise continues..
