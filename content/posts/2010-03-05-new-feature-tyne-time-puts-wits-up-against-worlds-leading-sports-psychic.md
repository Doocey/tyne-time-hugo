As Newcastle United's exciting season continues on the field, **Tyne Time** have teamed up with _Dean 'Midas' Maynard_, one the worlds most renowned psychics who has many successes to date. Dean and myself have agreed to have a little challenge to see who's predictions are most accurate for the remaining 13 Coca Cola Championship games. Obviously a lot of people will be skeptic of Dean's abilities and I must say I'm not really a man into this kind of stuff but nevertheless, it interests me. Our first bout in the 'Tipping Challenge' will commence tomorrow when Newcastle United take on Barnsley at St.James' Park.

The tipping challenge will put my footballing brain to the test while also presenting an opportunity for Dean 'Midas' Maynard to show off some of his ability. Dean, who has worked with the likes of XFactors' finest, Britain's Got Talent contestants, Dancing On Ice participants and even now, with the worlds famous Kevin Doocey.

Dean has also worked with Sunderland FC ( I know, I know), Luton Town, Colchester United and many other clubs, bringing his lucky charm to all of them too mind you.

Conveniently, Dean picked Newcastle United as his football club this year after picking and backing Stoke to stay up last season. That they did. Now we're grateful to have 'Midas' Maynard on our side and let's hope he can brings his good fortune to the Tyneside club, because we'll certainly need it.

More information on Dean Maynard can be obtained from his website.

Anyway, both myself and Dean have made our scoreline predictions for tomorrow's game and the points are as follows for the most accurate tipster.

**10pts =** _A 100% correct prediction (Exact winning team & scoreline)_

**5pts =** _Picking the correct winning team._

Very simple as you can see. With 13 games left, (I hope the fact we're starting on the number 13 doesn't have any bearing on Newcastle United's season!) we'll start at St.James' Park, at home to a good Barnsley side.

My predictions were done first and then Dean gave me his so there wasn't any changing of scorelines just to make it clear. It's pretty obvious that we're both expecting Newcastle to keep their free scoring home form going tomorrow. Lets hope we're right.

There you have it. Both predictions done, we'll just wait till 5pm to see who's right or indeed closest. If you're a gambling man, we don't advise picking these selections just purely based on Dean's psychic ability or my immaculate footballing brain. Do it on your own free will ðŸ˜€

Anyway, till then, Howay The Lads!
