### Lovenkrands - Limped off against Preston N.E but not out for too long we hope

Some people say it was the injuries that sent Newcastle United down to the Coca Cola Championship last year but this time around, we're hoping it's the lack of injuries that send us back up to the Premier League. The amount of injuries we had at one stage of the season couldn't be counted on two hands and that's never a good sign. Luckily this year, although we're in probably a more  physically demanding league, we've avoided major injuries, although Shola Ameobi & Steven Taylor have been absent a considerable amount of time.

Currently, we have Steven Taylor, Wayne Routledge, Peter Lovenkrands, Jose Enrique, Joey Barton and Shola Ameobi sidelined, but a few of them will be expected back for the Watford encounter, or the game after, at home to Barnsley.

Joey Barton is yet to return and although expected back in January, his recovery hit the rocks due to the heavy snowfalls in England during that time. Barton is a very good player no doubt and with him in CM alongside either Alan Smith, Danny Guthrie or Kevin Nolan, it'd be a very interesting midfield.

If we can manage to keep the lads fit and avoid any major injuries then we'll be far better off even though some people say Nicky Butt performs best when he's not on the field!

As i said, if we can keep the treatment room free then he strength and depth to this Newcastle United side will be prevalent throughout the remainder of the Coca Cola Championship season.
