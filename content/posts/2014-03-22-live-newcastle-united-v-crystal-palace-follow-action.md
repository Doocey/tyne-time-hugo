While Newcastle United's season may have ended two months ago, today they welcome Crystal Palace to St. James' Park with Tony Pulis' side in desperate need of three points as they battle relegation. A quick cast back to Newcastle United's season in the Championship will bring back memories of countless wins, including a double over Palace. Can you guess who scored in the last affair at SJP? A Shaun Derry O.G and a rare Nile Ranger goal: how times have changed. Some members of that NUFC squad remain in tact with Shola Ameobi and Fabricio Coloccini hoping to put in a shift against the Eagles this afternoon. Now, we know that sometimes its not possible to get to every Newcastle game, or indeed acquire  a visual of it so we here at

**Tyne Time** have decided to blog the entire event from start to finish.

Sit back, relax and watch the updates flow in right below this paragraph - you needn't even refresh the page!

We're going for a 2-0 Toon win, feel free to Tweet your Newcastle United v Crystal Palace thoughts [@TyneTime](https://twitter.com/tynetime "tyne time twitter") throughout the game. Enjoy.
