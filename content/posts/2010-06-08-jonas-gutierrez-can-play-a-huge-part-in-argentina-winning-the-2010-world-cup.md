#### Argentina - Tyne Time fancies the Argies to come very close to the trophy

We here at Tyne Time like an odd punt on football and we know that most of readers do too. One site, we seriously recommended for availing of the best betting offers are simply because they have what you need. A clean site that tells you where you need to go to get the best sign-up offers that you can. A lot of people when signing up to bookmakers just go straight to their site and do the basics. At bettingexpert.com you can get the very last penny from the bookmakers before you even place your first bet! We here at Tyne Time think that Argentina will come very close to winning the trophy if not getting their hands on it. What's more, a Toon player will be there in the shape of Jonas Gutierrez and we hope that he has an excellent tournament, as he will more than likely start in the majority of the games.

You may have noticed that we have promoted a few bookmakers over the last few weeks and we will continue to do so because the World Cup only comes around every four years and it's a very special occasion. More to the point, it's a big money making opportunity with big games nearly on every night.

At Bettingexpert.com you get a large range of quality, free and detailed betting tips which can often aid you make some money. The site holds a lot of high quality tipsters that are well in profit over a long period of time, which is something hard to achieve if you bet fairly often like a lot of us do.

If you fancy Argentina to lift the trophy then you can shop around and this site does the organising for you by filtering all the best odds into one small betting portal so to speak.

We hope Jonas does the Toon Army proud and we're confident he'll do his bit to help Lionel Messi, Kun Aguero and company ðŸ˜€
