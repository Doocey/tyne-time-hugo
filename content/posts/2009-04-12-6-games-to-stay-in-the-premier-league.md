### Sbragia - In a similar situation to Shearer

Well it's a pity we're here, our Premier League status hanging in the balance. Never in a long long time have we witnessed such a tight League as such and it's going to come right down the the wire for all clubs involved. It has been a very odd Premier League campaign from start to finish with so little breathing space for any team in it, we have suffered so much here at Newcastle from a poor ownership to poor performances. it would be a loss to not only us, the fans but to football if Newcastle United were to be relegated in May.

We have 6 games left, which we need to win 3 of or else we can count ourselves to playing Championship football. We look at Fulham, they survived on the last day and look at them now, comfortably mid table. That could've have been us if we have one constant manager and an ownership who took more responsibility. I can only hope we stay up and can enjoy a comfortable following season. If we go down it isn't Shearer's fault. It's Mike Ashley's, simple as that. They have learned at this stage but it could be too late. Martins, Michael Owen, Sebastien Bassong, Jonas Gutierrez, Damien Duff, Steve Harper, Steven Taylor, Jose Enrique, Habib Beye, Kevin Nolan, Mark Viduka, Nicky Butt, Joey Barton, Alan Smith, Danny Guthrie, Ryan Taylor, do these sound like Coca Cola Championship players? No these are Premier League players and if relegation comes you can expect most of these to be on their way out of Toon.

Hopefully it won't come to this and that Big Al can produce some results. We;re all relying on the three home games to Pompey, Boro and Fulham but other teams have home games when we play Spurs next. Boro could well skip free of trouble if they beat Fulham next at the Riverside whilst Sunderland could make a big step to safety if they beat Hull at the Stadium Of Light. Our future remains in the balance, in the hands of the man above and in the players. We can stay up and we have to although it will come right down to the wire. Let's hope we come out on top.
