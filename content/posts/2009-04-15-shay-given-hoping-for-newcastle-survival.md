### Given - Praying for Newcastle's safety

We all miss Shay Given between the sticks at St.James' but it was time for him to go and to try get some success with another club. Shay is without a doubt one of the best keepers in the world and saved NUFC on so many occasions. He left at the right time, when Newcastle were about hit the toughest period in a long long time. Saying that, he's still a big fan of Newcastle and who wouldn't after being with the club for 11 years. Speaking today he said he all his faith in Shearer to save Newcastle from dreaded relegation, we're right behind you Shay.

Given said :

> “He should have been brought in earlier to try and get some results,”
>
> “It would be a real tragedy if they got relegated but it is getting very close to the wire.
>
> “The games are running out and the results are not going so well.
>
> “Please God Alan can keep them up and they can start to invest more in the team and have a stronger squad.”

When asked about his memories of Newcastle he said he will never forget them and their mighty fans.

> “It is not easy to divorce myself from Newcastle,”
>
> “The last thing I want is to see them get relegated because they have such fantastic supporters.
>
> “I spoke to Alan and dropped him a few texts wishing him luck. If anyone can have an effect and galvanise the club it is him.”

Next up for us are Spurs, a team that were expected to be in the hunt for Shay. We can only hope , alongside Given, for all three points on Sunday.

Comments appreciated 🙂
