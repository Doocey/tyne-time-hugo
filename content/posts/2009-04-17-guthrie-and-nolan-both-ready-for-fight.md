### Guthrie - Ready to beat the drop alongside Nolan

Danny Guthrie today, in preparation for the Spurs game on Sunday says he's ready to fight at White Hart Lane and indeed everywhere else they go this season. He thinks that Kevin Nolan can help guide us out of the danger zone with his experience. Guthrie played with Nolan at Bolton and they both know each other's game. Maybe both should start in center mid on Sunday and perhaps Nicky Butt just behind them. What a great three points it would be to take from White Hart Lane, we've done it before on numerous occasions and Guthrie believes they can do it again.

He said :

> 'Kevin is going to bring us experience.
>
> “He’s been in this situation before with Bolton, and he’s an experienced player.
>
> “We’re going to need his character and presence in the dressing room and on the pitch. Me and Kev got on really well last year, and it was good to see him come here.”

He also commented on Nicky Butt's vast experience and that he too can contribute massively to the fight on their hands.

> “We’re going to need all the bodies we can to stay up, and the more experience we can add to the team the better, and that’s what we’ve got with Kev and Nicky.”
>
> “The competition in the middle is good. I know I’m not just walking back into the team – I have to push myself hard and prove myself all over again to get in the team.”

It's good to hear that Danny is going to fight for his place in the team and that;s exactly what we need until the end of the season, fighters.

Comments appreciated 🙂
