###Â Wilshere - Linked with Newcastle loan move in January

The rumour mill is dusting off it's hinges and getting going again. Of course you could say it never stops at Newcastle above any other club. Today reports bring the story that Arsenal starlet Jack Wilshere will possibly make a loan switch to Newcastle United in the forthcoming January transfer window. This news comes as Arsene Wenger declared that Wilshere is available for loan  and may indeed join a 'top Championship club' and somehow I don't think he means Ipswich Town. (Sorry Town Fans). Anyway, of course it might not be us, it could well be West Bromwich Albion, QPR, Leicester, Boro or indeed Swansea City, we don't know for sure.

However, we'd certainly hope that Chris Hughton is in the hunt for him because we've all seen what little Jack can do when he gets on the ball. Wilshere is highly rated in Arsenal and indeed throughout England so it wouldn't surprise me if a Premier League team made an approach for him.

Speaking today, Hughton said :

> â€œThere are quality players out there â€“ thatâ€™s what we have available to us.
>
> â€œFor us, itâ€™s about getting what we need in the transfer window. But we also know, after that, weâ€™re also able to bring in players on loan.
>
> â€œWeâ€™ve got to be very, very open to that.
>
> â€œAt the moment, itâ€™s quite a tight squad.

Either way, we need players and Wilshere would be a very good addition indeed. Especially on the wing where a lot of goals can be created from. Not saying Jonas Gutierrez isn't doing his job but adding a young blood like Jack could do the whole team a world of good.

We'll just have to see as usual though, but in honesty, we need two or three new signings in January if we want to be in the hierarchy of the Championship teams never mind winning it.
