### Beckford - Seems pretty happy about joining Newcastle eh?

News has just broke that Jermaine Beckford is joining Newcastle United. In possibly the shortest interview I've even read, Beckford simply said he would be joining Newcastle United and nothing else. It was a Tyne Time viewer who spotted this a few minutes ago and I in return am writing about what should be our first signing of the January transfer window. Neither Leeds  United or Newcastle United have confirmed that this is true but you don't have to be a genius to work out it's the truth (or we think so). It seems the long debacle over who he'd be joining is over, or so it appears anyway.

Speaking to GOAL, he said :

> _'I'm off to Newcastle,' though refusing to comment further._

So it seems as if he'll be upfront for us in the very near future and tomorrow may well see him do a medical on Tyneside. The fee is still unknown but it's rumored to be Â£2m or just a little bit more.

More to follow, and maybe even a few more lines from our apparent new signing ðŸ˜€
