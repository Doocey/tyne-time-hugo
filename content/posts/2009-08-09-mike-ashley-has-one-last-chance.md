###Â Ashley - Coming back from holiday

Mike Ashley, the torrid owner of Newcastle United, has one last chance to get out of the club before it's too late, yet again. It's being reported today that Ashley is flying back from Hawaii , cutting short an  undeserved holiday to return and discuss Barry Moat's bid. It's believed Moat has bid around Â£70m and Ashley isn't too keen on accepting it, only thing is, it's the only bidder let on the table with the Profitable Group having pulled out a while back. Although it's being reported that David O'Leary has been offered the Newcastle job, with Ashley deciding to stay, we can't trust any Sunday rumours from any source, this time being the BBC.

We certainly hope Ashley does not decide to cut his losses and stay as owner because that would be disastrous for Newcastle United, to say the least. It';s been an awful couple of years for the club but there was a glimmer of hope yesterday when the lads snatched a point away to West Brom. We might just have a chance in this league, we definitely will, with Shearer and new players, if that happens. Most players in the Championship would be willing to join Newcastle as soon as the mess is sorted, or maybe even join in the current state. Newcastle are the only club in England to have not signed a player this season and that needs to change. Will we ever get a new owner? The next week will tell us, we hope.
