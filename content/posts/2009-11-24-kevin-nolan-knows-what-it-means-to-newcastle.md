Yesterday Newcastle again fought their way to a victory in rather undesirable conditions, in Deepdale. Kevin Nolan turned in his 9th goal of the season and again leads the scoring charts. From the first whistle, it was a game that could go either way but the further the game progressed, you just felt that a goal was coming for the Toon. Indeed it did come, and it quite a tasty goal to say the least. Nolan swivelled before swerving it beyond Preston's #1. To be fair to Preston, I can only recount two chances in the whole match where they could've scored, Neil Mellor's 1 on 1 against Kadar and Eddie Nolan attempt straight at Harper.

Saying that, it could've been one of those games where Preston stole it at the death but luckily with fifteen minutes to go, Nolan grabbed what proved to be the only goal in the game.

His celebration said it all, and he knew what a win away at Preston meant to the travelling Toon fans. They were there in an abundance and again showed why Newcastle United is such a special club.

After a poor first season in one which ended up with us being relegated, Kevin Nolan has really turned things around, but then again you'd expect that when he's playing in a division lower than expected.

Jonas was up to his usual tricks and missed a chance at the death, ballooning it high into the travelling Geordies but it didn't matter as Newcastle grabbed another clean sheet and another precious win.

These are the wins that will prove vital come May, and as I said in yesterdays article, we might look back at the Preston game in 2010, when hopefully, we'll be nearing a return to the top flight.
