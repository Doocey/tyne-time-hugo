### Coloccini - Mike Williamson grateful of the Argentine's help and experience

It's true to say Fabricio Coloccini has been a rock at the central of defence this season at Newcastle United and really, he'd want to be putting in a good shift after setting us back Â£10.3m in the 'Keegan Summer'. Another centre-back who arrived on Tyneside this January by the name of Mike Williamson from troubled Portsmouth has also been sturdy at the heart of our defence, a position  where we've lacked real quality throughout the years. It's good to see a positive spirit running through the Newcastle United camp and indeed others helping others.

Speaking today, William said :

> _'It's been a pleasure to play with Colo these last few games - he's a real top-quality player.'We have got a good understanding already and we are unbeaten in the games we have played together.</p>
>
> 'He's made it very easy for me coming into a new club and I'm enjoying playing alongside him.
>
> 'Hopefully we will get a good run because our understanding will only get better.'_

The big question many Toon fans asked was whether Williamson will endure a large part of the season the bench when Steven Taylor returns from injury but Chris Hughton is adamant that the players who are performing in training, will play in competitive matches and right he is.

Questions remain over both Taylor & Coloccini's futures in the summer but we'll take it one step at a time, with Barnsley at home our most important next step.

We like the look of Mike Williamson in a Black & White shirt and he seems really up to the cause, then again who wouldn't be happy to leave Portsmouth with only one game under your belt and their current financial condition meaning that you might not have a future at the club.

Whether Williamson will be ready for the Premier League or indeed whether we'll get there is another arguement but with his height I'm sure he can prove a nuisance from corners and too, stopping opposition players in the air.

The main thing that I hope we help ourselves to is the 3 points on Saturday at St.James' Park because we can't afford any clip-ups at this stage of the season.

Also, **Tyne Time** will be launching a new feature tomorrow ahead of the game at Barnsley and we think you might just be interested.
