### Derby - Have a very good record against Newcastle United in the last five years

I think it's fair to say we all remember our encounters with Derby County in the last 5 years. Especially our games against the Rams under Sam Allardyce which saw us go to Pride Park on a cold Monday night and get beaten 1-0 thanks to a Kenny Miller wondergoal and then their trip to St.James' Park saw us have to come from behind twice and snatch a point, with a certain Mark  Viduka to thank above all people. Those weren't very good times and since then, there has been an abundance of changes at the club, some good some bad. This year, under Chris Hughton, we ended the year with a 0-0 draw against Nigel Clough's team at St.James' with us not able to find a way past Steven Bywater, even the woodwork aided Derby's cause, keeping Nile Ranger's last minute attempt out.

In other words, Derby County always seem to put up a good performance against us every time and even though The Rams have been in pretty poor form this season, they do have a habit of playing well against the big teams, beating their rivals Nottingham Forest recently which could prove a big win for both Derby and indeed Newcastle.

Robbie Savage is always up for a game like this and will relish the challenge of putting his wits up against Newcastle's central-midfield pairing. Savage himself scored a stunner of a goal in their last match, smashing home a 25 yard drive.

I certainly hope that we get a win against Derby in this upcoming fixture because we really do need it. Every game is a must win for Newcastle from now until May. If we can play like we did against Cardiff City on Friday night then we might just overcome and put to bed, Derby's fine record against us of late.

With Forest and West Brom looking as if they won't be slipping up anytime soon, we must ensure that we ourselves don't let any points drop. I'm certain that West Brom and Nottingham Forest will indeed drop points in upcoming games but we can't think like that and must go out to win every game .

If we can then we'll have no complaints. Hopefully now that Kenny Miller isn't in the side to pelt home any long-range strikes, Robbie Savage won't carry on the tradition but per usual, we'll just have to see ðŸ˜€
