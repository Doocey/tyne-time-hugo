### Kinnear - Missed out on a couple of targets, again

Yet again, another window passes by with us capturing next to nothing, numbers wise. Ryan Taylor, Peter Lovenkrands and Kevin Nolan all January signings but we missed out on another couple of targets last night, one of them, Manchester City's Michael Johnston. Conflicting reports are floating around but Joe Kinnear admitted Man City had indeed rejected the bid which is an absolute disgrace on City part, considering we sold them the Premier League's best keeper Shay Given, only the day before.

We needed numbers alright and what we have brought in and sold out are not far off. In other words we've brought in one player after selling two. Good news today is that indeed Obafemi Martins is fit for the West Brom game, along with Viduka and Alan Smith, it is a timely boost for these experienced battlers to return in a vital part of the season. They will all play a vital role in anchoring us in the premier League for the following season. Viduka will get some goals and Smith will battle on regardless. Obafemi will do what he does best, score gear goals and turn a game on its head. Welcome back lads ðŸ™‚

West Brom up next, three points needed. Howay the lads!
