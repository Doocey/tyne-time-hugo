It has been over four years since I last wrote a post on here. It marked the the departure of [Rafa Benitez as Newcastle United manager](https://www.tynetime.com/2019/06/thank-you-rafa/). The club was a sad state of affairs, bereft of direction, derelect by owner.

Fast forward over 1500 days and Newcastle United are preparing to line out against European giants AC Milan in a **UEFA Champions League** affair. After an incredible Premier League campaign, Eddie Howe has guided a determined bunch of stalwarts to the top tier competition in the world, and tonight it all kicks-off in the twilight of the city of Milan.

Unbelievable scenes in truth. 23 years later, to hear that Champions League anthem with the lads lining out in Black and White. Sir Bobby would be proud. Special.

Soak it in, enjoy it - these are the occasions every Newcastle fan has dreamed of. From writing about relegation in 2009 & 2016 to now willing a Champions League group stage win in 2023,
