###Â Ashley - Going to put another Â£20m into the club quickly

The worst news possible has come today with owner Mike Ashley confirming he has taken the club off the market and has appointed Chris Hughton as permanent manager on an 18-month contract. This isn't surprising news but devastating all the same. To cap it all, Ashley claims to invest Â£20m immediately and bring the club forward. Not the first time we've heard this and it's  sure to cause uproar amongst the Toon faithful.

It said :

> 'We are delighted that Chris has accepted the post of full time manager. He has done a terrific job this season and we wish him every success for the rest of this season and beyond. He will continue to receive our full backing and support.'
>
> And Chris Hughton added:
>
> 'It is a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club. I thank Mike and Derek for their support and will be doing everything in my power to get the Club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking.
>
> 'Having the unequivocal backing of the players has helped me enormously and I would also like to thank Colin Calderwood, Paul Barron and the rest of the backroom staff who have never been anything but tremendously supportive to me this season.'

And then :

> In confirming the news, Mike Ashley stated that he is totally committed to the future success of Newcastle United and will be focussing on gaining promotion back to the Premier League. Mike will put a further Â£20m into the Club this week.
>
> Whilst confirming these two matters, Newcastle United now aims to move forward on and off the pitch. The Club aims to maximise its commercial revenues; this includes renegotiating its Club sponsor and kit deal, which expire at the end of this season, as well as welcoming offers for the stadium naming rights for next season.

This is what we've been fed already and it's not going work again. Where next for NUFC?
