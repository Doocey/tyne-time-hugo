#### Christmas - Enjoy what's been a good year for Alan Pardew and Newcastle Utd

The season so far has been quite aÂ surprisinglyÂ successful one. Newcastle United lay comfortably in the top half of the Premier League and on course for this campaigns expectations. We've had some memorable results including the win away at Sunderland, our thrashing of Stoke City away from home, and indeed we even went unbeaten in the Premier League for a record amount of games.

The performances from the players this season have been inspiring, some individuals in particular.

However, today isn't about discussing the form of our players or the results we've achieved - it's about celebrating Christmas wherever you may be, and whoever you may be with.

I personally would like to wish Newcastle United fans across the world, from England to Singapore, a very Happy Christmas and an enjoyable few days. This site would be nothing without you!

Put the feet up, and get ready for Boxing Day where we'll be looking to get back on track ðŸ˜€
