Newcastle United have missed out on the chance of grabbing two strikers after the duo completed loan moves other Championship teams. James Vaughan, Everton's striker join Derby County on loan whilst Irishman and Hull hitman, Caleb Folan completed his much awaited move to Middlesbrough. Both were targets of Newcastle, as confirmed by Chris himself and it's  quite disappointing to lose out, especially on James Vaughan who could've been excellent for us this season as we hope for a immediate return to the Premier League.

Derby County, managed by Nigel Clough snapped up the pacey striker ahead of Chris Hughton, although it's still unknown whether Chris made an offer on behalf of NUFC.

Caleb Folan also completed a loan move to rivals 'Boro and I'm sure he'll grab more than his share of goals at the Riverside. 'Boro, who slumped to a shocking five-nil defeat at the hands of West Brom are just below Newcastle in the league, as it stands.

If Newcastle, West Brom and indeed Middlesbrough keep up their form of late, then there's the strong possibility that all three teams, which were relegated from the Premier League in May, could make an immediate return.

I'm not too worried about West Brom or Middlesbrough, because all concentration is on getting results for NUFC and it's brilliant fans. With a few new signings, hopefully a striker, then we could stand a chance of getting to Christmas without any serious injuries. Touch wood.
