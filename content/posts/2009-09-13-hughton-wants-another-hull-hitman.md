### Cousin - Wouldn't be a bad acquisition

After the news of Caleb Folan's reported loan move to Newcastle United, there is more news today, that Newcastle are looking for Daniel Cousin as well. The forward who is very similar to Caleb Folan hasn't been in and out of the Hull City side and it seems his relationship with manager Phil Brown isn't a love affair by any means. Most of you will remember cousin scoring against us in the  cup, which put us out last year but that was then and half the team that played that night no longer wear the Black and White of Newcastle United.

Speaking today Phil Brown said :

> “There’s been an enquiry for Caleb from Middlesbrough and also an enquiry from Newcastle._
>
> “We’ve also had an enquiry for Daniel Cousin from Newcastle.</p>
>
> “I heard a sound byte on the radio from Daniel Cousin saying ‘I have no problem with Phil Brown’.
>
> “Well, if you do have a problem, there’s only one answer, you move on.”
>
> I think the second part of his comment sums up the bond between the towering forward and the infamous boss, but if we manage to secure either Folan or Cousin, or indeed both, we won't be doing too badly at all.
>
> However, do we really need two, tall, robust centre forwards to add to Shola Ameobi and Nile Ranger? After all they may only be 1-month loan deals so it wouldn't be the end of the world either. Both of the lads, I'm sure, would try their hardest and grab a few goals as well. I suppose any new players at this stage is a bonus.
