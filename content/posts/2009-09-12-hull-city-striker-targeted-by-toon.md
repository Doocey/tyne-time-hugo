### Folan - Would be a good signing

News about the proposed move for Caleb Folan to either Middlesbrough or Newcastle has continued as it seems that the Irishman will chose one of the North East sides and seal a loan move. Folan, who plays for Ireland internationally, on a regular basis, has found himself on the fringe at Hull City which is quite surprising considering the very thing the lack is  goals. Folan who you can give a lot of credit to for Ireland's draw with Italy and win at Cyprus is being allowed out on loan and if rumours are true that he's about to join Newcastle then I'd be a very happy man indeed.

Phil Brown seems that he is placing most his hope on, on loan striker Jozy Altidore and new signing Stephen Hunt to secure safety but if their recent form this season is anything to go by then there's only one place they're going and that's back to the Coca Cola Championship. Some neutrals have said that they deserved to be relegated last year and that Newcastle should've stayed up, is all well and good but Hull really do seem to be destined for a nervy finish this season too, that is if they aren't in serious trouble by Christmas.

Portsmouth haven't started the season too well either and are rock bottom with their new owner looking to cut costs and high earners from the wage bill (sound familiar?). However, with Jermain Defoe, Sulley Muntari, Lassana Diarra, Peter Crouch and Glen Johnson all departed they are Newcastle United, just on a bigger scale.

If we do manage to recruit Folan, we'd be guaranteed a huge work rate and a few goals too. This lad is very capable and if he lines out in the Black and White of the Toon then I won't be complaining.
