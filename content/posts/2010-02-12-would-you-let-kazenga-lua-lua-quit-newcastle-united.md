### Kazenga - Needs regular playing time but not getting it at Newcastle United

20 years of age and has played 4 times for Newcastle United seniors and the supposed brother of Newcastle United former, Lomano Lua Lua. That would be Kazenga Lua Lua, the Congolese winger who hasn't made a real breakthrough at the Toon for the last couple of years. Today he joined Brighton & Hove Albion on loan for an initial 1 month. Lua Lua is highly rated on Tyneside but  has failed to jump the queue ahead of Jonas Gutierrez, Wayne Routledge etc and the youngster says he will sacrifice his Newcastle United dream to play regular first team football.

Dennis Wise conveniently enough recommended the young winger to Gus Poyet and the former Spurs assistant obliged to take the 20-year old on, hoping to get good use out of Lua Lua, who is cousin to Leeds United's Tresor Kandol.

Lua Lua today said :

> _“I don’t really know about my future there._
>
> _“After this season I’ve got one more year._
>
> _“I have been playing for Newcastle’s reserves for about five years now and I don’t want to keep playing for the reserves, so maybe in the summer it will be time for me to move.”_
>
> _“We’ll see what happens. I have come here for a month and I will try to do my best in that time._
>
> _“If the manager would then like me to stay I’ll have no problem with that. I have come here to enjoy it, play more and help the team get more points._

On the topic of Newcastle United and the current situation on Tyneside, he commented :

> _“It has been disappointing at Newcastle, because at the start of the season I was playing and coming on as a sub._
>
> _“Then, when I injured my ankle and groin, that was at a time when some of the other young players were pushing for a place, so it hasn’t been a good season for me.”_

It's obvious to see that he wants regular action on the pitch and quite frankly, he's not going to get it, unless injuries plague us again, or we've the league wrapped up nice and early. Somehow I think the first option might be a little more realistic.

Either way, what do you think? Should Lua-Lua be given a right go in the team? There's no doubting the lads talent but whether he has the motivation or patience to wait for his chance, only time will tell. At least now at Brighton, he'll be given a chance to show what he can do, to both Poyet and indeed Chris Hughton.

Comments welcome 🙂
