### Beckford - Staying at Leeds until the end of the season to help promotion bid

There's a lot of disappointed Newcastle United fans out there today at the news Leeds United's Jermaine Beckford will remain at Leeds United and try aid their promotion charge. A two nil away loss to Exeter City yesterday I'm sure played a certain part in his decision and there's no doubt Leeds do really need the the striker. I for one, didn't really get too excited about the proposed  arrival of Jermaine Beckford because I've seen him play, and a know a bit about him, not all too complimentary. There's no doubt the lad has talent and could probably cut it in the Championship, but I wouldn't bring him to the Premier League.

He today withdrew his transfer request and whether he actually had the chance to join Newcastle really is unknown. According to reports all three of our bids were rejected by the Elland Road outfit, and there wasn't many signs of other teams looking for his services.

Credit to Simon Grayson for keeping the striker at Leeds until the end of the season but if I was him, then I would've certainly let him go for anywhere on the Â£2m mark. Jermaine will more than likely walk in the summer for free unless Leeds can convince him to sign a new contract.

I'm sure you all have different opinions but I'm quite satisfied that the 26 year-old hasn't arrived on Tyneside. He has a past of controversial incidents and we really don't need them kind of players at Newcastle. Now I'm sure he would've been alright at Newcastle but we'll never know.

The thing is now, who's next for Chris Hughton? I wouldn't bank on us signing any new faces permanently this January, and we will more than likely see Marlon Harewood come back to St.James' Park on loan until the summer. I can't wait ðŸ˜€
