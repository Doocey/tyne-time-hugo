###Â Bassong - Deserves to stay up

Sebastien Bassong who has been our best player throughout the season still thinks Newcastle can beat the drop and propel themselves to safety. Arriving from France for as little as 3/4's of a million, Sebastien has aspired to Newcastle's best center back this season, if not one of the best center backs in the Premier League. Perhaps I'm a little too biased! However he's been a brilliant figure this season and will get snapped up if we go down, which seems more and more likely.

Speaking today Bassong said :

> 'Honestly, I have enjoyed the season because it is my first in England and the Premier League is the best championship,'
>
> 'But the situation of Newcastle makes me a little sad because I don't want to help them go down in my first season, so I will try to help my team stay up.'

Asked on his future if the Toon go down or not, Bassong replied :

> 'I am not thinking about my future. The most important thing is staying up.
>
> 'We will think about my future at the end of the season - hopefully after we have stayed up.'

We really hope that the lads pick up 2 more wins but I really can't see that happening. Stranger things have happened though.
