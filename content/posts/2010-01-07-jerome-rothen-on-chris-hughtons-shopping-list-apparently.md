Sky Sports are reporting within the last hour that Chris Hughton may well make a move for PSG's Jérôme Rothen. The winger, who is on loan at Rangers is meant to have caught the eye of Hughton in the last while. Speaking earlier today Hughton, who has been in good contact with the media, said he is very confident that his transfer targets will arrive this January, and maybe  sooner than later. With Beckford expected to arrive very soon indeed there are still lingering reports that Matthew Kilgallon could make a move to us yet.

The reports of Jérôme Rothen's interest comes from the French newspaper Le Quotidien du Foot. Rothen has failed to make an impression at Ibrox of late and has been sent back home with suspicion of having the swine flu.

Rothen is 31 years of age and has been around quite a while. He's a French international and was certainly a handful back in the day. Whether he's still able to cut it, remains to be seen.

Some people are beginning to get a little worried about Hughton's ambitions to sign older players, and in their 30's but nothing so far has suggested that Hughton isn't willing to buy younger players.

The likes of Matthew Kilgallon & Jermaine Beckford are young but no kids to be fair. They're both moving into their later 20's. If they can do a job for Newcastle United FC then by all means bring them on board. However, that's the very question many people are asking, can they improve our side that already holds many Premier League players?

I'm sure more news will follow about this rumour as the January transfer window begins to hot up, or something like that.

Comments welcome 🙂
