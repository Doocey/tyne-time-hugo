### Shearer - More concerned about beating teams around us

When we lose to Chelsea 2-0 at St.James' Park you'd expect a normal day. However this day with a new manager and 8 games left to save their season was something different. Something big was expected. However what we expected didn't come, it wasn't a huge atmosphere or any great ordeal, why? because we have to beat the teams around us and the like of Stoke, Spurs, Boro and Pompey are more important games. Most of us knew we wouldn't win but we expected a more determined performance, we didn't get going today but that'll be excused.

Shearer was unveiled today and got a brilliant reception, it was funny and nice to hear the chants of 'Shearer, Shearer' echoing around the stadium even when we conceded. Most of us know he needs a little time and that, that was a Chris Hughton side playing against Chelsea today. Hopefully with Stoke next week we can pick up the pieces and get a result, one thing is for sure, we need to, and soon. We have three winnable games at home coming up and hopefully, hopefully we'll grab enough points to stay up as time is running out. 3 points off safety and up next a team who are performing well. Come on lads,Â  save this mighty club and it's brilliant fans.
