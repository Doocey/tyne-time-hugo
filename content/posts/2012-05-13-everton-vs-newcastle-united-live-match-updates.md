#### Goodison - NUFC could well secure a Champions League spot in Merseyside

We're aware that not everyone has a visual of today's game so TyneTime will be providing live text updates by the minute from Goodison Park. Only three years ago, we were hoping for a result away to Aston Villa to stay in the Premier League. As the lads prepare to take on Everton, they know that if they secure all three points - they could finish 3rd, or 4th depending on other results. It is a remarkable achievement and would be a very fitting end to the season if we finished in the  top three and manage to guarantee the brilliant fans definite Champions League action.

At 5 o'clock today, we'll know who has been relegated, who has won the Premier League and what teams will make up the Top 4. What a final day we're in store for. Luckily for you as readers, I'll be keeping you updated with the important scores today ie., Arsenal away at West Brom, Tottenham at home to Fulham. Stay tuned, and enjoy!
