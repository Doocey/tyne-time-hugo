### Hutton - Supposedly has held talks with Newcastle already

Before I start about the Hutton story, need I bring up the whole thing about West Brom scoring late since the start of the season? Another goal, in the 96th minute, denying Watford a huge victory. What's more, I've lost count of how many times they've scored in the last five minutes, it's certainly double figures. Anyway, the latest news surrounding Newcastle besides the big  matter of a Premier League spot being officially secured tonight, is of our reported interest in Tottenham's Alan Hutton.

Speaking after Spurs loss to Sunderland, when on the matter of Hutton, Redknapp commented :

> _“I think you will find Newcastle are in for him as well,” “Someone has told me he has been talking to Newcastle. He is not supposed to be, but he has, you know. We will only let him go if we get an awful lot of money for him, otherwise he comes back to Tottenham.”_

Now, we'd hardly expect Chris Hughton to be speaking to him behind the clubs back but I could certainly see Colin Caldewood holding a few talks with the Scottish fullback.

With Danny Simpson at the club, a lot are questioning whether the former Manchester United RB is capable of sticking it out in the Premier League but I'm sure he'll get a chance to prove himself. Hutton would be a far more experienced than Simpson but whether he'd be any good is another thing. He certainly has talent and has been pretty decent for Sunderland of late, it'd be sweet if we beat Steve Bruce's side to the former Rangers man 😀

It's good to see Hughton is making plans for our targets already and I don't expect there'll be any last-day signings, or indeed panic signings like his predecessors.

A win tonight and Hughton can put them plans into action. Premier League here we come.

Comments welcome 🙂
