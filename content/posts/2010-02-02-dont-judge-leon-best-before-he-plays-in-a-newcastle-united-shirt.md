### Best - Some Toon fans concerned at the signing of Leon by Chris Hughton

It seems if a lot of Newcastle United fans have already formed opinions on our new signing, Irish international Leon Best. Having watched Best on many occasions, although he's no Alan Shearer he certainly has the potential as Hughton rightly said, to make a good striker. Signing from Coventry for a rumoured fee of 650k, Best was Newcastle's deadline day signing , getting in a striker after missing our on Victor Moses. Indeed I believe the Victor Moses scenario has played a huge part in some fans negative attitude to Best, even though he hasn't graced the pitch in a Black & White jersey yet.

What I am saying, is give Leon Best a chance at Newcastle United. He is determined to do well for the club and more importantly, is honoured to pull on the Toon jersey, and there's been a lack of players with the same attitude as Leon, in the last couple of years.

Having scored 10 goals at Coventry City already this season, in what's been an in and out season for the Sky Blues, Best has been performing well. He's quite good at headering the ball and if anyone saw his goal against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, you'll know he can finish give half a chance.

Best is a different player to our usual Andy Carroll, Shola Ameobi and Nile Ranger, he's quite pacy and hopefully, will cause some problems to Cardiff's defence in the upcoming titanic clash at St.James' Park.

Time will tell, but for just over half a million if even, Best is worth a shot and if he's even a third of the player that namesake George Best is, then we have a right gem on our hands. Somehow I don't think he'll be that good!

I must say I'm not a fan of YouTube compilations as they're no way to judge a player, (as Dennis Wise found out) but, I do advise you take a look at Leon Best's goal v Portsmouth in the FA Cup Â only a few weeks back.
