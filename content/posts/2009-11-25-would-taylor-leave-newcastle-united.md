Reports are emerging of late that David Moyes is looking yet again, at Newcastle's prominent centre back, Steven Taylor. Moyes, who was present at the Preston North End game on Monday has been after Taylor for many a season now if reports are to believed. Now it seems, with Moyes huge injury problems (sound familiar?) is looking to bolster his squad, and especially his defence. That's all good and well, but the real question remains, will Stevie Taylor himself leave the club, or indeed be allowed to? Personally I don't think Mike would have any problem in accepting a suitable bid for the Newcastle born defender.

Some reports say that it was Fabricio Coloccini that David Moyes was compiling a report on but somehow, I find that very hard to believe. It's no the first time Taylor's been linked to Everton and I'm sure it won't be the last either.

What do you think? Would Taylor opt to leave Newcastle? He's already said earlier this year that it broke his heart to think he might be forced out of the club he supported as a boy and loves, however, as you know, footballer's feelings often change, and to the sound of money.

Saying that I personally think he won't leave for Everton, even if they do make a bid and it's accepted. Who's the say Mike will even consider it as well?With his club on top of the Championship entering Christmas and things seemingly sorted behind closed doors, what else could the CB want?
