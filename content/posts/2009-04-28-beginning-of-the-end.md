### Newcastle - Relegation looms

We all hoped for a victory yesterday and what did we get? A point, a pretty useless one at that. We needed all 3 without a doubt butÂ  dreadfully poor finishing from Michael Owen and Obafemi Martins couldn't nab us that goal we needed. We didn't start with that spark that was needed, or that bite that was required. We did however push fairly high up and for the majority of the half, there was only one team playing and that was Newcastle. Just as you'd expect, injury struck, to JosÃ© Enrique who was just back from the treatment table too. Same old story from then on.

We could've won the game, with Viduka nearly stabbing one home in the first half, however he got caught in two minds whether to stab it in, or take control of it. Mind you Viduka had another chance but it was straight at the keeper, who looked dodgy all night. Duff had a shot saved, Owen missed an absolute sitter that I would've expect Ameobi to have scored but that's our luck all season, none. You might say we did get lucky when Richard Hughes hit the post in the dying minutes but well in truly, should we have taken our chances last night we wouldn't of had to worry even if Hughes did score.

I've been a very realistic and optimistic supporter of Newcastle all my life but I think we've all grown to be pessimistic with the team. I honestly think that we are on the way down and will be playing Championship football next year. It's sad to see this happen to such a great club and the great great fans. It's Mike Ashley's fault, no excuses, he is the reason why we are here and why we could well be heading down the the second tier of English football. Although not fully relegated yet, realistically, we would need Hull to lose every game from now until the end of the season and for ourselves to pick up 2 wins. Fulham, Boro? I wouldn't suspect so. It wouldn't be far off a miracle if we stayed up.
