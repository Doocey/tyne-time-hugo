### Guthrie - Has a bright future under Newcastle United

They say he was Kevin Keegan's only signing for Â£2m. He arrived from Liverpool after conceding he couldn't break the first team or compete with the 'brilliance' of Steven Gerrard. Well after arriving from Anfield Guthrie had a mixed start on Tyneside, he broke Craig Fagan's leg before scoring a scorcher against Portsmouth in a memorable victory.Since then, there's be little in  the way of media interaction with Danny Guthrie. He keeps his head low and doesn't complain whether he's starting or not. If I'm honest, he's one of my favourite Newcastle players simply because he seems a good lad with a good future in front of him.

He's been speaking about the current morale in the Toon camp :

> _'I have never been involved in anything like last year but everything you go through, even bad things, makes you stronger._
>
> _'It was horrible and I am trying to put it behind me._
>
> _'We're doing a pretty good job of that even though nothing gets won in the first half of the season._
>
> _'So the next few months are massive.__

>_  _'We are a lot more settled and everyone is pulling in the same direction. Managerial stability means we can get on with playing, while we are going out there to win every game.'__

>_  _'It's a different club from the one I joined, particularly in the dressing room where we are all so together._
>
> _'It is a really strong dressing room now and only the right players should be brought in_
>
> _'They must have the right mentality and attitude. Anyone who comes in will have to become part of that spirit._
>
> _'I cannot stress enough how we are all working so well together. We all want the same thing and every week everyone goes out and plays for each other._

This is good to see, especially the fact that there is a feel good factor throughout the Newcastle United team. It's been a long time since the squad were happy playing, training and working together. The Bobby Robson Era comes to mind.

Guthrie, for me can become an excellent midfielder if he keeps on the right road. We have already seen glimpses of the former midfielder and his serious potential. His goal against Leicester at St.James' Park springs to mind.

Needless to say there will be teams after Danny at some stage this month or if not, in the the summer. He's got a good future ahead of him and the right attitude to go with it. The makings of a very good midfielder.
