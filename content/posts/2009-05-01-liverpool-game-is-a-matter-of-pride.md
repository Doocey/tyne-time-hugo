###Â Players - Need to show they're worth their wages

We'll be going to Liverpool very soon and we'll be looking for a point. Shearer has today said that the team are going there with the attitude that we can get all 3 points but in fairness that won't happen. It's good to see the lads are optimistic heading into one of the highest scoring teams in the league but if you do the maths, we won't be getting anything from this game. We have big trouble defending and our defending is way below par, for Liverpool, they've found it easy to score and their defense has been sufficient. You'd suspect a big scoreline come the afternoon.

For me, I have remained optimistic all year and throughout the bad times, I said if we got a win against Pompey we could well get ourselves out of trouble but I don't think it will happen now. I believe we are destined to be a Championship team come the end of May. I really hope that I'm proved wrong because we don't deserve to go down with such support. Certainly the best in the Premier League if not all of Europe. It would be a great tragedy if we went down with question. Alan Shearer is the man to lead us out but it isn't his fault if we take the drop, let's get that straight.

There won't be any points coming from Anfield, it's a game for pride and a game to show that we can battle when we need to. We certainly need to battle to keep Newcastle United FC in the Premier League.
