Chris Hughton has said he's very keen on strengthening his current crop of players will a couple of new arrivals. However, whether these arrivals will be permanent of not, is another matter. Reports are suggesting that although Ashley has agreed to back Chris in the transfer market, no new permanent arrivals could indeed land at St.James' Park during the Christmas  period. There's no doubt that numbers are needed for a vigorous upcoming Coca Cola Championship campaign, but we're about a quarter of the way through and doing decently well.

Speaking he said :


> _“If you are asking if I have been told figures, then no,” “What I have been told is it’s my responsibility to determine what I need to bring in. If I need to strengthen, they (the board) would support me in that.”_
>
>  _“In my endeavours to get where we want to be in January, the board will support me in terms of tackling what needs to be tackled.”_
>
>  _“I need to determine what areas I need to bring players into. If we have injuries we are stretched so I will target the areas and players needed.”_
>
>  _“And I have been told I will be supported. There might be a loan signing, a fee signing, but that is to be worked on.”_

Chris is a man to tell the truth so we very much believe him, however, the hierarchy's honestly is very questionable. To be quite frank, there's no way that they can repair any of the damage done to NUFC and us, the supporters.

We lost to Sunderland for the first time in years, although you have to say Steve Bruce's side are very impressive at the minute. We were relegated and for the last 5 months, hanging by a thread on would we be sold or not.

So it happens we weren't, (big surprise) and Ashley has pledged to try bring Newcastle United FC back to the Premier League. He can't be can aid Chris and boy's mission to repay the Geordies by funding a few signings in January.

Comments welcome 🙂
