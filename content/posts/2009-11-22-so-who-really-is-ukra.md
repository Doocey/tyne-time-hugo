I suppose a lot of you are wondering who this guy really is, and to be honest, there isn't a whole lot of information out there about him. Two things we do know is that he's a Portuguese U-21 international and the second is that he's on loan from Porto. Chris Hughton is being linked with a swoop for him and the Portuguese striker said he's be interested in hearing what we have  to offer him. Ukra is very highly rated in Portugal and that's why he finds himself with one of the biggest clubs in the country, FC Porto.

Speaking, he said :

> 'It's always motivating that big clubs are interested but I'll have to wait on Porto to make a decision over my future,'
>
> 'I have a contract until June 2011, but any offer which came along would be analyzed and studied.'

At the age of twenty one, it is really time to be breaking on to the big stage of football and he's currently on loan from Porto at Olhanense. We do like the fact that we're being linked with youngsters like himself but buying these type of players could be a totally different story.

If you have any inside info on Ukra then do tell us, because I'm sure there's a lot of Toon fans out there that aren't too clear on who this guy really is.
