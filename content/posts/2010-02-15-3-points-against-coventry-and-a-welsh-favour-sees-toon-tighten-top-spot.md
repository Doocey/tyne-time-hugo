Our point against Swansea City on Saturday may have had some people questioning it's value, but looking at the Coca Cola Championship it means a whole lot to the title hopes of Newcastle United FC. A last gasp header from Andy Carroll saw us return home from the Liberty Stadium aloft the table again, but only just. Later that day as you all know by now, Nottingham Forest  lost to Doncaster making it a second defeat in a row following their loss at The Ricoh Arena, in Coventry. Although that somewhat helped Newcastle United, West Brom's nervy 2-0 win at home to Scunthorpe ensured they went even on points with us, and knocked us off the top temporarily, thanks to goal difference.

Newcastle happen to have a high-flying Coventry City next on their list, at St.James' Park and any slip-up in this game guarantees a shift around in the Coca Cola Championship table.

However, after a little research and some serious Photoshoppin' * including the CCC table, I noticed that West Brom will be playing their next game away to Cardiff City :D. Dave Jones men got a mauling from us a couple of weeks ago but since then, have had some gradual improvement.

I really do think Cardiff can beat West Bromich Albion when they meet and if they happen to do so, and we manage three points against Coventry, then the table will look a little bit better and that's not even mentioning what could happen to Forest in their next encounter.

We do need to keep optimistic and forget all the negative vibes that are roaming around the Toon right now. If we keep our heads down and continue our good form at home then we should really get 6 points from our next two games against Coventry and Preston North End respectively.

Who knows, West Brom are due a little blip soon enough and Jara, who's been pretty influential for Brom throughout the season, is expected to miss the remainder of the Championship campaign.

Time will tell and sure all we can do it wait and see like we've always done.
