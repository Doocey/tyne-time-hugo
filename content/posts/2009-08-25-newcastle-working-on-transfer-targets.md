### Hughton - Doesn't look best pleased!

As the transfer window closes in about a week, the only player we've signed has been Danny Simpson from Manchester United, on loan. Although we haven't added any new players to our squad besides Danny, we've let nearly 10 players leave St.James' Park. The likes of Michael Owen, Mark Viduka, David Edgar, Obafemi Martins, Damien Duff, Habib Beye , Sebastien Bassong and Peter Lovenkrands have all left the club for pastures anew. Most notably, Michael Owen at Manchester United, Bassong to Spurs and Habib Beye to a promising Aston Villa side.

There is no doubt we need to buy some new players but that seems pretty impossible considering how our owenership is being sorted. Barry Moat is the only runner for Newcastle now, and he has been given extra time to muster up the fee required. That's all and well but where is the money for the wage bill, transfers etc. going to come from? No offence to Barry Moat but he may well turn out like Mike Ashley, only with no money. I certainly hope he does become the new owner, and has some financial backing from elsewhere because he seems that he might know how to run a football club.

There are plenty of players willing to join NUFC, from Per Ciljan Skjelbred, Jermaine Beckford, and Peter Lovernkrands. In all probability, we won't get any new permanent signings and will lose more players. Steven Taylor is being touted to leave to Villa yet again, and Jose Enrique could well be on his way to Atletico. When will this roller coaster end?
