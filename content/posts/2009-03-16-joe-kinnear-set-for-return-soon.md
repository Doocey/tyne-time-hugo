### Kinnear - Should be back for Stoke game

Derek Llambias today angrily denied reports that Joe Kinnear had suffered another setback in his quest to recovery. Another crappy Sunday tabloid paper reported that Kinnear may not return at all this season and a replacement could be lined up quite soon. Kinnear who fell ill before the only win we've had in some time now at West Brom has successfully recovered or well on his way to recovering from major heart surgery. Next up for Newcastle are Arsenal and that will be another important game as will the remaining 8 games after Arsenal.

I've said it before and I'll say ti again, I really think we can get something from the Arsenal game and then perhaps a win at Chelsea at Stoke would somewhat ease the pressures ðŸ˜€ It's so tight this year with Sunderland who seemed clear are now only 3 points off Newcastle and inevitably the bottom three. Further up the table Tottenham could be dragged back into it however they seem to have enough (money) to stay away this year. Our next three fixtures are : **Arsenal (H), Chelsea (H) Stoke (A)** and **Tottenham (A)**. It would be a success if we got 9 points from them four games but that alone would be highly doubtful! Prove us wrong lads!
