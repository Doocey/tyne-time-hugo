### Beckford - Is he really worth the hassle of luring to Toon?

It's no lie to say that Jermaine Beckford is probably the best striker in League 1 albeit closely followed by Grant Holt of Norwich City. Racking up 16 goals to date, Beckford of course is attracting interest from beyond League 1 and our very own Newcastle United have been linked many a time with the 6'2 London born striker. It's believed that Beckford was being scouted and chased  by the Toon Army when Dennis Wise was somehow in charge or sourcing new players for what was then, Kevin Keegan's Newcastle United.

Hughton said today :

> _“Jermaine Beckford is one of a few players that will, of course, be of interest to us.“In the work that we’ve done over the last few weeks and months, there have been numerous names that have been thrown at us._
>
> _“We have to look at all the options we have, but, certainly, Jermaine’s a player that will come into those options.”_

> _He can't say it much clearer. Hughton would like Jermaine Beckford playing in a Black and White jersey, and sooner rather than later. My question is however, is Beckford good enough for Newcastle?_
>
> _As we lay top of the table, a few points ahead of West Brom, it does look like an immediate return for us Magpies to the Premier League. However, it's far from certain yet. My question to you, is signing a League 1 striker, 26 years of age a good direction to be taking when it looks as if Premier League football beckons in 6 months time?_
>
> _I don't think it is. Fair enough Beckford could be a very neat striker and I have saw signs in his play to suggest he can move up a level or two. However, he's quite a controversial character too and has had his fair share of problems at his respective clubs._
>

Perhaps I'm wrong, maybe this guy could set the Coca Cola Championship alight and distance Newcastle United from West Brom and our promotion rivals. Maybe he's just reaching his potential as we speak. Either way, it seems as Chris Hughton wants him.

It's not only Chris who is said to want him though, reports are that Hull City & maybe even Blackburn Rovers could make a move for the hitman. As January approaches, it seems as if Chris is preparing a list of targets and realistic ones too.

If we Beckford is on it, and we do sign the lad, what next?

Comments welcome 🙂
