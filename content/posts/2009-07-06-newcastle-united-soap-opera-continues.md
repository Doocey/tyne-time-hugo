The Newcastle United trauma continues  with no sign of a buyer close to completing a buyout anytime soon and now a reliable source to the club at Newcastle believes the sale could take another month. According to nufc.com the source believes that Ashley is still trying to scape some money from wherever he can get it and this probably involved selling Obafemi Martins, Fabricio Coloccini, Jonas Gutierrez, Sebastien Bassong and who knows else.

Nothing has changed at the club besides the pre-season friendlies. No new manager, no new signings or indeed most importantly, no new owners. All of us seems to be reporting the same old each day of every week and now the Malaysians interest in questionable. How about this for a thought - Mike Ashley as owner and Chris Hughton, Colin Calderwood as manager heading into our first game at the Hawthorns. Hopefully this won't be the case but it's looking more likely each day as we miss out on new players, day after day. Save us please.
