### Best - Only needs his first goal for the club and more will follow

A lot of people have doubted the talent of Leon Best in the last few weeks and are concerned that he might have been a poor signing from Chris Hughton. Leon arrived on Tyneside in a dream move (for him) on the last day of the transfer window in January of this year. The former Coventry striker had scored reached double figures in the league with Coventry up until his move but he  is yet to bag his first goal for Newcastle United in what's been a very successful Coca Cola Championship campaign.

For me, it's only a matter of time before the Irishman scores his first goal in Black & White, and when he hits hie debut goal then I'm very confident it won't be his last. We've seen it through the years that a lot of strikers only need one goal for belief and they can go on and score bucket-loads.

To be honest, I'd go as far as to say that if Shola Ameobi was fit all season, he would be top scorer in the Coca Cola Championship as of now. Kevin Nolan has bagged quite a few goals, with Peter Lovenkrands and Andy Carroll very close, if not already in double figures for their tally this season.

It's great to see that we're scoring goals in abundance and indeed on a side-note, good to see that we're looking at young promising talents to bolster our squad with come the summer. Our latest target is rumoured to be Lille's Eden Hazard,m who many will know for his great potential rating on Football Manager 2010 and indeed FIFA 10.

Whether we'll actually go out and buy these guys is another matter but it's always encouraging to see that we are taking a look at them, Graham Carr, Newcastle United's chief scout in particular.

With Scunthorpe on Wednesday in another must-win game, we might just see Leon Best get his first goal for the Toon Army, and reward the brilliant support from the wonderful fans all season.
