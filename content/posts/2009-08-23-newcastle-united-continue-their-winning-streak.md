### Llambias - Shocking performance on Satruday

Quite literally my headline suggests what I'm touching on, the absurd news of Derek Llambias running across the pitch in Selhurst park, totally naked. To think Newcastle couldn't get any more, media attention but no , we're brought to new depths. The best part is, we won two nil, and kept our third clean sheet, meaning we go top, even with our neighbours Middlesbrough. Things have gone really well for us so far, and all we need is the sale of the club to boost the morale even higher, however, with that behaviour from our hierarchy, I think (unfortunately), they may be tempted to keep the club, and take NUFC off the market.

Two great goals from Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor, seen off Warnock's side and indeed Warnock couldn't complain about any goals, or any balls hitting off marchions so, he accepted defeat and will carry on. Crystal Palace are in a similar position to us, ownership is trying to be sorted out. So far so good as I've already said, but we need signings, and quite a few. The reports are, that Steven Taylor could be forced out of the club before a sale is finally pushed true and this would be disastrous news, to say the least. We need Steve for our season and as odd as it may sound, he needs us to.

> “Steven feels like he is being forced out of the club and is devastated at the idea of leaving,”

We'd hate to see Steve leave and it's pretty obvious he isn't keen on departing either. What's next for the mighty Newcastle United?

Comments welcome 🙂
