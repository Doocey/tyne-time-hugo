## Ebondo - Expected in Toon soon

Albin Ebondo, Toulouse's right back is expected to be a Magpie no sooner than tomorrow. Kinnear who identified M'Bia as a target also suggested that Albin was on their shortlist and that a deal could be in the works. Today Kinnear spoke openly about his attraction towards Ebondo and hinted that he could be a Newcastle player very soon indeed. It would be just what we need too as the transfer window hots up, with Given looking set for City and new rumours suggesting Michael Owen could be soon gone, us Magpies need reinforcements, sooner the better too ðŸ™‚

Joe said:

_'__A team from Newcastle has been over there talking to the club and the player and we're confident he'll be here on Monday,''We will work right until the final minute of the final day of the window to bring in the players we want.

'We are working around the clock to get the players we need but it's not an easy time of the year to do business and it's been hard work.'


_'I do feel as though we are getting somewhere and if I can bring in the two players we're close to agreeing deals for then I'll be feeling a lot happier about the state of the squad,' added Kinnear.'I identified Albin Ebondo when I went to see Toulouse play a few weeks ago and he will be an excellent player for us, I'm confident about that.

'Hopefully he'll be here on Monday and in training with the rest of the squad straight after that.'_

I for one would be happy to secure the signature of Ebondo, touted as a future French international (although 24 ðŸ˜€ ) either way I'd take him at Newcastle thank you very much and I'm sure most Geordies would like to see him in for the derby ðŸ˜€

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
