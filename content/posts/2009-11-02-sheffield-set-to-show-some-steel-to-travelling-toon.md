###Â Evans - Will be a big threat tonight

There's no doubt that Newcastle United will tonight face a very tough challenge if they are to overcome Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. It's been quite a while since these two teams last met and it will prove to be an exciting affair. With Sheffield leaking a lot of goals of late and Fabricio Coloccini set to return to an unreliable Newcastle United defence, the score tonight is truly  unpredictable. West Brom took top spot with a bang as they dispatched of Watford in The Hawthorns. Tonight however could see us go top again by two points if we manage to nab all the spoils.

As my headline suggests, this won't be a careful approach by Sheffield and we'd certainly hope that the same applies to the lads that line out in Black and White tonight.

From the first whistle we need to get stuck in and don't give them an inch of space. If we can keep the pressure up for the first ten minutes + get the ball on the deck and pass it around, I wouldn't be surprised if we take the lead.

Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll will be well marked and Marlon Harewood I'm sure will be given a chance to get the better of the infamous Chris Morgan should he line out tonight.

I'm sure there will be goals and it wouldn't surprise me if Sheffield do come away victorious. Their fans will hound anything Black and White but as former Premier League footballers, we'd expect the likes of Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor to deal with it.

The mighty Toon fans will be heard in the stands and will once again encourage the lads to soldier on. For the supporters, Chris and indeed the players, we hope that Newcastle United are top of the Coca Cola Championship tomorrow morning.

**Tyne Time's Prediction :** Sheffield United 1-2 Newcastle United
