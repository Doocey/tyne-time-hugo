We hear of it from tabloids don't we?

Kinnear hasn't been given any money to spend and he's going to lose his job and quess what? We're in a relegation battle although we are 14th?

Don't take heed of the papers, I have no respect for them so I'm not even going to name some of them as they'd just love the advertisement.

Its a tough one to crack but in the end only Kinnear, Wise and indeed Ashley knows what's going on. Only they know how much money (if there is Â any) Kinnear has to spend and indeed whether Wise will take charge of transfers. Wise sold Milner, simple as, to the disontent of the Toon fans but the fact he left, Wise tried his best to get Bastian Schweinsteiger, the deal was in place for him with both clubs with a fee agreed but Bastian himself pulled the plug as he changed his mind, deep into discussing personal terms. It would have been a good replacement for Milner but it never happened, although Jonas GutierrÃ©z wo arrived on a controversal free from Mallorca has proven what a great asset to the club he is, first of all showing his great attitude and secondly doing his talking on the pitch. Who will forget the 1-1 draw at Manchester United when Jonas and his compatriot Fabriczio Coloccini stunned the Utd fans with top class performances on the day.

Jonas was probably unfortunate not to have been awarded a penalty some way into the second half when Vidic grounded him, however I think most Toon fans would've taken the point before the game anyways ðŸ˜€

The latest rumours are Xisco and JosÃ© Enrique leaving Newcastle, I've heard Salamanca want Xisco and well teh media just made up the Enrique story.

A man who could well head is Shay Given, what a servant to the club he's been, seasons after seasons, conceading after conceading he still stayed without saying a single word of dis-content and perhaps it is time for him to play at a far higher level than he is.

He deserves Champions League football and to win major trophys. Saying this I wouldn't want him to leave but if he does no-one can blame him or hold a grudge against him as he's been on of Newcastle's best players ever and indeed the best keeper in the Premier League for some time now. Just because he plays behind a unreliable defence although it has improved, doesn't mean Given isin't the best in the world. In my opinion he is the number one in the world, better than Reina, Buffon, Casillas, Cech and most definitely van der Sar.

I will keep the updates on the transfer scenario rolling each day.

Comments welcome ðŸ˜€
