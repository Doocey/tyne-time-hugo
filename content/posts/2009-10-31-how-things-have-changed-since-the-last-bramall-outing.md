###Â Martins - Firing home back in 2007 from a James Milner's cross

Newcastle will visit Bramall for the first time since 2007 if my memory serves me correctly. On quite a sunny afternoon in Sheffield, Newcastle United beat the hosts 2-1, thanks to goals from Obafemi Martins, and Newcastle's very own Steven Taylor. However, looking back on the team that went out and played that day, very few are still with the club, and it's not that long ago to be  fair. It's suiting that Steve Taylor scored the winner in that match but unfortunate all the same that he won't be making the trip to Sheffield on Monday for our latest Coca Cola Championship game.

The team that played against Sheffield United that day back in 2007 was :

**Team :** _Given, Solano, Moore, Taylor, Carr, Milner, Butt, Parker, Duff, Sibierski, Martins_.

**Subs :** _Steve Harper, Celestine Babayaro Antonie Sibierski, Kieron Dyer, Emre, Onyewu._

Two of the starting line up are still with the team today, Nicky Butt and Steven Taylor, whilst one of the bench, the long serving Steve Harper will line out between the sticks for us on Monday.

The likes of Oba Martins, Shay Given, James Milner and Damien Duff have all moved on to better things while the likes of Sibierski and Solano have hung up their boots.

So how about that, a blast from the past!
