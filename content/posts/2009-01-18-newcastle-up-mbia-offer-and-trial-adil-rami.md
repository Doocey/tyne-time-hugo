## Rami - To go on trial with Newcastle?

Kinnear has told Sky Sports last night that he is considering upping his bid for Stephane M'Bia to nearly Â£10m and possibly even cancelling the loan deals that may be in the works. We can only assume the loan deals would be cancelled because of the cost of them but one thing is for certain, we need faces and quickly! Another player Kinnear is supposedly after is Lille's Adil Rami, a young Moroccan center back who is quite highly rated in France and it seems he could be making his way to Newcastle on a trial, we certainly hope he can be the next Seb Bassong ðŸ˜€

Losing to Blackburn yesterday was a sore hit and we now lay in a difficult position however Middlesbrough and other teams such as Spurs are in a worse position to the say the least, and they've spend Â£30-50m last summer, oh and another nice amount for Jermain Defoe. I for one am sick of all the negativity coming from some Toon fans, claiming we'l be relegated and that Joe has to go. If Joe goes then the odds are very high that we may well go down, keeping Kinnear till his summer is crucial to survival. If we get 3 players to arrive here including powerhouse M'Bia we should be fine and it shouldÂ  guarantee our Premier League status
