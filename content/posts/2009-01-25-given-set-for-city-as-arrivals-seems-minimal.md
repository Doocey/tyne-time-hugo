## Given - A great servant to NUFC no matter what happens

Well it seems that this has been coming for some time now, the departure of Shay Given, Ireland's and indeed Newcastle's best ever keeper. Season after season he never intended to leave even after near relegation on a number of occasions. Now after a very poor year for Newcastle, it seems Given is set to leave after 11 great years wearing the famous Magpies shirt. No one can blame him really, with all the instability at Newcastle, with owner Mike Ashley's poor communication with the fans and with the legend Kevin Keegan forced to leave, who wouldn't want to leave?

Probably the best keeper in the Premier League, Shay Given has deserved success a lot more than some players that have received it. Featuring game after game, he made save after save and, the Liverpool game which I won't say too much on was the lowest point of his career, and probably the best tribute you could show to a young keeper that would like to follow in Shay's footsteps. Of course Manchester City will offer Given a lot of money to join, and we certainly hope they offer us a lot too, Â£30m would do nice thank you Abu Dhabi ðŸ˜€

On other fronts, it seems we're linked with a new striker ever day, the latest being a Costa Rican. As well as this Luis Garcia (yes former Liverpool) has been linked with Joe Kinnear supposedly interested, he wouldn't be a bad addition. We would like to expect some great activity on Monday on incoming signings, but there is nothing to suggest that just yet.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
