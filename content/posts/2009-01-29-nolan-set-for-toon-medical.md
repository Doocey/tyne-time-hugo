## Nolan - Seems that quick move could happen.

I reported earlier that a fee had been agreed for Kevin Nolan between Newcastle and Bolton and it now seems that the deal has taken a step further with Nolan reportedly all set for a medical tomorrow. This would be an unexpected deal, not just the man who is coming but indeed if the deal is this quick, we aren't used to rapid progress at Newcastle. Nolan who would be a big player on Sunday should he be here by then, would slot into midfield against Sunderland and could you imagine if he hit the back of the net?!

Expected to sign a 3 and a half year deal it seems the team are eventually starting to pull up their socks and get digging, although it may be a fraction too late. on other news fronts Charles N'Zogbia has said he will never play for Newcastle again under Kinnear, we hope that means he'll be gone tomorrow and we'll have a few more players in. Ebondo is expected, now Nolan and even the possibility of Javier Saviola arriving on loan could still happen. Veloso is another name tossed about but we think Nolan may be our Veloso ðŸ˜€ More activity expected as the January transfer window hots up.
