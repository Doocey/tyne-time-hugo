![Xisco worth recalling for January promotion push?](https://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00979/xisco_979491c.jpg)

One of our readers asked the question whether recalling Francisco JimÃ©nez Tejada or more commonly known as Xisco, could solve Newcastle's continuing forward problems. We've been constantly linked with Jermaine Beckford but most have forgotten our own player Xisco, who is still on the books at Newcastle United. Although on loan at Racing Santander at the minute, I'd beÂ  pretty confident there's a clause in his contract which allows us to recall him at anytime from his loan in Spain. He did cost Â£5.75m after all and it's fair to say that we haven't got any value for money just yet.

So, do you think he'd be worth recalling and giving a go in what will prove to be a tough New Year period for Newcastle United? With West Brom coming up very soon indeed, it's important that we've most of our players fit and maybe even Joey Barton could recover in time for the tie.

Dennis Wise was the mastermind behind the Xisco signing on the last day of the season, the eve of Kevin Keegan's fallout with the board at St.James' Park. A solitary goal at home to Hull, which we lost 2-1 was Xisco's only goal on the books for Newcastle. Who'll ever forget that memorable tap in from 6 yards? ðŸ˜€

Either way, we're still paying a huge chunk of his wages and he deserves another go in the Black and White jersey of Newcastle, perhaps this is the perfect time. He has scored once or twice in Spain for Racing and I know there's goals in the lad.

Just an idea although the likelihood of the 23-year old returning from sunny Spain to a snowed-down Newcastle isn't great.
