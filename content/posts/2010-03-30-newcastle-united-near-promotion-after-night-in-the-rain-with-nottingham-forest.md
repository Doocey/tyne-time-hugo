![Jose Enrique scores for the Toon](https://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01606/jose_enrique2_1606294c.jpg "Enrique scored a very nice goal to top off a tight affair at St.James' Park")

The descending rain at St.James' Park last night could not dampen spirits around Newcastle as the Magpies look very certain for an immediate return to the Premier League. In what was a tight and physical affair, Nottingham put the lads to the test in every department and on another day could've nabbed a couple of goals. Indeed goals from Shola Ameobi who replaced the injured  Andy Carroll and our Spanish left-back Jos√© Enrique secured a very important three points for Chris Hughton's side.

Our next game, away to Peterborough could see us automatically promoted should Forest fail to gain all three points at Bristol City. However, we needn't worry about other teams and their results now, because we are definitely guaranteed a Premier League spot if we win two more games.

Chris Hughton, still however is adamant that Newcastle United have not crossed the finishing line and said after last night's game that he has not patted himself and the players on the back for a job well done just yet.

> _‚ÄúThere are no points targets. The only target is to win promotion and if there is a points tally that comes with it and other plaudits, then I will accept them gladly.‚Äù_

We're hopeful that we'll secure promotion in the coming weeks and get Newcastle United back to the Premier League.

Sorry about the absence of Tyne Time v Dean Midas Maynard article for the game last night but I was proudly part of the crowd to cheers the lads on to victory. Anyway, these were our predictions for the Forest game :

Tyne Time - Newcastle United 3-1 Nottingham Forest

Dean Midas Maynard - Newcastle United 2-1 Nottingham Forest.

I suppose you could say Dean was closer scoreline wise but I was right in the amount of goals we won by. The standings are as follows :

Tyne Time - **25pts**

Dean Midas Maynard - **20pts**

As of now, Tyne Time leads the challenge but there's a few games to go, noneless than our tricky away tie to Peterborough.
