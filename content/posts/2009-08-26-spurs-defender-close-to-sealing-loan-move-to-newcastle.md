### Bale - Would be a good addition

It appears, well according to the BBC, that Gareth Bale is very close to joining Newcastle United on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The news breaks after Newcastle's emphatic win against Huddersfield Town, well maybe not emphatic, but it was a memorable sight. When is the last time we've  came from 1-3 down and still win?

Anyway, there's sure to be more details following this outburst of news, but it would be rather warming to get Bale in, as I personally, rate him very highly, even though he hasn't overly impressed at Tottenham.

Then again, this signing could mean Mike Ashley is staying on, however, that claim might be a little far fetched, as Barry Moat was at the game in St.James' again today.

Comments welcome
