### Vuckic - Delighted after scoring his first goal for Newcastle United

Newcastle kicked off their first preparation for the upcoming Premier League campaign by defeating Carlisle by three goals, with Leon Best, Haris Vuckic and Nile Ranger all hitting the back of the net. I've yet to see the goals but they were meant to be nice finishes from all three. Whilst seeing off The Cumbrians, the Toon lads sported the new Newcastle United away strip, and it's a  very nice jersey to say the least. A change from banana yellow, to simplistic white, has gone down well with the Toon faithful and is selling like hot-cakes at the club store, both at St.James' and online.

Today was a good warm-up for the lads who have a very tough season in front of them, starting at Old Trafford on the Monday after the Premier League has kicked into action. Hopefully by then, we'll have a couple new signings, Lionel Messi and Thomas MÃ¼ller widely tipped to come to St. James' Park next season ðŸ˜€

Chris Hughton will no doubt be pleased to see Best score his first for Newcastle, and also to see Haris open his account for the reigning Coca Cola Championship champions. In the midst of all this, Steven Taylor suffered a shoulder injury, how serious - I'm not fully sure but we'll get an update from the club very soon I guess. Jeff Henderson came on to replace him, so a nice run out for the lad too.

So, our first pre-season game down, if anyone of you made the trip to Brunton Park Stadium do leave us your comments and thoughts on the game today.
