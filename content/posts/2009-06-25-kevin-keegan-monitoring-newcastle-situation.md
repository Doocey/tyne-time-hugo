![Keegan - Thats what he thinks of Newcastles situation](https://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01207/kevin_keegan_1207778c.jpg)

There are reports today that Kevin Keegan who apparently in talks with Southampton, is monitoring Newcastle's situation. Keegan who was Newcastle boss this time last year was forced  to resign and from then on, Newcastle fell and eventually our fall was broken with what is, the Championship. We know that Keegan wouldn't take Newcastle for a final time but then again you never know with 'The Messiah'. Southampton are reportedly trying to seal the contract though and we'd expect him to end up there.

A source close to Kevin said :

> 'Kevin's been looking at Newcastle's situation since Shearer took over in April, he honestly thought Alan could save them from relegation but it wasn't to be'
>
> ' Obviously Newcastle United still holds a big spot in Kevin's heart and he doesn't like what he sees going on. Kevin is interested in what happens when Mike Ashley finally sells up and is monitoring the situation'

This is more than likely nonsense talk but we know that Newcastle does mean a lot to Kevin, even after he resigned twice. Could the Messiah return yet again? We wouldn't think so, as all of the consortia interested all want Shearer as manager. We'll settle for the new 'Messiah' that is Shearer ðŸ˜€
