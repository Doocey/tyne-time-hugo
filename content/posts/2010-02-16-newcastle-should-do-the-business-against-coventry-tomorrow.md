### Coleman - Would love to disrupt Newcastle United's title hopes tomorrow

With Cardiff and West Bromich Albion drawing 1-1 in Wales tonight and Nottingham Forest overcoming Sheffield United, it means a Newcastle United victory can see Chris Hughton's side go three points clear of their nearest rivals in Brom. With Newcastle playing tomorrow at home to Coventry City the three points will mean even more, should we be able to get them. In my  opinion , I think we will and we really should too, however, Coventry are now slouches of late and can boast quite a nice recent record, including a victory over Forest two weeks ago.

With Shola Ameobi ruled out for another fortnight, Leon Best, Andy Carroll and Peter Lovenkrands will all be determined to secure their 1st team spot and if Carroll & indeed Lovenkrands can keep their scoring form at home going, then they should have no problem being first team regulars.

Chris Coleman's side, who saw their leading goalscorer in Leon Best depart to Newcastle United on the final day of the transfer window will be up for the challenge tomorrow and will fancy all three points too. It'll be up to us to stop them.

If we play anything like we did against Swansea City a few days ago then I'd fancy Coventry to steal the points, however, I'm pretty confident we won't produce the same form at home, in front of 40,000+ roaring spectators.

The title challenge is getting going now, and three points at home to Coventry tomorrow + hopefully another 3 at home to Preston North End, who happened to lose 5-3 to Derby tonight, should see us enter the final stages of the season in a confident mood.

We'd hope for a similar performance to our demolition of Cardiff a week or so ago, but we'll just have to see what's in store tomorrow.
