![Ashley - Does he realize what hes doing?](https://festivaloffootball.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/mike_ashley_newcast_353448a.jpg)

We're nearly half a third of the way through the month of June now and Newcastle after being relegated are looking for new owners, a new manager and new players. Of course nothing is ever straight forward with Newcastle and we'll probably  have to wait until mid July before any 'real' interest is shown in our club. The man in charge of selling our club has already indicated that there is 'real and decent' interest in Newcastle United Football Club, but we're yet too see any of this yet. Sunderland have had a change of owners, West Ham are safe after new owners , Portsmouth have been bought by a rich Asian, even Notts County have had an Arab take them over. Why can't it be simple for us? We're one of the biggest clubs in England even though we're still in the Championship.

Since Mike Ashley has been here, there has been nothing but problems. It started when Big Sam Allardyce left by 'mutual termination' (being paid to resign), then came the Keegan Era in January 2008. It went well, Keegan got them playing football on the pitch, saved us from relegation Â and got 4 points out of his first two Premier League games in the 08/09 season, none less than a point at Old Trafford. Then cam tragedy, Keegan ha a fall out and resigned, then came Joe Kinnear, who nearly left his position at Newcastle in another way, then Hughton and then finally Shearer.

Shearer wasn't able to save us and now we're a Championship team. The fixtures will be coming out soon of who we've to play. More importantly we need owners sorted very soon or we are the need Leeds, maybe worse.
