###Â Ryan - Has settled well on Tyneside

You could nearly say that he's been one our players of the season so far. Chipping in with a couple of goals too, and no ordinary goals mind you. Ryan Taylor's latest was against Ipswich when he caught the keeper in an awkward position and caressed it into the top corner, and not a fluke as some may have suggested. He also hit the target with a stunning strike, with his left this time,  into the other top corner, in a two nil win against Crystal Palace earlier this year. However, he'll sit out the tie at St.James' Park between Newcastle and Queens Park Rangers.

He'll be missed on the right, that's for sure, but I think that Danny Simpson will be switched to RB and perhaps Danny Guthrie placed on the right wing. Guthrie has also been impressive this season, as we expected him to be.

In other good news, Jonas Gutierrez returns to Newcastle's side to face the 'rich' Rangers. We've been lacking a bit down the left for the last while and Jonas is sure to add some running, at the least to an already energetic Toon side.

If we win on Wednesday, then we'll remain top, regardless of other results. Then we're up against Bristol City at St.James' again, although it would nearly be more suiting to play them away from home.

We hope that it's six points from the next two fixtures but QPR and Bristol won't be any pushovers as we saw with bottom of the league, Plymouth Argyle.
