### Stead - Nabbed winner against Cardiff City today

A former Sunderland striker today secured a vital win for Roy Keane and his Ipswich Town side but also helped Newcastle United as well as a couple of other teams. After the defeat, it now leaves Cardiff in 7th, 12 points off Newcastle and Ipswich are now off the bottom of the table, leaping above Peterborough. What's more is that we've played Cardiff City at theirs and you might  remember that Fabricio Coloccini scored the winner in that hard fought game. Cardiff are far from out of the running but it's always nice to see fellow promotion contenders lose.

So, Newcastle win, Sunderland lose and Middlesbrough draw - Seems about right eh? ðŸ˜€

West Brom however are only two points behind us, as third spot, occupied by Leicester see an either point gap between the top of the table. Our next match is at home to Watford on Saturday, the 5th of December. Baring in mind, Watford aren't in great form but have the ability to cause big problems to Newcastle, that's for sure.

So, with Leicester conceding a 94th minute goal at Glanford Park, Cardiff losing their 3rd game in a row at home to Ipswich and Middlesbrough drawing late on against Peterborough, we can't really complain about this weekends football.

Saying that, we can't let any of this happen to us, and we must ensure that no slip-ups are made.
