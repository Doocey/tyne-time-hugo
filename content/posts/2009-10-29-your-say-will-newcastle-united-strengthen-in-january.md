![Hughton - Will have funds or so they say](https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/3/25/1237995970848/Chris-Hughton-001.jpg)

Now that Mike Ashley has decided to keep Newcastle United firmly within his grasp, reports are rife of players Chris Hughton is already lining up come January and when the transfer window opens again. Mike has promised to invest Â£20m of his own money by the end of the week, and a lot of that is believed to be going into the transfer pot for Chris, although I find  that hard to believe. Today, I'm giving you the chance to say who you'd like and I know that list probably starts with Mike Ashley gotten rid of, but this is for players :D.

Just name the player, price and why you think the footballer should wear the Black and White of Newcastle United.
