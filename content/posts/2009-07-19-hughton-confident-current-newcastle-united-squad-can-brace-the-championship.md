### Taylor - Scored again yesterday with a header

After a comprehensive  hammering yesterday, Newcastle United are still waiting on new owners and indeed waiting we've been. It's been well over 40 days since relegation and the only real changes have been players leaving on free contracts. Michael Owen being the most noticeable, scoring the winner on his début in Malaysia. Speaking after the match Chris Hughton indicated he expected an 'announcement' soon and he gave the impression that he wasn't going to be head coach of Newcastle United for much longer.

He said :

> “If that’s the squad we have come the first day of the season, we would be delighted.
>
> “We have certainly got a good enough squad and a good enough team to acquit ourselves very well in this division, that I have got no doubts about.”

We as fans obviously want some changes and certainly some lower waged players to come in with higher earners shipped out. Have we a good enough team for the Coca Cola Championship? This league, at times, can be a lot harder than the Premier League.

Comments welcome 🙂
