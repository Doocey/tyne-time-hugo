### Hughton - Will he sign any players?

I haven't been on in a day or so and I see not much has changed, besides the good news that Steven Taylor is committed to the club and also the fact that we can go top of the Championship if we beat Leicester tonight. Chris Hughton promised Toon fans a hectic day of transfer activity when the window slams shut on Tuesday but the signs aren't really backing up that statement. So far we've  lost about 10 players, and now Xisco has left for Racing Santander on loan, meaning we have lost another striker.

Chris has indeed indicated that he is again in the hunt for Peter Lovenkrands and we understand that 'McLoven' would be interested in returning also but Birmingham might be a better option for the experienced midfielder. However, we´d love to see him strut his stuff on Tyneside again,that's for sure. The deal for James Vaughan is still on the line, his addition would be a very good one indeed whilst it seems that the deal for Gareth Bale, is dead in the water.

We need reinforcements and fast, if we can manage about 3 loan signings or maybe four, then we'll be doing very well indeed. James Vaughan, Gareth Bale, and free agent Peter Lovenkrands would certainly make me a little happier with the thread-bare squad we currently have.
