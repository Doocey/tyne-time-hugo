### Sturrock - Not our transfer target, but his manager

Reported Newcastle United target Marcel Seip, from Plymouth Argyle, has been placed on the transfer window after a bust up with manager Paul Sturrock. It was reported that Newcastle were close to signing this player last weekend but Hughton dismissed these rumours. However, just like rumours are, they don't go away too easily (especially at Newcastle) and  news is rife that we're about to complete a loan move for him within the next couple of days. Seip is 27 years old and Dutch, and I suppose any cover to our threadbare squad at the minute can't be bad.

We think Chris might be interested in him, especially as he's available on loan and that's all we can get at the minute. However, it's understood that Chris is looking for the 'right' type of player for Newcastle and whether Seip is, is another matter. One thing's for sure, we don't need another Joey Barton.

Speaking today, Paul Sturrock said :

> 'We feel it's an appropriate time for Marcel to move on,'
>
> 'He's been fined two weeks' wages for his indiscretion and placed on the transfer list.
>
> 'We know he can't transfer anywhere at this time but we would like to think the first step would be going out on loan.'

I'm sure Hughton is working on other targets at the minute like Craig Cathcart, and the likes of Marlon Harewood but we need players, not the constant rumours about who we're supposedly interested in. Marlon Harewood, Craig Cathcart, Martin Kelly and Fabio da Silva wouldn't be too bad ğŸ˜€
