### Enrique - Who will take his place at left back?

Bad news today as Shearer has confirmed that JosÃ© Enrique and Steven Taylor will miss Saturday's vital clash with Stoke at the Britannia. This is not good news at all as firstly we are lacking good defensive players and secondly who will fill Enrique's void at left back? This news may alter Shearer's tactics and he may well be forced to play 3 at the back in a more attacking side. It should also mean Coloccini will start at CB with Butt and Nolan more than likely dropping deeper to aid him. Enrique's is only a minor injury but and injury is an injury unfortunately.

Shearer said :

_'Steven won't be with us on Saturday, Jose's hurt his knee, and while it's not too bad, he won't be travelling'_

However on the better side of things Sebastien Bassong will return for the game, someone who we missed against Chelsea for sure.

_'Sebastien trained this morning, and if there's no reaction, he'll train again tomorrow and travel with us.'_

Come on lads, do us proud.
