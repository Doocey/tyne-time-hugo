### Still haven't been able to move out any high earners

With the start  of the Championship not too far away it's a frightening fact that Newcastle United could be fielding pretty much the same starting eleven that played on the final day in Villa Park, where we suffered relegation. Apart form Owen, Viduka, Edgar and Lovenkrands leaving there hasn't been much other developments especially with the new transfer embargo put on Newcastle by 'owner' Mike Ashley. The likes of Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Damien Duff, Jonas Gutierrez, Habib Beye, Steven Taylor and others could all continue to pick up their hefty pay cheques. This a scary thought, to think nothing much has been done to boost Newcastle's chances of gaining promotion at first attempt.

We expect the likes of Tamas Kadar to break into the start line up and perhaps Nile Ranger to make an impact, like he has done internationally and indeed in friendlies. Oba Martins will be pushed out of the club we suspect and your guess is as good as mine as to who will take the famous number 9 shirt when/if he leaves. We're sick of the constant uncertainty and it's come to a stage where a protest could be the way forward. NUSC are convinced it will change the hierarchy's thoughts and speed up the takeover if there is to be one. It is getting rather late regards new signings, and we don't even have a manager yet.
