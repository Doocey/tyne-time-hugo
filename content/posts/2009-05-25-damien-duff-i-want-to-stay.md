### Duff - Very unfortunate for goal v Villa

Although he may have scored the goal that inevitably sent Newcastle United down to the Championship, Damien Duff has no intention of leaving. Speaking today he talked about how muchÂ it hurt him for Newcastle to go down and how he never thought he'd

suffer it again following Blackburn's relegation years ago. He has pledged his future to Newcastle in order for them to bounce straight back up to the Premier League next season. Also the most obvious fact that no team would want Duff. Wages will be a big issue with the Irishman and he'd at least have to take a 50 - 55% wage cut if he is to stay.

Duff said :

> 'I'm as loyal as they come and, whether the gaffer stays or goes, I'd love to try and get Newcastle back up into the Premier League,'
>
> 'I don't know what words can describe the way I feel. I'm devastated. The lads haven't tasted relegation apart from me at Blackburn and Nicky Butt at Birmingham.
>
> 'When it happened at Blackburn, I wasn't planning on seeing it again in my career. It's not a nice feeling.
>
> 'No disrespect to the Championship, but Newcastle are too big a club to be down there. I plan on being straight back up (in the Premier League) after next season.'

That is indeed the question whether Alan Shearer will stay on as manager and talks are soon to begin over the future of the Toon legend. A massive clear out is expected and just as well for the sake of NUFC.
