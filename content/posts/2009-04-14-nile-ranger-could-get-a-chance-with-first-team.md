### Ranger - Shearer might give him a chance to shine

Alan Shearer has today said that he is not afraid to give Toon youngster Nile Ranger a chance at the big time as they travel to Spurs on Sunday. Ranger who has been in fantastic form throughout the season for both U-18's and reserves has been on the first team bench for a good few games now. However Joe Kinnear said he wouldn't give the lad a chance at a time when cool heads are needed but with Shearer as manager, he said he's more than willing to start anyone who he thinks can do well. We all know Nile is in scintillating for the reserves etc but I for one, don't know whether he's good enough to play on the biggest stage.

Shearer said :

 _“If you’re good enough – it doesn’t matter what age you are.

“If he can add something to the team, I would have no fear about putting him on.

“I said to all the guys in the reserves, ‘how you play and how you train will determine to me whether you have a part to play trying to help Newcastle United’.

“I’ve seen a response from all of them, including Nile Ranger and Andy Carroll.

“The response was great last Monday, as it has been in training.

“I said to Andy and Nile that they both have big roles to play here at this football club for the remaining games of the season.

“I told them to out and show me what they had in the reserves.

“Both of them have done that and that’s why they were in the squad for Stoke and on the bench.

“If they keep on producing results then you never know – they might get starts in games.”_

Shearer himself showed no fear when he scored a hattrick on his Southampton debut at 17 and it seems he is thinking the same for Ranger, who cam from Southampton too. We all trust Shearer with this one, and how suiting it would be if Ranger scored a screamer at Spurs on Sunday 😀

Comments appreciated 🙂
