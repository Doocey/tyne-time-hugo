###Â Sir Bobby - Thanks ever so much for all the memories

Today is the birthday of one of Newcastle's biggest legends, Sir Bobby Robson. The legend of the Toon is 76 today and his fond memories will be remembered for a long time, indeed he probably managed one of the most successful Newcastle teams and ever since he was sacked because we lost 4-2 to Aston Villa, the team has slumped and we've gone through managers like Chocolate buttons.

This video courtesy of some wishful thinking fellow is dedicated to Bobby and all the good memories he brought to Newcastle United FC :

Happy birthday Bobby and we hope that you overcome your health problems like you have done on so many occasions ðŸ™‚
