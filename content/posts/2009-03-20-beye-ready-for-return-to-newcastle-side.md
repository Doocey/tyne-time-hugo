### Beye - Could make his return in the Arsenal match

Good news today as it seems Habib Beye could make his long awaited return against Arsenal this weekend. Beye, who suffered a terrible ankle injury by a man well known for his horrific challenges Lee Cattermole is warmed to amongst the Toon fans (Beye that is). To be honest it is Beye who we have really missed at RB although Steven Taylor has done a very good job there too, chipping in with a few goals and assists (Winning the penalty v Sunderland). Whether Beye will start is still unknown but I certainly doubt it as Taylor has a good record against Arsenal, scoring in the last outing at St.James' Park in a 1-1 draw. Big Sam was in charge at that time, things have changed so much, from Allardyce to Keegan to Kinnear and now Hughton and Calderwood but Joe still very much involved.

I for one am very confident heading into this game for an unknown reason and really believe we can beat them. Should we triumph and Stoke lose alongside Middlesbrough it could be a very successful weekend for us. Should we lose then the pressure will mount even more and Joe will be itching even more to get back into the hot seat and turn things around. Obafemi Martins and Owen will play upfront with Carroll expected to come off th bench and hopefully net one. On the other side of the fence Almunia is expected to return with van Persie and Bendtner up front. I'm hoping that Bassong can put the Dutchman in his pocket like he did to Kenwyne Jones and that Coloccini will do the same with Bendtner. The best thing to do for fans attending the game is to get behind the players like was done at United. Better to be optimistic than pessimistic!
