### Brown - Looking to actually sign a player

Breaking news yet again, and it's not takeover talk, it's about a man called Phil Brown and a team by the name of Hull City. Sky Sports News are reporting that both Habib Beye and Sebastien Bassong could be  gone from Newcastle by the end of this week as Hull City have improved an offer for Beye, and Sebastien Bassong is pleading for an exit from St.James' Park with Tottenham reportedly willing to improve on their initial Â£10m bid. Phil Brown has confirmed he wants to sign Habib Beye but to be honest I'd be surprised if Beye wants to join them. Hull have had Daryl Murphy and now Bobby Zamora reject them although it's not been confirmed that Zamora has rejected them. He just won't be joining Hull anyway.

Newcastle are meant to be holding out for Â£4m for Habib Beye but Brown has already said he'd not willing to meet that valuation. I'm guessing that he'll bid in between Â£2.75 - Â£3.25m for the Senegalese international. Aston Villa are also meant to be interested in Habib and we know that he would jump at the chance to play under Martin O'Neill. For all we know Manchester City could be interested and might just offer us Â£7m for the full back, however I don't think that'll happen somehow. I'm sure there are different clubs interested, perhaps Everton, and indeed Aston Villa. Hull would be very lucky to get him but they'll have to have a bid accepted first.
