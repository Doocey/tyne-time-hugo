### Krishnan - Why only deny interest now?

Oh lordy, the nonsense continues . One minute Ananda Krishnan is all set to takeover and now he's confirmed he's **not** interested in buying the club at all. This leaves us questioning everything. Perhaps there is another Malaysian in there? Maybe it's an Asian buyer or maybe , just maybe it's that Singaporean group that said they were interested in buying last month. Who knows? We certainly don't but this is a set-back not a knockdown. The buyers are still in there, it's just not Ananda Krishnan.

Keep the faith.
