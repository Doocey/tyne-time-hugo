[Steve Finnan](http://images.teamtalk.com/08/08/800x600/Steve-Finnan_1124161.jpg "Finnan - Fails Hull medical but Kinnear still keen")

It is no surprise really that Newcastle's bid for Stephane M'Bia has been rejected, it was bound to happen. Kinnear is not giving up though after reportedly going straight back to Rennes with an improved bid, clearly he and the recruitment team aren't wasting any time 😀 We hope that Stephane would be interested and that a price can be agreed between both sides but their president has clearly stated that they have no intention of letting any more player go in January :

Pierre Dreossi stated :

_“There will be no arrivals or departures, nor any loans, even after the departure of Wiltord,”</p>

“We are not interested in the departure of any of our players.”_

We don't like to think that, however an upped bit might be too hard for Rennes to refuse in a down turning economy, we certainly hope so. Another man who was all set for Hull was Steve Finnan from Espanyol however the move was called off due to a failed medical, apparently Kinnear has now stole in and a £1.3m bid has been accepted, just personal terms and of course the medical 😀 Other reports state that Hull never had a bit accepted for Finnan and ours was the only creditable one on the table.Either way I'd be more than happy to sign Finnan, a Champions League winner, Premier League experience by the dozens, International experience at the highest level, what more can we ask for? Nice competition for Beye when he returns too 😀

Comments appreciated 🙂
