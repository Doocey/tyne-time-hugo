### Smith - Was determined to avenge the memories of Premier League relegation

As of now, Newcastle United are on 99pts at the top of the Coca Cola Championship. When we suffered relegation on the 24th of May 2009, I don't think there was many fans who expected such a rumbustious and professional display for the 45 fixtures so far. The team lost a fair few players, from Michael Owen, to Obafemi Martins. However, the guys that remained have  made Newcastle United proud and a win tomorrow would see them reach a staggering 100pts in a single season.

We'll travel to Loftus Road tomorrow to try and finish off the job we started, by claiming an impressive 102 points this Coca Cola Championship. Our Premier League status had been granted before we kicked a ball at home to Sheffield United a few weeks back and that relieved many fans and indeed players at Newcastle.

Alan Smith, Jose Enrique, Steve Harper, Danny Guthrie, and Kevin Nolan all played a massive part in getting this club where it was, and where it is now. Above anyone, those guys are desperate to reach the one hundred point mark, however, some of them may not appear on the pitch against Neil Warnock's side.

Time Krul will start between the sticks tomorrow and Haris Vuckic could well make an appearance too. I'd be surprised if Nile Ranger didn't get a run-out either. That said, we'd like to see three points tomorrow to finish off an excellent season.

If you're confident about a Newcastle taking all three points tomorrow then why not put a few pound on them? They're available for the win at about 5/4 which is one of the best prices for the Toon Army this season. What's better than watching us hit the 102pt mark while at the same time earning some hard cash? There are various links to bookies across the site for your convenience too.

Anyway, we're hoping for 102pts, wouldn't it be lovely if we managed it, with Leon Best nabbing a goal in the process ðŸ˜€
