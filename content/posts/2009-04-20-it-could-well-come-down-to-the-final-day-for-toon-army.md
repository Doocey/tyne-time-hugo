###Â Hull - Let's hope they keep falling down the table

In a story of two seasons from Hull and 4 seasons for us the Premier League's relegation candidates could be decided on the last day like it was last year with Fulham staying up. We were already safe with King Kev at the helm but how were we to know that same time next year it would be us. Hull, currently in free-fall suffered another defeat on Saturday at the hands of Sunderland. We are all battling amongst ourselves for survival. We shouldn't be here, with our fans and the players we have, how are we here? Mike Ashley is your answer but nows not the time for blaming people as the players have been dreadful on many occasions too.

3 wins can save us we think. 9 points in St.James' against Portsmouth, Middlesbrough and Fulham. The big question is asked though, can we win 3 straight games when we've only one 6 all season? It's a question that remains to be answered. We should really in theory with the players we have. Viduka is back and Mr.Joey Barton will be returning to the fray too which is good to hear. Maybe Joey will battle us out of where we are. Martins, Owen, Carroll, Viduka, surely there's goals there? We can only hope and pray as I've said many a time. We need to be optimistic but my optimism is being drained each game. Come on lads, keep this great club afloat because one thing's for sure, you are being paid enough to do so.
