###Â Guthrie - Injured tonight in reserve game

Well just as things seem to get better, they get worse. A reserve game tonight saw Danny Guthrie hobble off and putting a damper on the result tonight. Danny Guthrie is a very important member of Newcastle's relegation plans and is one of the faster center midfielders we have at the time being. Joey Barton is expected to make some sort of return in the near future but it seems, should Guthrie have injured himself seriously, that we'll be left with Nicky Butt and Kevin Nolan in the center of the park. No offence to either, but neither of them possess a great deal of pace that we need at this stage of the season.

In the same game Andy Carroll stated to the onlooking Alan Shearer that he may deserve a start on Saturday v Stoke, grabbing both Newcastle goals tonight. Some news is still unclear over the Xisco scenario though. Reports suggest he too could be injured but there has been no official report released by Newcastle as of yet. Let's hope it isn't too serious although we can't really see Xisco playing a major part in the season finale. Either way we don't want injuries heading into the most important season ending we've had in many many years. Let's hope we can survive and look forward to a bright future
