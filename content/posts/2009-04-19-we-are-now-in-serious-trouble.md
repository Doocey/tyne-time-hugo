### Shearer - Made adventurous substitutions todayÃŸÃŸ

We are in serious trouble now, lying far off safety and and other loss underneath our belts. Today we went to Tottenham, and inform Tottenham who were in sublime form coming into this match. From the first minute you could see Spur's confidence on the ball, passing it about cleanly and easily. We had a few got phases of passing too but the stray ball signaled the tension with the Newcastle players. Spurs pressed, we conceded and what a bad goal to give away. A poor first attempt by Bent manages to fall perfectly to his feet again where he slotted home on the second attempt. A real sucker punch.

Gutierrez, Carroll and Steven Taylor all made returns to the side with David Edgar and Ameobi missing out. Carroll didn't have much of an effect as he was being well marked by Dawson and as for Owen, well he didn't get the service. Shearer made an odd substitution on the HT mark, bringing local lad Steven Taylor off Alan Smith, later to bring on Viduka and Martins for Carroll and Nolan. We nearly equalized too, a fine ball over the top saw Martins onside and a good touch gave him the chance to shoot. Unfortunately he slipped and it blazed over the bar, indeed that was to be our last chance.

We have Portsmouth next at St.James', anything short of a win would be a disaster. We are serious trouble but the belief is still there, those 3 home games are our only hope. We can only hope and pray for 3 wins and any other points that come along the way. 5 games left and second bottom. We need points, and fast. If we are to save this mighty club and all it's great fans we need to start winning, and even that mightn't be enough.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
