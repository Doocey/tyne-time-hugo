### Fans - Have endured a torrid time this season

It's sad that it has came down to 3 must win games. If we have stability at the club and a permanent manager, we'd be midtable, easily. However we're in a really tough relegation battle which coudl well go down to teh last day of teh season. I have no problem if it goes down to the last day just as long as it doesn't decide our furture and we're safe by then. It seems West Brom are on their way down, Middlesbrough are tipped to go as well and the next spot is hanging in the balance. It could go to us, Hull, Blacbkburn or even Sunderland. We are favorites to go down out of that list unfortunately.

Hull are in free-fall with Liverpool next, Blackburn should survive with Wigan next at home. Sunderland are expected to stay up with their next trip to the Hawthorns v West Brom. For us it's Portsmouth at the theatre that is St.James' Park. 3 points is the only positive thing we can get out of that game. Saying that, 3 points might be still of little value, especially if Middesbrough manage to beat Arsenal on Sunday. After Arseal for Boro, it's United. It will make or break the Riverside team. Of course we play them straight after United and hopefully, get all three points. It's three must wins at home for us.

For Hull who could well go down after such a bright start to the season, face Liverpool, Villa and Stoke in their next 3 games. A tough run in, with United the last fixture on the calendar for them. We have a chance to get safe, and we need to take it. Sunderland next three fixtures are West Brom, Everton and Bolton, we wouldn't be surprised if they managed to nip 6 points out of them. Although a rescue mission seems lost and it mightn't be much concern to us, West Brom's next 3 opponents are Sunderland,Tottenham and Wigan. Pretty tough test.Â 

So there we have it. Three straight wins is a must to have a chance of survival and three victories should in their be enough to save our ship. Can we get 9 points? Up to you lads, we've given you all the support we can throughout the season and no doubt St.James' Park will be full to the rafters for the 3 home games which will seal our fate. Come on lads! Keep us in the Premier League.
