Newcastle United have issued an official statement on Joe Kinnear’s bypass surgery tomorrow.

Newcastle United can confirm that manager Joe Kinnear will undergo a triple heart bypass operation tomorrow.

Joe was admitted to hospital on Saturday morning in the Midlands after reporting of feeling unwell at the team’s hotel ahead of the game at West Bromwich Albion.

Tests have since confirmed Joe requires surgery, after which he will need to rest for a period of at least eight weeks.

Joe said:

_“I’ve really appreciated all the get well messages I’ve received from people over the last week and I’d like to thank everyone who has been in touch.”

Managing Director Derek Llambias said:

“I am sure the whole football community will join Newcastle United in wishing Joe a speedy recovery.”_

Chris Hughton and Colin Calderwood will continue to take charge of first team football affairs at the Club.

We wish Joe the very best of luck and hope the luck of the Irish is on his and indeed Newcastle's side 🙂

Comments appreciated 🙂
