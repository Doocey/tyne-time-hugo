![James Perch celebrates after scoring for Newcastle United at Old Trafford](https://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/James-Perch-Manchester-United.jpg "Perch - Put Newcastle United ahead against Manchester United last time out")

A trip to Old Trafford is always a daunting task, and more often than not teams leave with little or no points - never mind all three. The last time the travelling Magpies made the trip down to Manchester to face what was then Alex Ferguson's side in the Premier League - Javier Hernandez proved the thorn in the Magpies' side as the Mexican scored at the death to secure all three points in a thrilling 4-3 fixture. It had all started so well with James Perch scoring his only ever goal for Newcastle from close range, a memory which he told me he'd cherish for the rest of career when I interviewed him earlier this year, before his move to Wigan  Athletic.

Well here we are again, Manchester United v Newcastle United and the Toon are in a much better state heading to the 'Theatre of Dreams' then last time out. Pardew will be encouraged by Everton's victory on away soil during the week, and after suffering a drab 0-3 defeat to Swansea, the men in Black and White will be looking to make amends this afternoon, and no better place to do it than Old Trafford.

The real question beckons, can NUFC get a result, or all three points against Moyes' men today? Can Rémy and co. outscore them?

Well, whatever happens, every important kick, save, goal and incident from Old Trafford will be brought to you _live_ below this very paragraph should you be unable to source a visual of the game. Stay tuned for the pre-match build-up and the match action itself.

You don't even need to refresh the page, all updates will appear in front of you. Sit back relax, and hopefully we'll be celebrating a result at the end of the 90!
