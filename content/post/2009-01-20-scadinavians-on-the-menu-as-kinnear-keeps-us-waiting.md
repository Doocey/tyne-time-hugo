## Raitala - Ajax and Newcastle both interested

If it it's not John Arne Riise or Per Ciljan Skjelbred it's another Scandinavian lot, Jukka Raitala is latest lad on trial at NUFC and he has reportedly made some encouraging signs, perhaps enough for us to sign him. Kinnear has said that these will go to the youth squad and not feature for the Seniors however you'd find it hard to see this 20 year old settle for the Reserves. Joe Kinnear has told so many stories of transfer speculation, possible loans, possible M'Bia and that time about Barry Ferguson, whether Kinnear is acting as a puppet for the backroom team or not it is getting very frustrating to be a fan at this time. We need signings and Kinnear himself has made this clear to Ashley, but the question is has/will Ashley fund this window as well as the summer?

As far as it's known, we've more than a couple lads in on trial and it may be the only type of transfer we see coming to the Toon, future ones. I for one am an amid fan of youth production, Villa are a perfect example with Gabby Agbonlahor etc but we need first teamers ahead of these. It is important to have a youth scheme but even more important to maintain our Premier League status. Fans are growing with discomfort that no real signings will be made this January and that our fate could lay away from the EPL but all I can say is to keep the faith and we could have a pleasant surprise coming our way, something in the form of Jonas GutierrÃ©z would do, thanks very much ðŸ˜€
