### Taylor - Out of action for a considerable amount of time

After yesterdays defeat to a rejuvenated Nottingham Forest side, we were shown yet again, that there is a massive need for new arrivals at St.James' Park. The latest reports are, that Steven Taylor could be out of action for up to 4-6 weeks. As you probably know by now, Shola Ameobi is also injured and won't be returning till early Christmas. With Mike Ashley likely to stay  on as owner, you really do wonder if he'll loosen his purse strings and give Chris some cash to spend, because we already know that he's willing to give Hughton the job after today's interview.

We really do need about four new players minimum. The likes of Danny Simpson and Marlon Harewood have been good acquisitions but we need more. A new centre-half, midfielder, winger and a striker would be preferable but who is on offer?

It's more than likely that if we are to sign anyone, it will be on loan, just like Marlon and Danny, but a loan deal is better than nothing. We could perhaps try for the likes of Darron Gibson, or Craig Cathcart again.

The Coca Cola Championship is a dogfight and we need to be prepared. There are a few Toon players that have already played in the Championship in the shape of Harewood, Guthrie and indeed even Andy Carroll. If we are to be near the play-offs then we need a huge effort, and in numbers.

Our next game is away to Scunthorpe which will no doubt prove to be a tricky affair following their win at the weekend. We need the clubs future sorted out though, and fast.
