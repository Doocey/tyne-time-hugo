### Duff - Biggest game in his career

The time is ticking towards the Middlesbrough game, when the whistle sounds at St.James' the nail biting will have begun, on both sets of fans. This is without a doubt the biggest game Newcastle United have played in 16 years of football on Tyneside. Who thought that such a well supported side that used challenge for all major trophys , would be stuck in the thick of a relegation battle. Damien Duff is well aware of the possible outcomes of this game and certainly knows that we can;'t lose it

Duff said :

> “This game is huge and we’re going to need all of the fans right behind us again.
>
> “It doesn’t come much bigger for me personally – it’s one of the biggest games I’ve been involved with in my whole career.”
>
> “We went to Anfield on Sunday believing we could get a draw at least, so it was very disappointing from that point of view.
>
> “But we’re geared up for next Monday now.
>
> “I thought we deserved to win against Portsmouth, but we just got a point.
>
> “Now we know exactly what we have to do against Middlesbrough.”

When asked about previous incidents in his career, he touched on his Blackburn days.

> “I got relegated with Blackburn. I’m not sure how many of the other lads in the dressing room have, but it’s not a nice feeling to have, and it was the lowest point of my career.
>
> “I don’t want it to happen again, so I’ll be doing everything I can, and I’m sure the other lads will as well, to keep us up.”

It's very evident too that Shearer has been a big hit with the players to this date.

> “Since the gaffer has come in, it has been great. He’s given the whole place a lift, and it would be nice to get a win for him.
>
> “Training and everything else has been brilliant, and obviously having him around has been great. He’s a hero of mine.
>
> “The spirit’s definitely still there.”

We all know the importance of the Boro game, if we lose we're definitely going down, if we win there is still some hope.

Comments appreciated 🙂
