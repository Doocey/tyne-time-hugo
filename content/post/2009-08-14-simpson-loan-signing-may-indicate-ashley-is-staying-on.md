When you see loan signings coming to Newcastle you might, first of all, surprised that we have even attempted to sign a player or secondly there has been some development in the sale of the club. However, I wouldn't get  too excited as I think it could mean something far worse, Ashley staying on at Newcastle and regaining control of our club for another season. Sky Sports have just announced that David O'Leary is out of the running (Good) and that the post is still under consideration. Who now though? Are they holding off for Joe Kinnear and are ready to appoint him as soon as his health gets the green light?

Unfortunately the fact that O'Leary is out of the running means he was more than likely contacted over taking the club for the season and that's not good at all. We have to wait and see what will happen over the course of the day because today, Friday was the day Barry Moat was meant to have deposited the Â£25m into Mike Ashley's account and as good as, complete the takeover of our beleaguered club. I'll be keeping you updated in hope that we get some positive news, signing Danny Simpson is somewhat positive but of course probably means the dreaded.
