![Harewood - Looked sharp yesterday](http://i36.tinypic.com/359n4fb.jpg)

Not long ago we had Michael Owen, one of the worlds most famous footballer, lining out in the Black and White of Newcastle United but after a rather dismal turn in events (relegation) Owen left, for the better we think. Yesterday the vacant #10 jersey was sported by Newcastle's new signing, Marlon Harewood, on loan from Aston Villa. It quite an interesting turn around at  Newcastle, as it seems Chris has filled the vacant positions, left behind by high paid 'stars', with determined players who want the very best for Newcastle United and their mighty fans.

Newcastle bear Roy Keane's weak side by four goals to nil, and mind you, it could've been a lot more than that should Newcastle had the likes of Joey Barton, Jonas Gutierrez or even Shola Ameobi. However, it was a polished performance from the lads all the same.

A sublime hat-trick from Kevin Nolan made him the MOTM and indeed Newcastle United's top goal scorer, playing as a deep striker or an AM. His two headers were good, but the first,of real quality. All credit is due to Ryan Taylor's fine cross as well.

Ryan Taylor then scored a scorcher himself in what was surely a shot, his celebration indicating that the goal was 100% his. Nile Ranger played a big role in Nolan's hat-trick nodding down for the Liverpudlian and Ranger nearly got one of his Owen, only for the keeper to pull off a good save.

So it's good to see we're picked up since the performance against Plymouth but we'll face a tough test in the shape of QPR next, in St.James' Park. Big thanks to Chris for doing a very good job and to the players, as they begin their pay back to the fans.
