### Gomis - Toon look to Frenchman again?

A major flush of stories have come through the press today with Newcastle having confirmed their interest in Stephane M'Bia and placing a bid of Â£5m. It would be hard to believe if this bid is accepted never mind the player wanting to come to St.James'. His club, Rennes are 3rd in the French league and questions have been asked whether he would be interested in swapping that for a big club in a competitive relegation battle. If Stephane does decide to move it would be a fantastic signing to say the least, 6'2 and strong, he would boss the midfield we'd like to think ðŸ˜€ Everton has been after the Cameroonian for some time now though and reports in the summer was that an Â£8m had been rejected, mind you that would have been more that â‚¬8m euros at that time too!

Most of the Toon fans are expecting a disappointment with teh bid being rejected but even if it was accepted, what would convince him to move? Wages? I certainly doubt it, it is good to see our recruitment team working at it though and being linked with these players, very good ones with big futures ðŸ™‚ Questions would be asked of who would be making room for M'Bia though? Would it be Barton or maybe it won't be anybody which is certainly the outcome I would be hoping for. Geremi's departure is 'dragging' on a little which isn't great to see but hopefully he'l soon complete the move and free up some cash, as little as it may be.

Lucas Neill on the other hand is anotherÂ Toon target, the Australian is reported to have agreed with NUFC that he will join the Magpies, if Kinnear as the team buy out his remaining contract at West Ham. Wages at West Ham would be nothing short of high and the fee that it would cost to terminate his remaining year may be spent elsewhere, on another Bassong if you so please ðŸ™‚ Anxiety has crept into Newcastle as Kinnear's no nonsense transfer window approach, which includes naming the players he has bid for and indeed how much. Information like this can be released <em>after</em> the player has joined Joe, otherwise we might get Spurs sniffing around again like they did for Woodgate, Modric, Hutton etc. Now e we don't want that do we? ðŸ˜€ Time will tell of signings here in Newcastle and I'll be here to inform you ðŸ™‚

Comments appreciated
