![Xisco will depart Tyneside this Summer](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00979/xisco_979491c.jpg)

First of all, a huge congratulations to Newcastle United for winning the Coca Cola Championship and indeed lifting it at St.James' Park today in front of a massive 52,000 fans. The attendance puts Sunderland's and indeed many more Premier League club's to shame and just shows what a footballing town Newcastle Upon-Tyne really is. Before the match, Chris Hughton  announced that Xisco would not be in his plans for the upcoming Premier League campaign and he indeed expects the Spaniard to move on.

It's disappointing to see Xisco moving on so quickly, mainly because he was never given a chance to prove his worth at the club. He arrived in very controversial circumstances and arrived at the club without the managers permission.

From Xisco signing, we've saw Keegan resign, Dennis Wise leave his role and Newcastle United relegated to the Coca Cola Championship. However, after a loan stint at Racing, which has so far seen him get 2 goals in nearly twenty appearances, Xisco is set to return the again, Premier League side.

Speaking to the Journal, Hughton said :

> _'He's a player we were prepared to let go a year ago,'_
>
> _'I don't see much has changed since then._ _

>_ _'We'll see whether he wants to remain in Spain. He's contracted to us, so if he did come back he'd be a Newcastle player and we'd judge him on the merits of what we saw.'_

Mike Ashley dished out Â£5.75m for this lad but there's reports that if he plays one more game for Newcastle we'll have to hand over the full amount, or something of the likes. His transfer to Newcastle brought a lot of confusion and dare I say it, grief.

That said, I think he could be quite a good striker give the chance. He could well score goals for Newcastle and who knows, could revel up-front in the upcoming Premier League season. I just feel we haven't given him a chance and for nearly Â£6m, he's need to be given one.

Who knows though, as Hughton himself has said, there prepared to let him go at the earliest opportunity.

Anyway, what a great day for Newcastle United FC, the fans, the city and indeed North-East football. We're back up in the Premier League and have finally lifted a trophy, after years of waiting. We're also back to challenge Sunderland for North-East supremacy and even better, we'll be meeting Hull City on the way down ðŸ˜€

On a side note, it's ironic to see Iain Dowie being partly responsible for bringing two side down into the Coca Cola Championship. AH well, he tried, let's not worry about it eh?
