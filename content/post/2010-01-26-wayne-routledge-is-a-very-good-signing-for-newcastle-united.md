### Routledge - a Very good signing for the Toon Army is you ask me

It's surprise news to say the least to hear that Newcastle have signed Wayne Routledge from QPR today and very good news if you ask me. The winger has signed a reported 3 and a half deal on Tyneside and for a fee of Â£1m, which if true, is very good value. Routledge as you might remember was a Tottenham and Villa former and an exciting winger. Watching him for QPR onÂ  many occasions, I think he has real potential on Tyneside and it's a very good capture by Toon boss Chris Hughton.

_Sky Sports_ are running the story that he has signed but it's official news, as stated on Newcastle's website. However, we're led to believe that, by many a source, Â the fee is Â£1m. I for one am excited about the prospect of Routledge.

He has a record of playing a season or two at a few clubs, Fulham, Palace, Villa and now QPR to name a few, but I'm confident Chris Hughton can get the best of the lad who has been hampered by injuries in seasons gone by.

We are meant to seal a deal for Mike Williamson today too which will be good going for Hughton and co. Interest in Everton's Jame Vaughan also seems to be mounting with news that he could well arrive at Newcastle too.

Anyway, Routledge is a surprise signing and a nice surprise at that. It's not often we've had them at Newcastle.
