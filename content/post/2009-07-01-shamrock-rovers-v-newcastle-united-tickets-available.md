### Tickets - Available for Toon fans

Newcastle's first pre-season test will come at Shamrock Rovers on the 11th of July. Newcastle have a strong Irish  following or apparently so. Me being one of them :D. However the ticket prices aren't a ridiculous fee and quite reasonable especially for any Irish Newcastle followers. Indeed I might take the 4 hour journey to Tallagh in Dublin myself to see the boys in action. However I'm not purchasing a ticket just yet, at least until we know what's happening Â regards Alan Shearer and the players. If Shearer is appointed I'll be there supporting the lads in black and white stripes, not green ones.

Ticket Details :

**Shamrock Rovers v Newcastle United

** Pre-Season Friendly

Saturday, 11th July, 2009, Kick-off: 3:00pm

Tickets available from :

Prices are a reasonable Â£13 which isn't too bad, especially if Shearer is in charge and we have new ownership.

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
