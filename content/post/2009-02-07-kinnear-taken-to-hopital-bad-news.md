### Kinnear - Will be missed in the dressing room today

Bad news today, Joe Kinnear has fallen ill just before the West Brom game and will not be at it, as he is in hospital. It is a major blow to the team as he is a great orator in the dressing room, whether Chris Hughton can get the same from the players is yet to be seen but today's game is certainly a game we need to win. Losing Kinnear for this one is a big loss. The starting line up is still uncertain and news that Martins is back, he should really start. Big game, big three points, come on lads, do it for Joe ðŸ™‚

Get well soon Joe ðŸ™‚
