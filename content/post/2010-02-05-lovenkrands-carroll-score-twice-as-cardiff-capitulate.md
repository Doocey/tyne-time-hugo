### Lovenkrands - Came off the bench to score twice including a beauty on his left

First of all, I was very wrong in my predictions about tonights game. Very wrong indeed. In what was a totally one sided affair from the very first whistle, Newcastle United fired 5 goals past Dave Jones side. An early opener from Andy Carroll followed by an unfortunate turn of events which saw Gyepes put the ball into his own net, with Andy Carroll again to thank. Only a few  minutes later Carroll has grabbed his official second, a great cross from Danny Simpson onto the head of Carroll who fired home.

Three to nothing within 15 minutes., a marvelous feat for a side who hadn't scored 5, in the last three matches. DÃ©butante, Leon Best was in Carroll's shadow for most of the game but did get his name on the sheet, with a yellow card.

Lovenkrands who replaced Best had an immediate impact, shooting one into the back of the net within minutes of his arrival and topped his tally and indeed Newcastle's to 5, with a sublime curler on his left peg. A strike Alan Shearer would be proud of.

So there we are, we needed a win and we got one, in emphatic fashion. The lads did great tonight and none less than the new-boys and indeed Jonas Gutierrez who somewhat milked his ovation on his way to the bench.

The signs are good and we're doing very well as is. The fans will surely be happy to see we've scored five against a side that are looking themselves, for promotion come May.

Long may this free scoring continue, and long may we see St.James' Park erupt in sheer joy as the Geordie faithful watch their own hammer the opposition.

However this is only the Championship remember! Still, what a good what to start the weekend.
