### NUFC - Second loss in a row in the second tier of English football

Yesterday Newcastle slumped to their second successive defeat on the road in the Coca Cola Championship. After going behind from some poor defending, we managed to equalise through Kevin Nolan, and it was a very good goal indeed, Premier League quality to be fair. However, we dropped out of the game again and conceded again with ten minutes remaining. After some  petty pressure the final whistle sounded and Newcastle are now no longer on top of the division. What makes it worse is the fact only about half the players seemed bothered.

Indeed we must say one of the players was Argentina's finest in Jonas Gutierrez who of late, has a habit of shooting, any time he gets the ball in a decent area. We're sure it'll come off at some stage Jonas.

The main thing about this loss is we have been proved yet again that there is need for huge changes at the club, and it must start at the top, ie. owner Mike Ashley. It's time he left, but it seems as if Barry Moat can raise the cash to buy him out, and as for Sheard and his consortium, I'll let you finish that one.

It seems that Shearer will be looking elsewhere to get into management although we're pretty sure he was always open to offers. Whether Chris will take the permanent job is another thing but needless to say, we need a big shift in things.

If we can sort ourselves out, like getting a definite owner, a permanent manager and some new players who want to fight for the badge on their shirt, then we could challenge for the play-offs but how long have we been saying this for? Far too long.
