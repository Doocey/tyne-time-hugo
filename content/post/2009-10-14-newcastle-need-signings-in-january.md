### Hughton - Rumoured to have nothing to spend in January

Lee Ryder has today posted an article claiming that Chris Hughton will have no transfer funds to spend this January. Hughton, who has led Newcastle to the top of the Coca Cola Championship table and virtually sorted NUFC out on the pitch, was hoping to strengthen in the coming transfer window. However, news is emerging that Ashley, who saved a handsome penny in the  Keegan scenario, is unwilling to hand over a few million to the every loyal Chris Hughton.

As my headline suggests, we need new faces. Injuries have already set in and we're not that far into the new season. At least three new players are needed, a defender or two, and certainly a midfielder.

Reports today also suggested that we failed with an approach for Andy O'Brien earlier in the year but his wages were too big of an obstacle for Mike Ashley and co. to handle.

Malmo FC also refuted reports that striker Edward Ofere was subject to an offer from Newcastle but hinted they may be willing to part services if the fee is right, and indeed that fee is rumoured to be about Â£2m.

All in all, we can't get through the whole season with the squad we have, we need new players. The youngsters are playing their part but some new faces are need. Should we get them, then we might just prove tougher come May 2010.

Comments welcome.
