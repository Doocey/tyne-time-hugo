### Sir Bobby - An emotional ceremony in Durham Cathedral

An emotional ceremony in Durham Cathedral some of the greats of English and European football pay their never ending respects to the late Sir Bobby Robson. In a gathering, in the fine Durham cathedral saw the Newcastle first team, alongside Chris Hughon, Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne, Peter Beardsley, Gary Lineker, and Fabio Capello all attend. It was an emotional event  for Gazza who was reduced to tears but most people within the sacred grounds couldn't help but feel they had a lost a great great man.

Today Newcastle are away to Peterborough, Darren Ferguson's well organised team who got their first win of the Coca Cola Championship on Saturday, even after falling 2 nil behind.

Although the cup is probably the least of our worries, it always nice to progress to the latter stages and maybe even make it to Wembley.

Losing tonight wouldn't be the end of the world and would mean most concentration would be on the league, and perhaps the forthcoming FA Cup. Peterborough will be up for this game and their 12th man, the crowd will do their best to ensure a 'giant-killing'.

However, this performance should be for Sir Bobby and everything he's done for English football and indeed in Europe. Saying that, there's no need for a strenuous effort but a night to be remembered wouldn't be refused either.
