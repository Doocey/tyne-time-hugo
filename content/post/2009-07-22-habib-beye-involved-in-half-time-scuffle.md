### Beye - Fighting for Newcastle in every sense

In a one nil victory  over Huddersfield Town, in which Kevin Nolan scored the winner, Habib Beye was involved in a HT bust-up with Huddersfield Town captain Peter Clarke. It's not fully clear what happened in the tunnel but it's understood Beye nor Clarke were too happy about each other. Indeed it must have been something quite big as Fabricio Coloccini was too involved in a confrontation after the final whistle. It's a third successive win for Newcastle United on the trot and credit is due to the players, who don't know where their future, or the future of the clue lies at the moment.

Kevin Nolan scored the only goal of the game and celebrated to the away fans that did make the journey. the fans have been brilliant in pre-season, in Ireland and indeed in Darlington where over 4,000 traveled to watch their 'heroes' in action. Now if there was ever proof that we are the best fans in the land that is it. A relegated team full of over-paid earners, ownerless and in need of a manager, yet we support them all the same. Would we see that anywhere else? I think not. Anyways, we'll be waiting another day or a week it seems before anything's resolved.
