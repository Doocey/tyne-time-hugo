###Â Pato - Perhaps just a little unrealistic?

OK, we might not attract Alexandre Pato to St.James' Park but we certainly do hope that new faces arrive on Tyneside this January. I know a lot of you'll will immediately play down our chances of signing anyone <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">good</span> **permanently** you just never know, we might be surprised this Christmas period, although I wouldn't get too excited. Reports emerged today that Ashley could  hand Chris Hughton a possible Â£6m transfer kitty, and that Adam Hammill is on Hughton's wish-list. I really don't know what's more believable, Â£6m budget or signing Adam Hammill!

Hughton has yet to decide on Marlon Harewood, but honestly, the majority of you who commented on yesterdays article were in favour on the 'Beast' staying on Tyneside.

The days of being linked with the Miguel Veloso's and Luka Modric's are gone and gone for some time we think. If that means the days of huge wage bills for treatment table players are also gone, then I'll be more than happy.

Besides that, I think that Chris could bring in a couple of faces, on loan if we're lucky. Danny Simpson looks set to move permanently but whether in January, or the Summer, we'll just have to see.

Somehow I can't see Gonzalo HiguaÃ­nÂ arriving any time soon!
