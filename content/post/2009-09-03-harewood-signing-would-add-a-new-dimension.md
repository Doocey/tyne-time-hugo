###Â Harewood - Reportedly joining Newcastle next week

Well, I'm back from holidays in the Algarve, albeit a little sunburnt but the good news is, Newcastle United are top of the Coca Cola Championship with Chris Hughton doing a great job. A rather great goal from 'Dan the man Guthrie' saw us through Leicester with Nile Ranger showing signs of a very good future striker. Steve Howard caused a few problems to our defence but  Jose Enrique, Steven Taylor and co. did a pretty decent job. We've Cardiff next, in the Welsh capital and we'll really need to be on top form to overcome Dave Jones's side.

Following another pretty overrated anticipated transfer window, Newcastle signed Peter Lovenkrands on a free, and that kept the Toon faithful somewhat pleased. Personally I think it's a no brainer of a signing and that a new forward, with a little pace and flair, in the lower tiers of English football is always a good thing.

With Harewood, we'd get a large work rate and a fair few goals at Championship level. He's a very physical player and things at Villa just didn't work out. We can't ignore the face that he's 30 and naturally, peaking or on a downward spiral but if we manage to sign him on loan then it would be more than decent business from Chris and crew.

Craig Cathcart is also rumoured to be signing following the report that we had an initial bid rejected from the Northern Irish defender and he would also we a very good acquisition. We're still waiting on any news from the takeover scenario but the focus on that,. from the fans has eased a little, mainly because the lads are relieving us of some pressure on the field.

Comments welcome
