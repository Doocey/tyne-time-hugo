It all set for action. Shay Given our best keeper, a consistent performer, is undergoing a medical at Manchester City. After Newcastle 1-5 loss at Liverpool Given hasn't been happy since and it seems after a long deliberation that both clubs have agreed a fee, in the region of Â£8m If the fee is just Â£8m alone most Toon fans will be raging, including myself. Hopefully though it includes a couple of good players (Elano and Onohua) or else Man City have got an absolute steal for the best keeper in the Premier League.

The transfer has yet to be completed but it is not top of Newcastle fans agenda yet, the Tyne Wear Derby is. 1.30 it will all kick off, Mike Ashley will be present and so will 50,000 odd fans. This is our day, the day to turn the tables and let it be the start of a much needed boost.
