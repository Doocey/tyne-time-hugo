### Hall - Good to some depth on the defensive side of things with Fitz

It's been a long time since I can say I'm quite happy with the transfer window. This time last year we signed Kevin Nolan and Ryan Taylor. Today we signed another two players in Fitz Hall &Â Patrick van Aanholt, to add to our 3 signings already. Although they're only two loan signings, they're our players for a while and that's the most important. Chris Hughton has witnessed  first hand, the injuries that ruined an already beleaguered Newcastle United side and has obviously picked up a few tips on the way to becoming the permanent manager of the Magpies.

Fitz Hall will come in for back-up with Steven Taylor injured however, I'm sure he'll find it rather tough to get his way into a side with the likes of Mike Williamson making a good first impression.

Speaking about his two loan signings, Hughton said :

> 'Fitz is a player we have known about for a long time and is very experienced.
>
> 'We wanted to bring in two centre-backs but also wanted two different types of player.
>
> 'We have Fabricio Coloccini and Mike, who did very well on his debut, and now Fitz.
>
> 'He is very good on the ground and has got good pace.

Also, Chris Hughton has outlined his interest in Victor Moses and hopes that he can make the lad a Newcastle United player before the window closes. If we could get Moses, and for a decent fee then heads will begin to turn in Mike Ashley's favour. This is a first in Ashley tenure where we've signed players up in the space of days.
>
> 'It's been documented that we are very interested in signing the lad,'

> 'Most people are also aware of the circumstances with Crystal Palace and the situation they are in, and we hope to make progress on that over the next couple of days.

> 'It's one we have a very, very keen interest in.'

Apparently though, Moses is waiting for a call from Real Madrid and is hoping that the Bernabeu men will make a bid for his services. The lure of playing with some of the best players in the world and living the life in sunny Spain would be irresistible for any footballer.

However, I'm hoping that we can nip in before any other clubs register interest, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see Sunderland making their way into the fray.
