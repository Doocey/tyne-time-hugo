### Taylor - Scored a nice goal today but disappointment with result

When we heard Geovanni had scored after 8 minutes we all sank into our seats. It was the worst start we could get off to and even the fact Blackburn conceded early on it didn't cheer me up. I knew there was time to score but I hoped that a second Hull goal wasn't on the horizon. Geovanni came close to getting a second too but 7 minutes from half time local lad Steven Taylor equalised and couldn't have done it at a better time, 1-1 HT as we all hoped for a good and more importantly an improved second half performance from our team and we got that, only problem is, we didn't capitalise and get a winner.

We needed the win without a doubt and Hull wanted it to give them some breathing room. It was a tight contest and hence the draw however once again we fail to maintain the stamina and commitment from previous games like at United last week. Luckily all results went our way today and we still remain 1 above the bottom three with Arsenal next up. I have a good feeling about the Arsenal game as Beye, Guthrie and Duff could all well return which is a warm surprise. We have a decent record against Arsenal at home with Taylor scoring last year when Big Sam was in charge (How things have changed!) It we get a win against Arsenal who drubbed Blackburn 4-0 today then we could give ourselves a few hours breathing space ðŸ™‚
