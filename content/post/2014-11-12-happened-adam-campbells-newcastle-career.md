As Newcastle United supporters begrudgingly prepare for the dreaded international break, it gives us all time to look back on what has been a superb return to form. 5 straight victories, including four successive Premier League wins has left Toon fans wondering where it all went right. The majority will heap praise on manager Alan Pardew for turning things around, but when I say majority, I mean the media and onlookers outside of the north-east. Truth is, plenty of Newcastle fans - myself included - would have Pardew replaced in the morning if given the choice, however we are all smart enough to realise that once he retained Mike Ashley's backing following a dire loss to Stoke City, his sacking just wasn't going to happen. Anyway, in a season so far that has been filled with local lads giving their all for the Black and White cause, I want to take a look at another Geordie in **Adam Campbell**, and ask the question - what has happened to this guy?

Before you interject and cite his recent hernia and the fact he has just returned to regular, full-on training - I know, but there is something more to his story than just that injury.

Many will remember [Papiss Cissé's last-gasp winner against Stoke City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FuFG_AEcRo "papiss cisse goal stoke city") two seasons ago, a no-nonsense finish to say the least. However, it may well be forgotten that  Adam Campbell had an influential role in the goal. He collected it before feeding Sylvain Marvueax (remember him?!) who in turn setup Cisse for the winner with a stunning assist to be fair.

Campbell had a couple of other appearances throughout the season, and it should also be noted that he was again involved in another last-gasp Cissé winner, this time against Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League. It was Sylvain Marveaux who set that one up too, in case you're wondering.

He has had loan spells at Carlisle United and St. Mirren since, but has only appeared 12 times combined, netting just two goals in the process. It was followed by a one month loan at Fleetwood Town this August - again, to little joy.

Interestingly, I believe I remember reading comments from St. Mirren's manager suggesting that the youngster wasn't showing 'passion' for the game. If anyone can find those quotes, be sure to link it in the comments section.

Had Adam fallen away just when it seemed that the future was bright and he was about to seize a first team opportunity?

I just pose the question out of curiosity, because he seems to have disappeared off the radar quite quickly, and hasn't commanded any real presence in the lower leagues during loan spells. Bear in mind he is only 19 years-old so there's plenty of time, but really - what has happened to his NUFC career?
