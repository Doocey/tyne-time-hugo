A win's a win and we're just happy to get all three points today. Far from a polished performance from a Newcastle United team saw us overcome a pretty lame Plymouth effort, to say the least. We started the game well with Steven Taylor heading home, but only from absolutely dire defending from Paul Sturrock's side. However, we should've wrapped  the game up by the first half with all the chances we had. Argyle seemed lifeless and we seemed as if we'd ran 6 miles before the game. A couple of arguments also occurred, with Peter Lovenkrands involved in both. Not nice to see but Argyle's equaliser hit another level.

Luckily Danny Guthrie and Nile Ranger were ready to come in and they made an instant impact. Guthrie assisted Kevin Nolan for the lead and Andy Carroll's goal all but sealed it up. It was important to get all three points and luckily we did that, albeit in probably the most boring game since Sam Allardyce's stunt on Tyneside.

We're currently second now, behind West Brom who trounced local rivals Middlesbrough. If we can keep the wins up and the sale of the club nearly completed, then we may just have a chance to bounce back to where we belong at first attempt, the Premier League.
