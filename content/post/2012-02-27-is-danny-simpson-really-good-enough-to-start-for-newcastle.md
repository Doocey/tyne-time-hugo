![Danny Simpson in action for Newcastle United against Fulham](http://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Danny-Simpson-Newcastle.jpg "Danny-Simpson-Newcastle-United")

#### Simpson - Starting to shows signs of becoming a quite average right-back

You would have to credit Danny Simpson with the fantastic point Newcastle United managed at Old Trafford against Manchester United earlier in the season, after he clawed what seemed a net destined header, off the line. In fact, his position on the line has saved Newcastle United goals this season. However, it seems to me that with every game that passes - Simpson looks increasingly  average and surely isn't one of the first names on Alan Pardew's matchday teamsheet? He is a vulnerability down the right - often getting caught out of position, and failing to keep pace with some of the tricky wingers he has come up against this season. Add to that the news that he will not sign a new and improved contract, which more than doubles his current wage. I think it's time to move Danny on, while we can.

Our RB position isn't one where there is an awful lot of competition to be fair - Simpson has played any time he's been fit, which is a bit worrying. He did have a great Championship season, and a solid Premier League campaign last time out but there are better players than him out there, for reasonable prices.

Whether the reported personal problems in his life are affecting his performances I'm not quite sure and it's none our business. However, once he walks over the white line - then you expect 100%, and for him to leave any private life issues in he dressing-room (but nowhere near Cheik). With that said - a lot of people have complained about Simpson since last season, claiming that he is no more than a nPower Championship defender at best. That is a tad harsh, but I'm not sure he is good enough to start for Newcastle United any longer.

Nathaniel Clyne is a summer target, and enquiries will be made when the window re-opens - you can be sure of that.

However, depending on the asking price; NUFC may turn their attentions to France (for a change) with Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa a likely target. The Central African Republic born player can play anywhere across the back four, which would be a welcomed addition to Alan Pardew's squad.

As well as that - James Tavernier is reportedly highly rated among the Newcastle hierarchy, and we could see him in action in a Black and White shirt before too long, and perhaps after he returns from his loan.

Of course added to Tavernier - Ryan Taylor can play in the RB position, but I doubt that we will see the Englishman slot in there unless injuries hit us hard, and we certainly hope that doesn't happen.

Maybe it's a bit harsh on Danny, and he might just be going through a bad patch at the minute, but in my _professional_ opinion at least - he needs to at least face competition for that right-back position.

What do you guys think? Does he merit his starting place?
