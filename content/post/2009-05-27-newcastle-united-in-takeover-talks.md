![Ashley - Looking to sell Newcastle United](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/1/6/1231281550034/Mike-Ashley-001.jpg)

News has broken today, that Mike Ashley and his leading men are in talks with an unnamed consortium over the possible takeover of Newcastle United Football Club. After a dreadful season and the worst the club could suffer, relegation Mike Ashley yesterday apologized to the Newcastle faithful for his terrible ownership and today

[Sky Sports][1] reported that Ashley is looking to sell following the relegation. Indeed Ashley's bank account is shrinking by the day with Newcastle United and it's best for both parties that he sells, a new start for Newcastle United and a financial break for Mike Ashley himself.

This is great news for Anti-Ashley parties and I would be happy to see him go too. Although there is a element of sympathy towards Ashley and the amount of money he has invested with no return, he has inevitably sent Newcastle down to teh Coca Cola Championship. Imagine a new ownership, a new start. New regimes etc, could rekindle Newcastle's great history again.

More to follow.
