####Â Rosales - A possible replacement for the departing Danny Simpson

It looks like luring Mathieu Debuchy from Lille is a lot harder than first anticipated, and according to reports, Newcastle United are willing to turn to FC Twente right-back Roberto Rosales if things do not work out as planned. Rosales, a Venezuelan international since 2007, is twenty-three years of age and an exciting prospect at the Dutch club. Of course we have done quite well with our last signing from this side in the shape of Cheik TiotÃ© for about Â£3.5m and we are seeking more  value in Rosales, who isÂ apparently available for a fee in the region of Â£3m as well.Â Needless to say, we are going to be linked with a lot of players from now until the end of September and only few will arrive.

According to ever reliable Wikipedia(!) Rosales can play right-wing as well, although I haven't seen him play so I'm not sure whether that's correct or not. If he does indeed offer a RM value then you can see why he would appeal to Alan Pardew and co. We are looking for versatility all the time and Ryan Taylor is an example of a solid footballer that is an integral part of the squad due to hisÂ qualitiesÂ in all areas of the pitch - includingÂ set pieces.

The positive thing about us at the moment is that we're not going to be left in the lurch by other teams, if our players do happen to depart to pastures new. In January of 2011, we got caught with the Andy Carroll sale and although everything worked out alright, Pardew doesn't want to be in a similar situation any time soon!

Rosales, Debuchy, Clyne - we have options when it comes to the RB spot. If Danny won't sign a new contract then we'll move on pretty quickly.

No longer will a player hold this club toÂ ransom, and thankfully so.
