![Newcastle - What is in store in Villa Park?](http://www3.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Alan+Shearer+Takes+Over+Newcastle+United+Manager+Gkc4swu7cYBl.jpg)

The demise of Newcastle United is a sad story and very sad one indeed. Once an extremely powerful force in English Football, the Magpies have plundered to the lowest of the low, occupying an automatic relegation seat, and only one game left in the entire season to save it. I'm sick of the constant nonsense that has happened with Newcastle, the ownership, the poor performances and the instability. We've had our chances to get safe, Stoke away, Pompey at home, and recently Fulham at home. We managed to beat Middlesbrough 3-1 and we hoped for some of the same against the Cottagers, however, some poor refereeing decisions and luck prised away from any share of the spoils.

Boro themselves managed a point at home to Villa whilst the worst result for our sakes was Hull nabbing a point at Bolton. Hull have Manchester United next at the KC stadium Â whereas we have Aston Villa in Villa Park. More than likely we'll be going down but for some odd reason I think we just might pull a great escape off come Monday. We will know what our job is after Saturday but there is also the chance we might know were relegated or pretty much. Then again there is a very unrealistic outcome with Hull and ourselves staying up and Sunderland being relegated. This could happen if we both win (Hull & Toon) and the Mackems suffer defeat to Portsmouth and Chelsea.

We can't be thinking about them though and must fully concentrate on getting 3 points at Villa Park. We're hoping for a non-attacking performance from Villa and the odd mistake if possible. James Milner might be able to do us a few favors. Hull need to lose at United, even a draw wouldn't do in my opinion. If a reserve United team can manage to beat Hull then we would only need a draw against Villa to stay in the Premier League. That would keep us in top flight football on goal difference, beginning to sound like Fulham eh? Sunday is our day and indeed all eyes will be focused on Hull's game too. The history of NUFC is resting on 2 games, Hull City v Manchester United and Aston Villa v Newcastle United. Is avoiding relegation a step too far for the Magpies this time?
