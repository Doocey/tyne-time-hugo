![Dowie - Believes Newcastle can get a result](http://images.rivals.net/08/05/460x238/Iain-Dowie-face-2_873390.jpg)

Iain Dowie has come out today and talked about the important game at Stoke and the approach that the Magpies will take to it. Dowie knows the importance of the game itself and what either a win or loss could do to Newcastle United and it's Premier League survival hopes. Many pundits have fancied us to go down but Dowie believes himself and Alan can lead the Magpies to safety. It's been a big change in things with the club but I think Ashley has made a good decision in appointing Shearer and it seems that he'll allow Big Al to do it the way he wants.

Dowie said :

> “We’ve got to talk about the positives against Chelsea, like the first half.

> “The lads covered some yards. We out-ran and out-sprinted Chelsea, which you will do when you’re chasing the ball a little bit.

> “We’ve got to implement more of the same, which is high tempo.

> “We’ve got to go to Stoke and pass the ball.

> “Alan and myself both look at ourselves and see what we could have done better, and that’s important.”

Shearer has also made it clear that this fight is about the club and not about his managerial career :

> Alan’s been brought in as the leader of the club, and myself and everyone else have got to be leaders as well.”

> “Alan’s got very, very good friends, and is probably closer to them than me.

> “We’ve always been very good friends and had discussions.

>“He’s got a very good sense of humour – he’s very dry.’’

Let's hope we do play the football and get the three points.

Comments appreciated 🙂
