###Â Hughton - Confident that only additions will be made

Chris Hughton has said he's very confident that the squad will not shrink in numbers anymore, after nearly 10 players left in the summer. In return there's been Danny Simpson, Marlon Harewood, and the long-named Zurab. All Premier League players to be fair but neither have showed any of that quality with perhaps Danny Simpson as an exception. However, Hughton  believes that there will be no more out goings at the club but instead new faces will more than likely arrive at the forever St.James' Park.

Speaking today he said :

> 'I'm confident that we won't lose anybody â€“ all I'm thinking of is adding, and not taking away,'
>
> 'I appreciate that we have quite a tight squad. What you do is build up a spirit and a team ethic, and we must make sure what we add are the right numbers and right personnel.'

Indeed we do have a big lack of numbers at the club and we need additions for the rigorous campaign that lies ahead for us. Perhaps a couple of defenders and a winger might come to the club.

Mike has said he will back Chris in the transfer market but actions speak louder than words. Ashley has lied on too many occasions and I'm not getting too excited this January window. More than likely get a couple of loans, if lucky.
