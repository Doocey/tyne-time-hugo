### Coloccini - To be dropped

Well it seems that Shearer isn't afraid to change things around and it seems that Fabricio Coloccini will be first to feel the wrath of the new boss. Coloccini has been in poor form all season bar his debut against Manchester United where he looked worthy of all the £10.3m we paid for him. However he has been at fault for many of our goals including Chelsea's first on Saturday. He is simply too slow but hopefully he can improve and get used to the Premier League soon. It seems that Bassong and Steven Taylor could be the two center backs for Stoke with Enrique and Beye the fullbacks.

Shearer said today :

_“I enjoyed the day but I didn’t enjoy coming away with nothing and then walking into the dressing-room afterwards. But that is a part of the job I was well aware of,”

“It was a tough start, but I have tried to drum the positives rather than the negatives into the players. The confidence is not high. You can see that in the way we conceded the first goal and we started giving them more chances after that.”

“I have no complaints about the effort and the work-rate. They came in at half time tired but they’d enjoyed it. To snuff a team out with the ability of Chelsea, everything had worked well for us. I said at half time, the game lasts 90 minutes, not 45.”

“I have told the players not to worry about making mistakes in the right areas. I will not criticize them for trying something in the right areas.”

“I will try a bit of everything to raise their confidence. I am sure they have had everything tried, with the tellings off and the arms around the shoulder, but a different voice and different personalities might just work in a different way,”

“When we have conceded goals this season, we have tended to go on and concede more and lose games. That mentality has to change. It is a great arena to play in with 52,000 demanding fans, but it is an arena which demands success.”_

Well Stoke is a tough one, we need to win but that's said about every game this season right?

Comments appreciated 🙂
