### Mulemo - Not a lot is known about this lad but he's highly rated in Belgium

Before I start, I'd like to congratulate a certain Ian Holloway on his fantastic success in getting Blackpool promoted in his first season at Bloomfield Road. An enthralling game at Wembley today saw the Tangerines come from behind twice and then go ahead all in the first half. A wonderful Charlie Adam free-kick, a Taylor-Fletcher nod in and a quick finish from veteran Brett  Ormerod saw Holloways side reach the promised land alongside ourselves and West Brom. Dave Jones & Cardiff again come close, but not close enough to secure Premier League football this year.

Anyway, the reports are already flying and the rumour mill is chruning out some funny stories already. This week, from my short glimpses across the web, we've been linked with Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kim KÃ¤llstrÃ¶m, Albin Ebondo, Joe Ledley, Urby Emanuelson and now Landry Mulemo. Some big names in there that will never make the move to St.James' Park so lets forget it.

This Landry Mulemo guy is from Congo and has been linked with a move away from Liege ever since his contract began to expire. He's 23 and a LB predominantly. Whether he's any good I'm not sure but I can remember him playing The Emirates last year and he was no Jose Enrique anyway.

Albin Ebondo however, is too about to become a free agent and he may be a good acquisition for Newcastle. Remember, January 2009 we tried to splash Â£4m on this guy but it broke down because Toulouse wanted even more. Now that he's free and still only 26, he may be worth a shot indeed.

Chris Hughton has already said that he has no interest in the majority of players he's been linked with over the last few weeks but it's understood that he is drawing up a list of targets for the transfer window. Knowing Chris, he'll make contact, make an offer and get it sorted as quickly as possible, if he can.

That said, if anyone knows anything about Landry Mulemo, we'd like to hear about it!
