### Simpson - Only arrival this summer

Danny Simpson's arrival from Manchester United a while back has been Newcastle's only 'signing' of the summer, so far. Mind you, it's only a loan deal and lasts to January, which is pretty poor if you ask me. I can't see why Newcastle don't look to loan Macheda, or Fabio or indeed  his brother Rafael.

There are plenty of players, as I've said many times before, that would join Newcastle in a flash, now more than ever, after our good start to the Coca Cola Championship campaign. Thing is, the only transfer activity at Newcastle will be the exit door, and eight players have already fled from Tyneside.

It's a good thing that some of them players left but we need to replace them with new blood, the likes of Championship standard or the much talked aboutÂ Per Ciljan Skjelbred, who I tend to hold high regard for. He's already indicated that he'd be more than willing to join but it's very doubtful that anything will be spent at Newcastle this summer.

It's disappointing to say the least, considering we've a good chance of promotion this season. We just need 5 new faces and we could be in serious contention for automatic promotion. Indeed one of them signings would have to be Alan Shearer, but the odds of that, or any of the above, are disintegrating day by day.
