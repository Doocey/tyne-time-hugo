#### Carroll - Committed to Newcastle United and our Premier League survival bid

Well we know Stoke were interested and who could blame them. A strong, tall old fashioned centre-forward at only 20 years of age and with a newly promoted team. In fact, he would have been the perfect player for Stoke City, and the 'football' they play. With James Beattie looking like he may well leave The Britannia, Carroll would've been the ideal replacement but the  Geordie lad is committed to his home-town club. Well we know Stoke were interested and who could blame them. A strong, tall old fashioned centre-forward at only 20 years of age and with a newly promoted team. In fact, he would have been the perfect player for Stoke City. However, his concentration is on NUFC and no other club as he look set to sign a new contract.

Andy will be a very important player to our hopes of staying up this season and he will be a man to get us goals if we can manage a few! He did very well in the Coca Cola Championship last season but the Premier League a way different kettle of fish. We'll have to grit it out for points this forthcoming season and Carroll is well able above anyone else to battle his way out of trouble! ðŸ˜€

There were reports that Chelsea were also interested in his services but we're not sure whether they were accurate of not.

You may all remember Andy Carroll's goals in the season we went down, one fantastic header against West Ham at St.James' Park and they other even better against Stoke City (conveniently) which we thought would be an season saving point.

He also scored against Manchester City that season and if there were other goals, they've slipped my mind.

The important thing is -Â  Andy Carroll will be playing for Newcastle United this season and seasons after, whilst hopefully scoring a good few goals in the process.

It will be tough, and the 6'4 U-21 International will find it difficult to score goals like he did in the Championship last season. That said, we still think he'll bang in a few!
