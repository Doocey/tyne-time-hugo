### Erding - Newcastle have had a Â£5m bid for the Frenchman rejected today

We've been linked with Erding before, and today it's being reported in France Football that we've had a â‚¬6m offer for the striker rejected by PSG. It seems as if Chris Hughton is keen to sign Erding, because if all reports are accurate, this is the second bid that has been rejected for his services. I can't say I know a lot about the forward, but Arsenal were interested not very  long ago so he's obviously decent. Add that to the fact that PSG have rejected Â£5m for him.

Hughton has said he wants a couple more signings in before the close of the window, or even before their match against Manchester United on Monday, with a striker and a winger theÂ priorities, even though we need cover for the LB area.

it seems as if the hierarchy are stepping up the chase for new signings, which is good to see, because we need new arrivals if we weant to stay in the Premier League. We need a creative striker like Obafemi Martins, fast and strong, and Erding, and if memory serves me correctly, is all of the above.

Anyway, we can only wait and see if this is true, and whether we can sign Ben Arfa and Erding before the United test.
