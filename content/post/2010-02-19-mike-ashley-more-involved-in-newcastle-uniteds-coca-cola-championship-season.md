![Mike Ashley](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01349/mike_ashley_1349947c.jpg "Ashley - Seems to be working in a close relationship with Chris Hughton")

In a season that has saw our owner Mike Ashley try to sell but failing miserably yet again, however finally deciding to establish a tad of stability at the club. By that, it meant selling players, keeping some and after a long debacle as to who would be the full-time manager of Newcastle United, appointing Chris Hughton the former assistant of Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer (alongside  Iain Dowie). Hughton has since guided us to a pretty decent season so far which sees us top of the Coca Cola Championship, as we enter the final stages of what's been a long season, and it's still not over.

I'm sure that the fine run of form that Chris Hughton and the players have been on throughout the season in general has indeed helped strengthen the relationship between Hughton and Mr.Ashley. If results weren't going too well, what kind of relationship or scenario on Tyneside we'd have, I really don't know.

As much as we don't like Mike Ashley for his disastrous running of the club since his arrival, we must say that the January transfer window and the funds allocated to Chris Hughton were quite pleasing, even though we did miss out on a very promising player in the shape of Victor Moses. We managed however to get in Mike Williamson, Wayne Routledge, Patrick van Aanholt, Fitz Hall, Leon Best and Danny Simpson. As well as that, we finally offloaded Â£60,000 a week Geremi to Turkish side AnkaragÃ¼cÃ¼.

At any club, in any sport, a healthy working relationship between both the manager, players and the hierarchy of the club is essential if you want to be successful organization. Of late, Mike Ashley hasn't done too much wrong, but maybe that's because he hasn't done a whole lot at all! ðŸ˜€

Either way, long may the healthy bond continue and more importantly, let the lads focus on promoting this mighty club to the Premier League.
