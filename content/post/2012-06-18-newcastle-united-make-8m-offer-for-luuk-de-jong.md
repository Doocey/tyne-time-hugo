####Â de Jong - Â£8m bid submitted for the Dutchman to replace Ba?

In the last few minutes,SkySports have reported on a bit of Newcastle United transfer news. There are claims that Newcastle United have submitted an official bid in the region of Â£8m for FC Twente's Luuk de Jong - signalling that Demba Ba could be very close to departing St.James' Park. Either that, or NUFC are actually closing in on a deal for someone we don't know about, and the de Jong rumours are simply a smokescreen for the deal. However, I've a feeling that we really are  looking to lure the Dutchman to Tyneside and indeed our latest link with him makes it theÂ umpteenth time both the club and the forwards name have been bandied about.

Â£8m comes to about â‚¬10m and I'm assuming that this wouldn't be enough to persuade the Dutch outfit to let their star man hold talks with Alan Pardew and co. Of course as mentioned before, we wouldn't be bidding for the striker unless someone else is leaving. That person of course, is expected to be syrup-loving, #19 Demba Ba.

Mind you, only today Alan Pardew said he hoped Demba would stay at Newcastle.

It goes without saying that reports from SkySports do not always mean that a deal will happen, but I'd be fairly certain that Ba's days are numbered at SJP. [I mentioned just a few days ago that his departure was imminent](http://www.tynetime.com/2012/06/14/no-bids-received-for-ba-but-move-away-from-newcastle-united-looks-imminent/) as it seems his countless, and nameless agents would like a decent wedge in their pockets, right before Ba hits the dreaded 30 years of age mark.

More to follow on this..
