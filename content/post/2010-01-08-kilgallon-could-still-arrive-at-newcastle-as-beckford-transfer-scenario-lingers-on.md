### Kilgallon - Newcastle still reportedly in the hunt despite statement

Although Matthew Kilgallon indicated that he will stay on at Sheffield United for the remainder of the season, there are still rumours out there that he could well still arrive at St. James' Park. As he's in his last few months of his contract at Bramall Lane, Kilgallon will seek a move in the summer for free, and to a Premier League club if he can. However, Chris Hughton is still  interested in the former Leeds defender and it's not outside the realms of possibility that Kilgallon could pull on a Black and White jersey in the month of January.

On the other hand, our supposed failure to grasp Kilgallon has meant that according to the Evening Chronicle, Leon Cort will be sought after for defensive cover behind Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor. Whether it's true or not, I really don't know.

Speaking to Goal.com yesterday, Jermaine Beckford apparently said he was 'off to Newcastle'. Yet again however, there's been little talk in the media of the Beckford scenario since then. We expect that Hughton is working hard to secure a deal for the 20 goal striker.

Hughton is adamant his transfer targets will arrive but he might not necessarily mean Beckford or Kilgallon, I heard Ezequiel Lavezzi was being linked. How realistic ðŸ˜€

Either way, time will tell. We'll just have to see if Mike Ashley will loosen his purse strings this January or if it will be another disappointing start to the year.
