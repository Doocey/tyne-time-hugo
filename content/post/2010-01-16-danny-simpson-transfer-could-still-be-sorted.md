### Simpson - The deal is not totally dead according to reports

Newcastle fans are describing the transfer of Danny Simpson as one of the most important steps Chris Hughton will take this season. The Manchester United RB has been on-loan since last year and has impressed the Geordie fans with his performances and especially, his attitude. However, the move has stalled because of Danny's wage demands. As I wrote yesterday, NUFC supposedly  have a wage-cap for the Coca Cola Championship campaign in place, and Simpson's desired wage packet stretches beyond the limit.

The Journal reported that the deal was dead yesterday but have another article [today](http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-simpson-deal-not-dead-4466052 "today") claiming that the transfer could well take place yet. As I said, if Simpson is looking for too high of wages then there's not much the club can do but decline.

However, the question really is, what is his wage demands? We're not sure what he is on at Manchester United but I'm sure it's not a bad pay-packet at all. As well as this, a lot of United fans were calling for Danny to be recalled to solve their full-back problem which was effected badly by injuries.

> _“Danny is in the right frame of mind to play on Monday night, even though it might be his last game for us.“As part of the agreement, his last game is on Monday, but Danny is a very good professional week in, week out and I would not anticipate any problems with his frame of mind._

He added :
> _“**Negotiations are taking place**, and they are always very private. Sometimes it does not end up that way, but the starting position has to be it is private between the player and the negotiator.“Danny has done very well for us and we are hopeful something will happen. It is probably getting a little bit boring I suppose.'_

Chris does seem optimistic that the Englishman could still arrive however, senior sources at the club (who?!) are reported as far from optimistic. Some Toon fans are calling for his wages demands to be matched because it'll mean Premier League promotion will increase wage-demands all around the club either way.

I really don't know what the scenario is at St.James' Park but we do know that Danny Simpson will play against West Brom, in what is probably the most important game of the Coca Cola Championship campaign.

If we get a win at home to the Baggies and indeed win our following game after that, then you can't help but get just a tad excited about the prospect of winning the Championship outright. However, we've seen throughout the years that you'll usually end up disappointed if you get excited about Newcastle's chances in any competition.

Our hope at the minute really is that Danny Simpson becomes a permanent Newcastle United player, and as quickly as possible. Maybe we'll get a surprise and he + a few others will sign soon. Dreams eh? 😐

Comments welcome 🙂
