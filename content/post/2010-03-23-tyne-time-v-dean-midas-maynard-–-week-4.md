Sorry for the late post up and indeed for the missing article last week but I've been incredibly busy with other activities. Last week, Dean predicted a 1-2 win to Newcastle United against Bristol and I predicted a 0-2 win for us. Neither of us were right but the previous week, we both predicted the exact scoreline with a 3-0 guess in the Newcastle United v Scunthorpe game. This week, as I  speak, Newcastle United are playing Doncaster at the Keepmoat stadium and our predictions are as follows:

**Tyne Time** : Doncaster 1-2 Newcastle United

**Dean Maynard** - Doncaster 1-1 Newcastle United.

Dena has said he expects a very very tight game and I think every other Toon supporter in the land will know that we're not having a enjoyable time at the Keepmoat Stadium.

The table stands like this :

Tyne Time - **15pts**

Dean Midas Maynard - **15pts**

I'll keep you updated and just as I type this, Andy Carroll has put us ahead, ironic!

Updates to follow..
