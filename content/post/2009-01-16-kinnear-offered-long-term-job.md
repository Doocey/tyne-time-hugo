## Joe Kinnear - Stability finally here as job is offered to Kinnear?

Maybe it's odd news to hear during the transfer window but at least it isn't any of the usual 'N'Zogbia wants out' or 'Sell before we buy' on the papers tomorrow. Oh no, its the story that Joe Kinnear has been offered the Newcastle job on aÂ **full time basis**. This is good news to hear as it seems we might actually be in for stability at the club regarding managers. We've gone through so many managers in the last years and some of them very talented to say the least.

Even if you're not a Kinnear fan, you have to say that he's made a lot of improvements at the club and indeed in the team. He has the Newcastle players fighting for the club and for the badge on their shirt and to be honest I haven't saw that in a Toon team for a long long time. It would also mean some stability for the club and for the fans, to know who their boss will be for the next few years. It would end the managerial rumours going around and means we could get down to business on the field, firstly though we must survive relegation. When we see other relegation contenders Manchester City coming close to signing KakÃ¡ for an unbelievable fee it may make you wonder, just a little ðŸ˜€

This alone may show Ashley's intent for Newcastle and finally some stability which is the key to anything, if Ashley really means this and wants a stable future for NUFC I'm all for it ðŸ˜€
