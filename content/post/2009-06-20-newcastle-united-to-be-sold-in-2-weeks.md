###Â NUFC - Progress is being made with buyers

Apparently Newcastle could be sold in about two weeks, according to a source within the club. This is encouraging news and the news that follows would be even better. They expect  a managerial announcement (Shearer) by the 28th which would give Shearer time to train the lads, and get rid of some surplus player as well as bring some new ones in.

It's understood that all the buyers want Shearer as manager but of cours there can only be one owner unless they all pitched in and made Newcastle United one of the richest clubs in the world. We need this club sorted soon but then again we've been saying this since Joe Kinnear took charge (who?!) and although there has been some progress made, we're still in the Coca Cola Championship, and in a deep black hole. Hopefully the buyers will gain 100% of Newcastle by 2 weeks and Shearer will have been appointed before that. Too much to ask?
