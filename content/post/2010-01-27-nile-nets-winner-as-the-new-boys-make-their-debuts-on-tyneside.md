### Ranger - Netted again tonight as we saw Routledge & Williamson in action

Tonights affair was a game we needed all three points from and the lads duly delivered the goods. In what was a Crystal Palace team without one of their main men in Victor Moses saw them concede within twenty minutes, a Shaun Derry O.G. In fairness, it seems as if Palace gave it a real go and could well have got something out of the game on another day. Newcastle United  former, Darren Ambrose looked their most promising throughout, testing Steve Harper on several occasions within the 90 minutes.

A Palace side that saw only 3 subs were being split apart by Jonas and Enrique in the opening stages if reports are accurate and we too could've scored a few more goals. However, the 3 points aside, it was interesting to see the new players in action.

Mike Williamson started at CB and had a decent game or so they say, whilst new winger Wayne Routledge came off the bench to assist Nile Ranger for his first goal at St.James' Park, and hopefully the first of many in a Black & White Shirt for both.

That said, although I haven't saw any footage and couldn't get hold of an audio link, the general opinion is that we got the win and just about. As I said, on another day, Palace could've scored a few goals against us and put us into real trouble.

6 points against Neil Warnock's side is always good to see but if you're a Crystal Palace fan and one I know in particular springs to mind, then you'll be anxiously awaiting the aftermath of the administration. We don't like to see any club go into administration to be fair, it's the start of a long and daunting road.

Anyway, 3 points in the bag, 3 players signed and 3 points ahead at the top of the table with a game to spare. We're not doing too badly at all.
