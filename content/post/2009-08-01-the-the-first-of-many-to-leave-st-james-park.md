###Â Martins - Should succeed in Germany

The first of many departures at Newcastle has begun with Obafemi Martins's transfer to Wolfsburg. The Bundesliga champions paid Newcastle â‚¬10.5m for the Nigerian and that's not a bad fee to receive. The only  thing is, we wonder where the money will go. Into Mike Ashley pocket or back into the club in order to buy new players. We still don't know if there are new owners on the horizon but we certainly hope so as this day week, we play West Brom in the opening game of the Coca Cola Championship.

We expect Fabricio Coloccini, Jonas Gutierrez, Xisco, Sebastien Bassong, Habib Beye and maybe even Jose Enrique to follow Martins out of the door. However, with reports rife that a takeover will be announced in the next three days we still don't know what's to believe or what can be ignored. We mourned the passing of the great Sir Bobby Robson and if we have owners before the West Brom game the attitude around Newcastle and indeed in The Hawthorns would be one of excitement and relief. Just imagine it, A Newcastle United team with Shearer as manager and new owners, no more Mike Ashley or Derek Llambias. Maybe it's too much to ask?
