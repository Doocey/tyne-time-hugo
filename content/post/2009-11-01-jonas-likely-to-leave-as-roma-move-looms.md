###Â Jonas - Reportedly on Roma's radar

Just as it seems all is settled on Tyneside regards players, reports have emerged of Jonas Gutierrez possibly moving away from Newcastle in January. The news comes from no-one else but his agent, and how annoying them agents happen to become. As a Newcastle United fan down through the years, agents of players have often proved to be a thorn in our side as they like to force moves and indeed make themselves a little money in the process. Charles N'Zogbia's  move to Wigan Athletic springs to mind, and now another winger in Jonas is being linked with a move away from the temporary St.James' Park.

Gutierrez is quite a decent player but hasn't showed any real conviction in front of goal or indeed, a finishing product. It's quite a pity really considering he is quite fast, strong and seems to lose the ball very rarely. Mind you, he's a regular for Argentina.

His agent said :

> We know European clubs are interested.
>
> 'We have held meetings with Newcastle but there is an option for the player to leave - although it must be a good offer.'

Roma seem interested in Jonas, who was subject to a controversial move to Newcastle United from Mallorca when Kevin Keegan was in charge. It's believed Jonas Gutierrez was another Dennis Wise signing but that's another matter, for another day.

It would be interesting to see what kind of price would be offered for the Argentinian international. If we do happen to receive an offer in the region of Â£6-7m then surely we'll have to consider it, seriously.
