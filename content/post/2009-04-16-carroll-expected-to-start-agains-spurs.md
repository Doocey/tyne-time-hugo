![Carroll - Ready for Tottenham game on Sunday](http://images.teamtalk.com/09/03/330/Carroll_1992660.jpg)

After a great header on Saturday last against Stoke, Big Andy is ready to start against Tottenham and hopefully score a couple of goals. We need all three points but then again, that's been the story of our season so far. We have finally reached the 30 point mark but Boro are level with us. They have a home game against Fulham and you'd nearly fancy Middlesbrough for that one despite Fulham's good away form. Fulham beat Man City at Eastlands on Sunday and you have to salute them on that, a very good win indeed. Fulham themselves were in a similar situation to us, and secured safety on the last day, tagged as a miracle. I certainly hope it won't come down to the last day for us and that we'll be safe before the last day.

Shearer said today :

> “Andy has been doing that sort of thing since I got here,”
>
> “We had him in sessions all week, and he did it all week. To be fair to Shola, he worked very hard without much success in front of goal.”
>
> “It was the right time to make a change, because Shola hasn’t played much. Neither has Andy, and it would have been good to start with him.”
>
> “They’ve given me problems, and that’s what I want. I want as many selection problems as possible.” “We’ve still got injuries, but we can handle it.”

Ameobi is expected to miss out with even Viduka returning. Maybe the return of Keegan's 433 with Viduka, Martins and Owen all upfront? I don't expect so, but it did work brilliantly, especially against Spurs at White Hart Lane 😉 What ever team Shearer plays we hope it can get all 3 points and get the cleanup underway.

Comments appreciated 🙂
