### Taylor - Expect a rampant performance from him vs Villa

When Newcastle have come down to the last day of the Premier League witht the hope they can better another teams performance for safety, it really makes you wonder. If Hull and Sunderland win on the last day of the Premier League it doesn't matter if we win or how much we score. We will be relegated if Sunderland beat Chelsea and Hull overcome an U-18 Manchester United team. Who would've thought  when Newcastle drew 1-1 at Old Trafford at the start of the season, that they'd be deciding their footballing fate on the final day of the Premier League campaign? Alan Shearer has rallied his players today, claiming that the players can become heroes on Monday at 9 am.

Shearer said :

> “He’s been huge for us in the games that I’ve been here, so he’ll be a big loss, but someone else could come in and make a name for themselves, or be a hero.
>
> “It’s an opportunity for other players as well.
>
> “We’ll have a look at things.
>
> “We’ll give it a go – we’re not out of it yet.”
>
> “We threw everything at them and created a lot of chances. We played with three at the back, gambled and left ourselves open.
>
> “But in the second half I still believed we could get something.”

It also seems that Shearer is quietly confident that Newcastle can stay up.

> “We are up against it. But I’m sure there are still some twists and turns to come yet.”

Indeed we are up against it but which of Hull, Sunderland aren't?

Wouldn't it be sweet to send Sunderland down with us staying up? I don't mind what way Newcastle stay in the Premier League, as long as they do.

Comments appreciated 🙂
