![Taylor - About to leave his boyhood club?](http://www1.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Newcastle+United+v+Fulham+Premier+League+j5YMyy_9LlBl.jpg)

It's sad when it has come to this, a Newcastle United player, brought through the ranks, and having becoming a Newcastle United first team member, looking for the exit door at St.James' Park. Sky Sports News  (who else?) are reporting that the local lad, could be set for a move to David Moyes's Everton side who are fighting a losing battle with their own English centre back, Joleon Lescott. If this news is true, which we hope it's not, then it'll really put gas to the fire and the frustration will be taken out on Mike Ashley more than ever before. It's sad to see the likes of Bassong and Beye leave, and indeed Damien Duff, but to see a lad who's dream it was to play for NUFC, on his way out, really shows you how much we have fallen.

There are no indications from Everton's behalf just yet but it was revealed that an Everton official was present at yesterdays game between Newcastle and Sheffield Wednesday. Indeed he wouldn't have been disappointed as Taylor was named MOTM with another solid performance. We certainly hope this is just speculation and that Sky Sports are wrong on this one but it isn't looking too good for the fans. You'd have to ask yourself whether Taylor would swap Tyneside for Merseyside, that we don't know, but should he reject the opportunity to play for the Toffees then what a hero he'd be then! Apparently it all hinges on Barry Moat's takeover and Alan Shearer becoming manager.
