## Zan - Offered to Newcastle

Turkish international GÃ¶khan Zan has been offered to Newcastle United according to reports in Turkey. Zan who is an international for Turkey and quite highly regarded in his homeland has been rumoured to have been on his way to Everton last summer but is seems that he has been offered to the Toon, and another Premier League club, so that a permanent deal can be done in the. Besiktas who were heavily linked with Geremi may look for a swap deal in the summer but it all depends on how this lads fares out, should the loan deal go through.

Standing at 6'4 he is quite a tall center back and indeed a threat from set pieces and could come in very handy in the latter stages of this season. He is 27 years old and he isn't the oldest to say the least. It is worth noting that GÃ¶khan Zan played v Germany in the Euro 2008 semi-final where Turkey crashed out agonizingly. A Turkish international, 6'4, 27 years old and offered to Newcastle on loan, with all our injuries I'd be very happy to take him ðŸ™‚ I think most other Newcastle fans would agree

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
