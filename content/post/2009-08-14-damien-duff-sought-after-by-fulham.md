###Â Duff - Hodgson interested

I suppose you could say things go from bad to worse for Newcastle, first sources close to the club indicating that they are ready to take Newcastle United from the market and now, one of our half decent players ready to move down London way to opt for Fulham. You can't blame Damien for wanting to leave and especially to a prospering side such as Fulham. Roy Hodgson who rescued Fulham on the last day from relegation a few seasons back has turned Fulham into a feared side and they have a very bright future. Roy knows Damien and thinks he'd be tempted for a move down to the capital.

Roy said :

> 'The clubs are talking and I hope the deal will go through. He's a player that interests us,'
>
> 'Damien and I go back a long way from when we worked together at Blackburn. He wants to come back to west London.
>
> 'Damien had injury problems at Chelsea and has done well at Newcastle given the turmoil there.
>
> 'Every time he's played for Ireland he's consistently been one of their best performers.
>
> 'We know what we'd be getting with Damien - he's an experienced and quality player.'

If Duff is to leave which we expect him to do so, we need replacements and very fast. If Ashley's staying then we need new faces in and as soon as tomorrow, we've got Simpson on loan but we need more than loan signings, some permanent. And most importantly, Shearer as manager to coach them.
