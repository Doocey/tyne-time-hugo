![NUFC - Moat waiting on Keegan scenario](http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/03_03/NewcastleGroundPA_468x312.jpg)

The news hasn't bee based on the takeover news this Sunday or indeed the last week, which is quite surprising. Barry Moat is still on course to complete the takeover of our beloved club but he;s waiting on the Kevin Keegan court case to be settled before he's handed the keys of St.James' Park. You can imagine the scenes around Newcastle when Mike Ashley finally leaves the  club, and a local owner with every ambition to appoint Alan Shearer as manager, control the club properly, or so we hope.

We're currently top of the league now with quite winnable fixtures forthcoming, although QPR will be quiet tough, on the back of a win at the weekend. However, with Kevin Nolan in the form he is, who knows what'll happen.

Shola Ameobi and Jonas are due to return in the near future but Fabricio Coloccini is reportedly out of the QPR tie. Ryan Taylor's injury is still unknown as well, but we certainly hope it's nothing serious.

If we can keep this form till Christmas, then we'd hope Barry Moat would scuffer up some money for Shearer (if it's him) to spend on new targets, and ones of Alan's choice. Then who knows, a return to the Premier League, and a memorable one at that, might be on the cards.
