### Hull - Have Villa next at Villa Park

Newcastle players are no doubt fully aware of their task on Monday when Portsmouth come to St.James'. After the weekends results which included Hull getting beaten 3-1 by Liverpool, West Brom pulling off a major shock hammering Sunderland 3-0 and Middlesbrough looked destined for defeat at the Emirates. 3 points no excuses is what tomorrow demands as we may well be able to escape this relegation battle. We may as well know that after Pompey we have Liverpool away which you wouldn't expect to yield any points. Then it's Boro in another must win game and then Fulham who we can beat if we play properly.

Lady Luck has shined on us the weekend and we hope that she'll keep shining to the end of the season, one thing is for sure, we haven't got any luck this season whatsoever. I've a feeling Shearer has something big in store for Monday, as the clubs background committee are set to hand out boxes of memorabilia to try urge the lads even more. To be perfectly honest, if we don't win tomorrow our season is over and we're going down. We hope and pray that we collect the 9 points at home and maybe even another surprise point at Villa/Liverpool. Tomorrow is the time we change things, tomorrow is the day we get this operation into action and tomorrow is the day we have to get all 3 points.
