I'm sure you all have players that you'd love to see play at Newcastle and now since Mike Ashley is staying and will supposedly 'back Chris in the market' then we might expect some new players to arrive, or certainly hope so. One of the players that Chris has to decide on in the very near future is Marlon Harewood. The bulky striker has been on loan from Villa since September  and has failed to produce anything special so far. Saying that, he hasn't had a proper run at things and booing from the home fans made his job even harder. However, he recent performance/effort v Peterborough saw him earn a warm reception amongst the Geordie faithful.

If I'm to name one player I would love to see strut his stuff for Newcastle, then it would be Per Ciljan Skjelbred. The Rosenborg midfielder is a Toon fan at heart and has reportedly been interested in a move to Newcastle for a few years now.

These are the type of players that we need at the club now, especially in the Championship. Fancy, tricky lightweight wingers are all good and well but in the CCC, things are rough, and for a reason. We need strong physical players which can put up with the challenge, the likes of Steven Taylor, Kevin Nolan and maybe even Joey Barton spring to mind.

All in all, we need some skill on either wing and we might have it with Jonas Gutierrez. He's a good runner and now that he's scored his first goal for the club it could mean more to follow, and we certainly hope so.

With a mixture of creativity and run of your mills players, Newcastle stand a very good chance of being promoted based on their current form. Needless to say, there's a long trek in front of us.

Anyway, what players would you like to see Chris sign now that there's supposedly 'cash' available.

An no Lionel Messi's please ðŸ˜€
