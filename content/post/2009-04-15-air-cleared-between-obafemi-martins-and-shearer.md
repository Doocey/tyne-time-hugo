### Martins - Important to Newcastle's survival

Newcastle's assistant manager Iain Dowie insists that Oba Martins is a very important figure to Newcastle United and our survival hopes this season. Martins suspiciously pulled out of the game at Stoke at 11am complaining of a groin strain and Shearer didn't seemed best pleased at that considering he had worked on a system all week in preparation for the visit to the Britannia. Rumours had mounted that there had been a rift between both the management and the little Nigerian but Iain Dowie has confirmed that there was no argument. We all want to see Martins scoring for the Magpies again.

Dowie said :

> 'There hasn't been a falling out with Martins and the matter has been dealt with,' Dowie told the club's website.
>
> 'It's gone and it's in the past and he has said he is fully behind the cause here.
>
> 'We never said there wasn't an injury .
>
> 'All Alan expressed was his disappointment was that he had not been told about the injury until 1115 on the Saturday morning, which was too late.
>
> 'It was disappointing that's all because we had been working on a system all week and then had to scrap it at the last minute because of the injury to Oba.'

Dowie insisted that the incident it water under the bridge and that there is only one thing on both the management's mind and Martins, avoiding relegation.

> 'There is no bad feeling,' he said.
>
> 'He has gone away for a scan and hopefully the prognosis will be a good one and he will be back involved quickly because he is an important player for us.
>
> 'The communication should have been better but to be fair to Oba he was desperate to be involved and maybe that was why he kept quiet about the injury.'

Let's hope he doesn't have an injury and that he's back for the Spurs game, a game which we hopefully can win on Sunday afternoon.
