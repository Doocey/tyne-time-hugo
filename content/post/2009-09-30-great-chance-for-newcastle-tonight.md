![Jonas - Back for QPR test](http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Newcastle+United+v+Sheffield+Wednesday+Vx4-b96pvkom.jpg)

Jonas Gutierrez is back for tonight's encounter with QPR at St.James' Park following his absence due to injury. The Argentine, who has pledged his allegiance to Newcastle and to his country to bring both of them to where they belong, Argentina to the World Cup and the more important one, Newcastle United back to the Premier League. It will good to welcome back  Jonas who will be more than an asset in the Coca Cola Championship, and just as he was getting into his stride, injury struck vs Huddersfield, in the same game as Shola Ameobi limped off.

As my headline suggests, there is an absolutely huge chance for Newcastle United tonight. Yesterdays game saw West Brom lose to then, bottom of the table Barnsley and also, Middlesbrough losing as well. The chance for Newcastle to go 5-points ahead at the top of table is something that doesn't come along too often.

Providing we win tonight, we'll play Bristol at Home in the following week. Another winnable game and who knows, maybe West Brom, 'Boro and Sheffield will all mess up again, and we certainly hope so.

The scene is set tonight, a brimming St.James' Park with 35,000 roaring Geordies and by no means Barcelona style opposition, finances aside.

This a big chance and hope the lads don't mess it up. An early goal, one before half time and another in the second half could wrap us up the three points that could prove dearly come May.

**Tyne Time's prediction**: Newcastle United 3-1 QPR
