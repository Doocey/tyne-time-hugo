### Martins - Being forced out of Newcastle even though he wants to stay

There are reports that Keith Harris, the guy  in charge of selling Newcastle, has told Mike Ashley to accept bids for Fabricio Coloccini and Obafemi Martins to ease the financial strain on himself as the sale of NUFC nears a close. Obafemi Martins who has already said he wants to stay and doesn't want to be sold is being forced out and the Journal have confirmed that bids from foreign clubs have been made for both players. Coloccini is expected to return to Spain while Martins may end up back in Italy. Inter Milan were reportedly interested in bringing Martins back but how true that is, we don't know.

I personally would love to see Martins a Newcastle player next season but I suppose if it does mean new ownership more quickly then a I suppose there's only one option. Martins would do very well in the Championship especially with Andy Carroll or a potential Jermaine Beckford upfront. As for Coloccini well he didn't have a good debut in English football and will be shipped out , sooner than later. Costing nearly Â£11m we'd be lucky to recoup Â£8m of that but that could but 3 decent Coca Cola Championship players. Kyle Naughton, Joe Mattock, Dexter Blackstock and Shane Long springs to mind. We'll just have to wait and see what happens with the takeover or if there's a takeover at all.
