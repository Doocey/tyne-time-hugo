It seems we might have found a winger for the rest of the season in Fabrice Pancrate. The Frenchman on trial at Newcastle for the last few days played in the reserves game at home to Hartlepool last night and showed some nice touches, perhaps even worthy of a permanent contract on Tyneside. The game's real hero was Phil Airey, the local lad scoring two goals in a 3-2  victory for Newcastle. However, Fabrice Pancrate and Peter Lovenkrands were in the spotlight for the 80 minutes they played more than anyone else.

Speaking about Pancrate's performance, Hughton said :

> 'He can player in a couple of positions and showed tonight that he's got a good work rate and had a few nice touches.'

Indeed Pancrate did a have a few nice touches, including an assist for one of our three goals.

It's more than likely that Chris will sign the 29 year old up on a contract till the summer at least and they'll take things from there, then.

If the lad is willing to fight for the club and work his socks off then he's more than welcome on Tyneside. All we want to see is players putting the effort in and the goals will come in time.

What do you make of the Frenchman?
