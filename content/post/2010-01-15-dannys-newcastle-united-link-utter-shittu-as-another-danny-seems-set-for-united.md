![Danny Simpson set for Manchester United after loan deal with Newcastle expires](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2009/8/14/1250247780231/Danny-Simpson-001.jpg "Simpson - "Excessive" wage demands mean he won't be a Magpie")

Do excuse the title. It was rather irresistible although probably just a little terrible all the same. Anyway, if the rumours are accurate and the many of them, Danny Simpson will return to Manchester United in the next few days. This comes as his contract talks with Chris Hughton & co. have resulted in the full-back demanding too much per-week, as listed in the 'Newcastle United  Coca Championship rule book'. As well as this it seems as if Matthew Kilgallon will wait until the summer to leave Sheffield United and Everton is his most likely destination now.

Regards our link to Danny Shittu, Chris Hughton this morning ruled out the possibility of signing the Shittu, rather **below-par defender**. Hughton also outlined his bemusement to hear of Newcastle being linked with a January swoop for the Nigerian international.

Speaking to the Journal today, he said :

> _‚ÄúThere is no truth in the reports we are looking to sign Danny Shittu.‚ÄúHe is not one we are interested in, but we are continuing to work on things in private._
>
> _‚ÄúWhen there is something to report we will let people know, but there is nothing people need to know about right now.‚Äù_

Basically he's saying there's a bit going on, on the transfer side of things but has no new signings to announce as of yet. Whether Jermaine Beckford will end up in a Toon shirt still remains to be seen, or whether indeed Danny Simpson can come to some compromise and join Newcastle United, the place he says he wants. If he really wants to be at Newcastle, he'll take a lower wage and sign for a club with hopefully, higher ambitions.

As well as this, you may have noticed in one of my previous articles, I recommended my regular reader (Chris Hughton) to look towards signing free-agent Giles Barnes. It seems however as if my _other_ regular viewer (Roberto di Matteo) took notice and has started negotiations with the former Derby County winger. I really think he's worth a shot and we've nothing to lose. It he doesn't perform and stays injury free, then offload him to lower club, if he works out then we'll be thanking our luck in signing him.

The transfer news will surely begin to increase in volume and credibility we hope. What this January transfer window has to hold for Newcastle (if anything), only time will tell.
