## Mido - Ready for move to Toon?


Ahmed Hossam Hussein Abdelhamid or more commonly known as Mido is reportedly set for a move to Newcastle United. Reports were coming from a major tabloid paper yesterday of this move which sees Alan Smith who is close to full fitness, go the other way. Most Newcastle fans it seems are well an truly delighted to see the back of Alan Smith but not me, I think he has a lot left in his tank yet and never really played as striker which is his natural position. He suffered an injury too which has kept him out until now and soon as he has regained his fitness, clubs are monitoring his situation.

It is no secret that Middlesbrough have been long admirers of Smith, only for us to beat them and 5 other clubs to Smith 18 months ago ðŸ˜› Â Mido it must be said was a talent and still is however his attitude problems have been a major stumbling block for both himself and his managers. Apparently he's faking injury so he doesn't have to play but when a big four side come along he's all ready for action. I for one, don't want a player like that, but his ability isn't questioned. It is certain Mido would look for less than the Â£60k a week Smith is on and maybe that is why we have gone in for him. Ashley has always been a fan of saving on wages (even though he goes and blows Â£5m on a casino?!) and see's Mido as the perfect man to do so.

Apparently Mido has already informed relatives and family that he is joining Newcastle and that the only reason Mido isn't pictured holding the Toon shirt just yet is because Southgate has yet to talk to Smith. It would make sense for both to go opposite ways, Smith being pushed out of the club behind his back and indeed Mido suffering the same treatment. Â Mido is 6'2 which is a very nice height, a little bit bigger than Smith anyways ðŸ˜€

Two questions remain though

1. Why would Mido leave to Newcastle after the poor treatment he got from some of the Toon fans in the derby a few weeks back?

2. Whether Smith will agree to move Boro, or indeed pass a medical, remember this could be a load of BS but the rumour is widespread and it's all hotting up!

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
