The tabloids are at it again today as another article hits Newcastle. It's not about Mike Ashley or any of the board but instead of new players that 'we'll be signing' or something to that effect. This time it isn't Pancake Pancrate, but well known Spanish hitman, Raul Tamudo. The Espanyol striker is as young as could be at 32 and in fairness to the man, has scored a fair few goals. It's being  reported that he's interested in leaving and is looking to 'rip up his contract at Espanyol'. Not very enticing signs of someone that Chris could well be looking at.

However, it's not only Newcastle that's eyeing him up, Wigan Athletic and Spurs are also rumoured to be interested. It's be reported now that Wigan are out of the running though so whether the Toon are actually interested in another thing.

Surely you'd think he'd head for White Hart Lane as they're a Premier League club but the talk is that he is quite impressed by the size of Newcastle United and it's stadium.

Either way, a 32 striker who's threatening to rip up his contract at his current squad doesn't sound too appealing but then again what about Antoine Sibierski who arrived on the last day of the transfer window? He proved to be quite a decent lad.
