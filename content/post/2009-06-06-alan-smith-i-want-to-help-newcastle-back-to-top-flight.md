###Â Smith - Wants to bring Newcastle back to Premier League

Alan Smith admits he feels guilty that Newcastle United were relegated from the Premier League and feels as if he was one of the causes. Smith arrived from Man United for Â£6m, another Allardyce signing but has never had a permanent spot in Newcastle's first 11. Smith says he will  stay at Newcastle and hopefully bring them back up to where they deserve to be, the Barclays Premier League. There may be a little problem though, Smith is one of the high earners at Newcastle pocketing Â£60,000 a week, and indeed Shearer will be looking to ship out most high earners this summer providing he is the manager.

Smith would be a very good Championship player and maybe even refind his scoring touch, who knows. Duff, Steven Taylor, Habib Beye and now Alan Smith say they all want to play for Newcastle this forthcoming season but a lot of them are earning high wages each week. Wages need to be slashed big time as Mike Ashley is still looking for a buyer. Realistically we'd expect Steve Harper, Steven Taylor, Ryan Taylor, Habib Beye, Damien Duff, Danny Guthrie, Shola Ameobi, Nicky Butt, Kevin Nolan and maybe, just maybe Jose Enrique to stay on Tyneside this summer. Of course Alan Smith might join this list too but I think some clubs will be looking for him come transfer scramble time. Whatever players go out in the Black and White of Newcastle, they'll have the support of the might Geordies.
