## Given - Committed to the Magpies

Joe Kinnear has once again reiterated his stance on Shay Given's future, Given who is one of the best keepers in the league (if not the best :)) Kinnear has no plans to sell Given and a possible move to Manchester City has been mooted as Hughes has turned to Cudicini. Why he doesn't want to start Joe Hart is beyond me though 😐 as for Given, a true professional and a great great player to say the least. Spending 11 years at Newcastle he has kept us in games or at least in a decent scoreline in so many games too. Losing Given would be like losing Alan Shearer (which we never did 😀 ) Given is an integral part of the team and would be sorely missed.

Steve Harper can obviously step in and is a very good keeper too, if elsewhere he would start week in week out. Tim Krul is also another great prospect waiting in the wings and we hope he'l stay at the Toon for a long time, certainly after his performance against Palermo, who'l ever forget that 😀

Comments appreciated
