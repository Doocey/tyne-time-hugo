### Away strip - Not going to sell that well

A mere three people  queued outside Newcastle United's official store in order to get their new banana away kit. The new release from Newcastle has been met with plenty of jokes from the papers but you can't blame them really. The only thing it signifies for me, is, it's the same colour shirt Newcastle wore when promoted from Division 2 many years ago. Either that or someone's really having a laugh, does Derek Llambias have anything to do with this? I hoped they'd change the kit to a normal colour like navy or something but no, they're going full steam ahead with their submarine shirt.

The people that did queue gave their opinions but still didn't put them off buying it.

Stephen Watson, 18, of Gateshead, was first at Newcastle's St James's Park club shop, he said :

> 'I don't even like the shirt, but I'm a Newcastle fan so I'm still happy to buy it. But I might wear a jumper on top of it.
>
> 'I didn't expect it to be this quiet. I thought I would get here early in case there was a big queue â€“ I obviously needn't have worried.'

A patient mother and her son queued for the new away kit but 10 year old son, Jack had a different opinion on the new release, he said :

> 'It's my favourite away shirt ever â€“ I'm going to wear it all the time.'

I don't know if he's being sarcastic there or what but fair play to the people that did buy the shirt, nice to see that you'll support Newcastle even in the roughest of times.
