![Beckford - Wants to join Newcastle](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01410/jermaine_beckford_1410027c.jpg)

It's a pleasant surprise to see  players wanting to join out club at this time, even though we're in the worst possible scenario, no owner, no manager and players that want to leave. On the other hand there's on man that wants to come and that's Jermaine Beckford from Leeds United. Jermaine is quite a decent striker and stands at over 6ft.  Leeds have transfer listed him and he wants to leave. It's understood other bids have been made for him but he's rejected other club, in the hope he'll join Newcastle United. Firstly though we need new owners and it seems that Jermaine is willing to wait until they have arrived.

His agent said :

> “It wouldn’t be true to say that Newcastle have missed out on Jermaine because of what is going on there.
>
> There has been interest from other clubs and I would anticipate something happening soon – maybe in the next couple of weeks when the transfer market begins to start hotting up.
>
> The longer it goes on the less chance they have of getting Jermaine, but it’s not for me to say what is going on at Newcastle. But it is certainly true that Newcastle are still a seriously attractive option for Jermaine.
>
> They are a big club, with a fantastic tradition and history and any player would love to play at St James’s Park. I’m sure he would talk to whoever takes over at Newcastle when it is sorted out.”

The saga continues though with owners taking their time over purchasing.

Comments welcome 🙂
