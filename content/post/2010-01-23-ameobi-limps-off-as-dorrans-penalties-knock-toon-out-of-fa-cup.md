### Dorrans - Lethal from the penalty spot today as Brom progress to the next round

I think it's fair to say that it wasn't our best performance all season today at the Hawthorns, and when Jonas Olsson was again the first scorer you knew it wasn't going to be our day. I can't say I saw the match but updates on nufc.co.uk got me through the feisty affair. Pre-match I wasn't too concerned if were going to be knocked out or not but of course I wouldn't have minded a  victory away to one our promotion rivals. It didn't come, with a mix of penalties, dodgy refereeing decisions and some really good individual play, it was Roberto di Matteo's side who marched on.

The more important side of things came in our last encounter against West Brom & indeed in the closing stages of today's game. Steve Taylor & Shola Ameobi both suffering what could be bad injures.

It's understood that Steven Taylor has torn ligaments in his knees, whether substantial or not I don't know but when ligaments come into the equation, it's never a good thing.

As well as this, if you've been watching Newcastle United's Coca Cola Championship campaign so far, you'll notice that Steven Taylor has played a huge part in us being where we are, top of the table.

The other news is of Shola Ameobi. According to reports he was bundled over by two West Brom players before falling badly onto his shoulder, and no penalty was given. The resulting clearance saw Brom rush upfield and win a penalty of their own, one which killed off the game.

Ameobi went off before the final whistle clutching his shoulder and we hop he hasn't injured himself badly. As well as Taylor, Ameobi has been on form in the Championship, contributing a big chunk of our goals so far.

We had hoped the injury prone Newcastle United was long gone but this is what the FA Cup can do, cause unnecessary injures, ones which could make or break one's season.

The full extent of both injuries are yet to be released.
