### Barton - Can add to our relegation battle

It's only a matter of time before Joey Barton is wearing the Newcastle United jersey again and for me, the sooner the better. He might be a thug and there is no soft explanation for what he has done in the past but he can add big time to saving NUFC from relegation this season. Costing Â£5.8m from Man City and has played roughly around 31 times with two goals to his name, both penalties, one on the last minute v Fulham and his last one against West Brom in a 3-1 win. Joey is lucky that he's not behind bars right now and has got off easily with the law. He has always said he wants to repay Newcastle for sticking with him in times of turmoil and what better but to give it your all in a relegation battle?

Barton is recovering from a injury suffered at City when we went down 2-1, needless to say we went downhill after Barton's departure. We've missed a extra bite in midfield with Nicky holding his own but Nolan looking nothing like what he was at Bolton. Danny Guthrie has looked very good indeed but is only recovering from injury too. We hope that Joey will be back for the Pompey game along with JosÃ© Enrique where we will need to get another 3 points. What will happen to Barton in the summer is still unknown as he might just depart from the club against his own will but for the time being he's an important figure that's about to return and try keep the mighty club that is Newcastle United safe from relegation.
