### Shearer - Has full backing of board and fans

You know where you were when you heard it, when the news broke that the great Alan Shearer, once Newcastle captain and highest goalscorer to date, had taken charge of a beleaguered Newcastle United football team. I was just about to depart to bed thinking about the upcoming Chelsea game and how we could combat the likes of Lampard and Essien in the center. I got a text from a friend telling me 'Shearer new Newcastle boss' including a (:O) face at the end. It being the 31st of March it would come as no surprise to me if it was all an early April fools but it wasn't the Mike Ashley had really offered Big Al the job.

I was delighted and I believe that Shearer is the only man who can save Newcastle United from the dungeons of the Coca Cola Championship. The honeymoon lasted for about 23 hours for Shearer, although he didn't soak all the fame up, he's not that type of person. It was back to serious stuff the next day, indeed the day he was confirmed manager. On Saturday Chelsea were coming to St.James' park and we all know how that turned out. Stoke City are Big Al's next opponents and how sweet a win would be there. We threw away a 2-0 deficit earlier in the season and gave away a last minute goal to a former Magpie too. However this is now, Stoke are our next obstacle and we **have** to win. No other manager can have the same effect as Shearer, no foreigner could save this boat. It's in his and his players hands. Let's hope this mighty club is saved.
