### Bassong - Has been a great signing for Newcastle

Our best center back all season Sebastien Bassong is fully backing Shearer and says he has brought a much needed lift to the club. Bassong himself arrived from Metz for a fee of £750k has turned out to be not only Newcastle's best defender all season but probably one the of the best finds in the premier League all season. His partner Fabrizio Coloccini hasn't lived up to the pace and expectations of the Premier League following his £10.3m move from Deportivo. However he has played in all games this season for Newcastle, perhaps that is why we are where we are 🙁

Bassong said :

_'I knew him as a great player, I have seen him on the TV.'It is a good thing. We need a manager and we will see what can happen.'_

Everyone knew Shearer, what a player he was, never failed to disappoint and yet again has decided to come and try save his beloved Toon. He is the real Messiah, helping us when we need it most. He has already had a huge positive impact on the players. Let's hope their performances improve too.

Comments appreciated 🙂
