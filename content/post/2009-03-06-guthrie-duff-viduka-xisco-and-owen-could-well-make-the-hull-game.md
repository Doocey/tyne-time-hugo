###Â Guthrie - Missing in midfield for some time now

Good news today as it is emerging that Xisco, Duff, Viduka, Owen and Guthrie could all return for the vital clash against Hull, a fortnight tomorrow. It is still unknown whether Beye will make the trip as he is recovering from one of Lee Cattermole's many terrible challenges this season. Barton, Beye, Digard,and more recently Scott Parker? Perhaps just a little too common in his poor tackling?

But back to our recovering injuries, I must say I am a big fan of of Danny Guthrie and to have him back is brilliant, mind you he has chipped in with a couple of goals this season too, one at Pompey and the other at Wigan. Costing a mere Â£1.5m, Guthrie has been up until his injury a very important member of the Magpies midfield , often times alongside Barton or Butt. But more importantly, our safety in the Premier League is the major talking issue, with Bassong already saying some players are getting worried of the teams position in the league.

All I can say is, that we'll stay up, and hopefully have that confirmed fairly soon too ðŸ™‚ Hull is such an important game at the minute and should results go our way we could well be in a more comfortable position for the time being at least. Just to note, Blackburn are picking points up on the road which isn't nice to see but hopefully we'll pull clear and our true quality will shine through. Remember, Joe will be back soon and the dressing room will change, that's for sure.

Keep the faith ðŸ™‚
