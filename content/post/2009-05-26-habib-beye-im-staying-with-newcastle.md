### Beye - Hoping to get Newcastle promoted

Although we have been relegated there is some great news today, as much as it expected people still didn't expect it, it you know what I mean. In an interview today Habib Beye said that by no means is he leaving Newcastle United even though they will be playing Championship football in August. Speaking today he said how much he loves the fans and the club plus how he has no intention of leaving NUFC in their time of need. To any Toon fan , this is great great news. He will be an inspirational leader in The CCC and more than decent at Rb/ CB too 😀 Speaking to the Chronicle he said how disappointed he is and he knows there's a long road ahead of them.

Beye said :

The players who will be here next year must put this club back in the Premier League.” “I’m in – I’m a Newcastle player.”

> _“I’m sad like everyone else.” “I’m under contract, and I will be here next year to put this club back in the Premier League.”_
>
> _“I have played for Newcastle for two years, and I love this club.”_

> _“Everyone is responsible for this situation. Every player is responsible.” “I think everybody must understand it’s not just about 11 players, or 18 players._
>
> _“It’s about a city and the fans, and a lot of who work at this club.” “It’s hard to think about.”_
>
> _“Newcastle is a massive club, and what can I say? We’re really, really sad. We must look forward, and if this club is in this position, it’s for some reason.”_

I for one am delighted with this news. Damien Duff, Steven Taylor and now Habib Beye have confirmed they will wear the Toon jersey next year.

Comments appreciated 🙂
