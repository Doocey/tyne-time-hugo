### Beye - Believes that Toon can survive

Prominent wingback and makeshift center back Habib Beye believes Newcastle United can remain a Premier League club if they manage 7 points from their last three games. That's the equivalent of 2 wins and a draw, Fulham and Boro spring to mind as possible wins with a draw away to Villa next priority. Whether we can really get 2 wins in succession is beyond me or anyone else who follows football but you'd have to doubt it. However the ever optimistic Habib Beye, who is a fans favorite believe that 7 points can be their lucky number.

Indeed this is probably the most important Tyne-Tee match ever and could well decide the faith of either team, perhaps it could decide both fates if a draw is the end result, somehow I think there might just be some goals in the tie. I certainly hope so, and hope for all 3 points on Monday night.

Comments appreciated 🙂
