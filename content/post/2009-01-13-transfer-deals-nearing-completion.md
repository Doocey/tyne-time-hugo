## Kinnear - Looking for extra funds

Newcastle United are in the final stages of completing two loan signings as they look to bolster the injury ridden squad. Kinnear who spoke to Sky Sports confirmed that they were in advanced stages with the two players who are Argentinian and Italian, respectively.

Joe said : __

_“We’ve agreed a loan deal for two players, two expensive loan deals, again through the end of the season, because of the crisis we’ve got injury wise.”

“I’ll possibly know about these within 48 hours, and if that is AOK we may be in a better position for the Blackburn game.”_

The fact that the loan deals are 'expensive' may indicate that these players are of decent quality and may be a surprise to us Toon fans. I'm not getting too excited though because I'm guessing they are not the youngest and have  played quite a bit of football. Number are key now, with another first team player injured today in training, annoying for this to happen to Joe and indeed us.

Kinnear has also indicated that he has called an 'emergency' meeting with owner Mike Ashley and chairman Derek Llambias about more funds needed, this coming from more injuries today, We hope the meeting was successful on Joe's side and we hope he has been given extra funds at his disposal, the meeting will be revealed tomorrow noon we suspect. Giving funds to Kinnear would be a win win situation for all of us, Ashley will have made a step to reconciliation with the fans, Kinnear will get more players and we'l be happy that the boss has been given funds at least 😀
