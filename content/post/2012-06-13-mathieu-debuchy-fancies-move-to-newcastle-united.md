####Â Debuchy - A good friend of Cabaye's and supposedly fancies move to NUFC

A report in the Journal by widely respected journalist Mark Douglas has revealed thatÂ Mathieu Debuchy - one of Newcastle United's number one targets this summer - fancies a move to Newcastle, and is ready to shun interest from the likes of Inter Milan to complete a move to St.James' Park. Debuchy, who was arguably the best player on the park when France drew 1-1 with England a few days ago at Euro 2012, is catching the eye of a lot of other clubs in Europe, and there's even talk  that Arsenal might be interested as well. Alan Pardew did try to get a deal agreed before the Frenchman jetted off to the Euro's in Poland and Ukraine, but was unable to do so. Debuchy will decide on his future after the tournament.

If Mathieu is willing to waive off interest from other clubs in order to sign for Newcastle United then it really reinforces not only what a season we've had in the Premier League, but how highly thought of we are in France. Lille of course, on the other hand, won't be too eager to accept offers for Debuchy, as their bank balance makes for pretty reading as is.

The sale of Eden Hazard brought about â‚¬40m to the club, and add that to the sales of Gervinho to Arsenal last season, as well as our own contribution of Â£5m for Yohan. It might be worth noting that Lille won't be too keen to sell to Pardew and company again, following their exploitation of Cabaye's release clause - which a lot of other clubs _didn't even know existed_.

If we manage to sign Debuchy this summer, and Vurnon Anita - I will be a very happy man. We've already lured Romain Amalfitano who is a prospect for the future, so personally, I cannot wait to see who else comes through the doors of St.James' Park before the start of the new PremierÂ LeagueÂ season.

A lot of might not take much heed, but we have also signed a number of youth prospects - one teenager who has arrived from Slovakia.Â ObviouslyÂ the scouting/youth recruitment team see what they like in the youngster, and that is most definitely enough for me!

A back four of -> Debuchy; Coloccini; Taylor; Santon/Anita <- makes for very exciting reading. Anyone else with me?
