### Lads - A good performance tonight should secure a precious 3 points

Around this time last year Newcastle were looking into potential fixtures that would bring them up the table and secure safety. This time around, we're looking at our game at home to West Bromich Albion as key match where the Coca Cola Championship will take a huge step in churning out winners and promotion candidates with Newcastle hopefully finishing aloft the table come

 May. If we ever faced an important game it's tonight, in St.James' Park, at home to Roberto di Matteo's West Bromich Albion. Tonight's the night for 'heroes' or whatever you'd like to call them.

The likes of Kevin Nolan, Alan Smith, Steve Harper & Shola Ameobi will prove very important against what'll be a good West Brom side. di Matteo's boys know the stature of this game and he'll have them well drilled. I'm sure their young team will prove quite the cocktail for out lads.

Chris Brunt is set to return and ourselves will more than likely be without Peter Lovenkrands following the sad death of his father. We hope is Rests In Peace.

I really can't stress the importance of this game enough. Some might say it's not really that significant but I assure you it'll be looked back on as a deciding fixture and what 'might have been if we managed to win'. Hopefully it will be the Brom fans saying that.

The game is live on SKY SPORTS 1 and on HD as far as I know so you'll have no excuse to not watch the Magpies in action, or if you're a West Brom fan, watch the Baggies launch their forces against Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor ðŸ˜€

We're hoping for a good game and more importantly a good win. I'll be a very happy man if we defeat West Brom tonight, and I'm really confident we will.

**Tyne Time's Prediction :** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newcastle 2-0 West Brom</span>
