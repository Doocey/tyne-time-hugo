![Fabricio Coloccini ](http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/horror%20hair%20fabricio%20coloccini.jpg "Colo - Has done well in this division but yet to convince us in Premier League")

A division down and a better looking Coca Cola Championship table. A better looking defence and a far better looking goal difference. However, don't be entirely convinced, our players haven't just found magical form this season. One man who has caught the eye of many is Fabricio Coloccini and his improved performances this season have been a welcome relief. Let's not forget  though, this guy cost Â£10.3m and at one stage, played every single game in the La Liga with Deportivo la Coruna. Fair enough, he's been a lot better this season but I don't think he's worth anywhere near his Â£60,000 a week wages.

Come the Summer, I'm sure there'll be teams in for Fabricio and it wouldn't surprise me if he left. When we got relegated, Coloccini was the first expected out the door of St.James' Park. However, that didn't happen and he continued in the Coca Cola Championship, performing as one of the best in the division mind.

However, I'm still not too confident about Coloccini's Premier League quality. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but we can't forget his nightmare season when he first arrived on Tyneside. His debut was the best he played that season, and his lack of pace is frightening to say the least.

No doubt he has improved a little but he's no youngster. He's getting on the wrong side of 25 fairly quickly and should we be offered near the Â£10m we paid for him, I would sell very quickly.

Now I'm sure a lot of you are in defensive of Colo and will refer to the severe instability at the club when he arrived, and no doubt it did affect his performances. That said, Coloccini is a former Depor and AC Milan man, he's used to big matches you would think but we paid an inflated fee for him, amongst many others.

Would you give him a shot at the Premier League should we get up? I certainly would, providing that no offer near <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Â£10p</span> Â£10m comes in for him. Either way, we don't know what'll happen to him until the summer so let's hope he keep scoring goals ðŸ˜€
