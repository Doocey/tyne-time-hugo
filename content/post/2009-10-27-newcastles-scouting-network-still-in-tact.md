### Scouting - And no that guy in the Toon top was never a scout

It's quite surprising really to think that Newcastle have a scouting system still in place while the club is trying to change owners. One thing Mike Ashley has done well besides pay huge amounts of money to small jobs, is trying at least to establish a youth policy at Newcastle. Some say it was to save him having to splash out on new signings, but we'll give him the benefit of the doubt  and say he has the best intentions in mind. Probably the most infamous scout of all has been Dennis Wise and his dealings with Kevin Keegan. I think we all know what happened there.

Today, Sky Sports is reporting that Newcastle were pondering around young Macedonian striker Agim Ibraimi. I think most of you will be saying who but the young forward who plays his football at Olimpija Ljubljana is rumoured to be the next big thing to come from there.

However, it doesn't really make much of a difference as he said today that he's happy where he is and the best of luck to him, he said :

> 'Newspapers are saying many things, but I'm still an Olimpija player.

> 'I'm happy in Ljubljana and would like to stay at Olimpija.'

However, I think the important thing here is, that we are still on the look out for players and that'll hopefully continue come January.
