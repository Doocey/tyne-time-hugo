###Â Lovenkrands - Sitting down for talks when manager is sorted

I know not many people will forget when Peter Lovenkrands placed the ball past Edwin Van der Sar to break the keepers clean sheet record. St. James' park erupted in shock but as the game went on Newcastle conceded twice and United got the 3 undeserving points. Today, Lovenkrands agent has said that Peter is set  for talks with the club over his future.

We'd all like to see Lovenkrands stay without a doubt because he was one of teh few players that gave it their all when they were on the pitch. He scored a few goals too Lovenkrands, against West Brom, Manchester United and in Newcastle last victory, Middlesbrough. Of course you'd expect other clubs to be looking for him too, we think Pete might just stay, especially because the fans love him and because Shearer will more than likely want him at the club. He'd be a very neat Championship player at the least.
