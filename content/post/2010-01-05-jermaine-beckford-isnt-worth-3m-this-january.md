### Beckford - Not worth more than Â£2.5m this January transfer window

Fair enough, he scored the winner against Manchester United in the FA Cup a few days ago, granted he's got 20 goals for Leeds United already and we're just leaving Christmas but Jermaine Beckford isn't worth the Â£3m Leeds United are reportedly looking for. With Newcastle expected to sign Beckford soon after submitting another, written transfer bid, it would be a risky  transfer if we ssplashed out near four million pounds on a League 1 striker. I'm sure some will disagree and think he's well worth every penny, but considering he's out of contract in only a few months, I don't think that, that kind of money should be thrown at the 6'4 striker.

Hughton is meant to have also bid for Matthew Kilgallon who, to be honest, will be less hassle to prise away from Bramall Lane. If you told any Newcastle fan two years ago that we'd be looking to sign Jermaine Beckford & Matt Kilgallon in the near future, they'd probably laugh at you and ask who Beckford was. However, that's what it has come to, and I'm sure there wouldn't be many complaining if we sign both of the lads.

Some are saying we should be looking to Kris Boyd and I must say, he'd probably be a decent signing. However Middlesbrough are extremely close to sealing a deal for the Scot or so reports claim, early this Tuesday morning. Either way the main focus is on Beckford throughout Tyneside and it looks as if Hughton will splash out Â£3m for the 26 year old striker.

Not worth the Â£3m if you ask me, but then again Chris Hughton is the boss.
