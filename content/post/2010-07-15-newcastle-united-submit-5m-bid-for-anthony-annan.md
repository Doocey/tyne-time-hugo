### Annan - Hughton has reportedly submitted a Â£5m bid for the Ghanaian

After browsing through Sky Sports transfer clock-watch, I stumbled upon a new enough update claiming that Newcastle United had bid Â£5m for Anthony Annan. The Ghanaian, who had a very good World Cup with the Africans is very much sought after, and whether this report has any accuracy or not remains to be seen. However, only a couple of days ago, Annan admitted that he  would love to play in the Premier League, but only after reported interest from Chelsea and Manchester United.

I really cannot see Annan moving to Newcastle because there will be many bigger clubs after his services. Although, saying that, stranger things have happened, and United & Chelsea may well have no interest in him at all.

The positives to be taken from this, if it's true, are that we have money to spend and a decent amount of it by the look of things. Secondly, we're going after the right type of player. Young, energetic and **good players** ðŸ˜€

We'd love a talent like Annan at Newcastle but I don't envisage him arriving on Tyneside, unless he'll be playing against us this season. That said, it makes for interesting reading, and the coming weeks will unravel, with hopefully a few more signings under our belts.

Comments welcome ðŸ™‚
