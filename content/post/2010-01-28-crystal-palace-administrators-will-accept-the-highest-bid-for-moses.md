### Moses - Would be a great signing from Chris if we could manage to pull it off

You have to credit Chris Hughton since taking over this summer. Not only are we top of the table, playing generally well, but for the first time in a while, we've secured 3 transfer signings in a couple of weeks. This is very good news and encouraging stuff to say the least. With Danny Simpson, Wayne Routledge and Mike Williamson already confirmed Newcastle United players , theres strong reports that Brimingham's Martin Taylor could be next on Tyneside. As well as this, to top it all off, Sky Sports understands that we also have lodged a bid for Victor Moses.

I'm sure you've all heard of Victor Moses, be it Football Manager or the many scouting reports out there. Linked with Real Madrid only a few weeks ago, Palace's financial crisis has driven them into administration and they have to sell all their 'fixed assests' so to speak.

The one that catches everyones eye is indeed Victor Moses, the 19 year old is the latest Crystal Palace youngster to emerge from the ranks, after John Bostock's move to Tottenham last year.

The Nigerian born lad has already played for the English U-19's and has a huge future ahead of him. With the Evening Chronicle reporting that our bid is well and truly submitted, you can't help but get a little bit excited at the prospect of the winger/striker playing in a Black & White shirt.

Time will tell, but at least we're making our interest known in these types of players. These are the exact mold of players we need at the club, young, creative and with a future ahead of them.

It's only a bid so far yet though, don't get too excited just yet ðŸ˜€
