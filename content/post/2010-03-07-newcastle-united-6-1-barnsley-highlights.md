In what was a very good win for Newcastle United yesterday, Monday morning sees us top of the Coca Cola Championship by 8 points and looking good for an immediate Premier League return. The attendances have been fantastic this season, putting many Premier League ones to shame including a club not very far from Newcastle. There's a lot of readers looking for highlights  of the 6-1 mauling of Barnsley and you can't really blame then. It's always nice to see our unbeaten home from continue aswell as the abundance of goals the lads are scoring. Long may it last.
