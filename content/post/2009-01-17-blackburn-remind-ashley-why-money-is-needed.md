## Ashley - Funds needed now as well in summer

Blackburn Rovers were victorious today in Ewood Park, a 3-0 defeat may have seemed a one sided game but Toon fans watching the game may differ, I included. The first half alone was ours, we dominated and should've gone into the break at least one nil up. Butt had an opportunity as did Owen and Carroll (who have his braids in his hair removed :D) however they failed to capitalise. Duff robbed the Blackburn defence in the first half and squared t to Butt, only for the veteran to miss. When Blackburn came out in the second they won't a penalty just after the hour mark, the referee Rob Styles pointing to the spot after Edgar allegedly fouled Benni McCarthy, a little harsh it seemed and that penalty rocked the Magpies.

Newcastle who were the only team playing football for the majority of the game were devastated to go one down and then the second came, quite a good goal it must be said. A little glimmer of hope was still there with 20+ mins left but on 86 Roberts wrapped it all up. Joey Barton who came on as a sub vented his anger towards JosÃ© Enrique following the third goal which was sad to see. Two teammates giving off to each other however we've been assured it wasn't anything serious, just the fact both players were so passionate about today's game, we certainly hope so. Some Newcastle fans showed their appreciation towards the team with a mini standing ovation although I'm sure it could be called other things ðŸ˜€ Another that caught my eye were two young lads on BBC after the final whistle shouting together 'Ashley Out, Ashley Out' which isn't nice to hear either.

With West Brom winning, Middlesbrough losing, Sunderland losing, Stoke losing (:D) and Blackburn winning it means Newcastle have slipped to 13th even with Sunderland on points and goal difference, what a difference derby say will make eh? Today's result perhaps as unjust as it was, it is a harsh reminder to owner Mike Ashley that he must give Kinnear enough cash to spend this January or else we could well be in for a nerve racking April May period.
