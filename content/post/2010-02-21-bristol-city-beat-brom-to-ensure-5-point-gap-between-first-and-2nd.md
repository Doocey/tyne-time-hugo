### Iwelumo - Scored the first goal in Bristol City's comeback against West Brom

The beauty of the Coca Cola Championship where every team can beat each other. Known more for his horrific yet hilarious miss against Norway a year ago, Chris Iwelumo today scored Bristol City's equalizer and their first goal in what proved to be a very pleasing comeback from Gary Johnson's men. For us, it's a very important win and indeed for Nottingham Forest's promotion  hopes too. We were 5 points ahead at the top of the table yesterday and today we're 5 points still, with the same amount of games played. So far so good without a doubt.

Now, I think we all remember vaguely that we once had a 10 point lead at the top of the table around Christmas and only last week, we were knocked off the top courtesy of goal difference. It just shows you how much things can change in a matter of a couple of games and thankfully, it's changed for the best for us Magpies.

Graham Dorrans have the visitors the lead just after the twenty minute mark in the game, which happened to be live on BBC1. However, just after the half-time break, two goals within 5 minutes saw Bristol regain full advantage and they didn't let their lead slip, even though West Brom had their chances to get something from the game.

It was a huge win for Bristol who have had a mixed season so far, however, they managed a 0-0 draw at St.James' Park earlier in the year and have the habit of playing well against the biggest teams in the Championship.

It's true to say that every team can beat each other but I'm hoping that we beat everybody from now on ðŸ˜€ The games will come quick and fast for us in the next few weeks and hopefully we can deal with them, an indeed get all three points from each encounter.

It will start all over again at Vicarage Road in under a weeks time and Watford will be a real test for Chris Hughton's Toon Army. Then again, with the fantastic support the Newcastle United faithful have shown all season, there's every chance that we'll bring home the precious 3 points.
