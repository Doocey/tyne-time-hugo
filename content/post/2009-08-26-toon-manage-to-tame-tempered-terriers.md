![Players - Doing us proud at the minute](https://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01470/kevin-nolan_1470069c.jpg)

Well in what was quiet an exciting game to say the least, Newcastle United managed to overcome Huddersfield Town. Goals from Shola Ameobi, Danny Guthrie, Geremi (I know ðŸ˜® ) and Kevin Nolan sealed a great comeback for the hard-working lads. Indeed that'sÂ  what they did, they worked. Although we had to introduce our first teamers, it was quiet a good performance all round by the little Newcastle squad. The much talked about, Nile Ranger played the game and did quiet well in what seemed to be a 4-5-1 formation from stand in boss, Chris Hughton.

I'm not writing a match report for you guys because there's plenty of them floating across the web, but it took a Kevin Nolan goal, five minutes from time for Newcastle to progress to the next round of the Carling Cup. At one stage in the game, Newcastle were two goals down, an early goal from Danny Guthrie set things off, but two goals from Huddersfield's' finest within five minutes helped the visitors to quiet a healthy lead.

On an important note, it is reported Jonas GutierrÃ©z and Shola Ameobi went off injured, but we're not how sure them reports were. Either way, we don't want to lose them duo because both are doing very well in the Coca Cola Championship for us.
