Newcastle will visit Preston North End on Monday in a game that could prove very important come the final stages of the Coca Cola Championship season. So far it's been pretty decent from our lads as we are top of the table and are nearly half way through a strenuous season. Sunday will see us visit Preston where we'll attempt to get another three points but I can guarantee you it won't  be an easy task. Preston are quite a good team and are realistic promotion contenders and have been for quite a while now. Their manager Andy Irvine is confident that they can grasp something from the game.

If we can manage another 3 points on Monday then it will see our quite good record away from home continue having already beaten Sheffield United, Ipswich Town, Crystal Palace and so on.

Pressure must be put on the Preston defence from the very first minute and us ourselves must be pretty tight at the back if we're to get anything from this game. Somehow, I've a feeling there'll be quite a few goals at the end of the ninety minutes.

As long as we score more than we concede then I'm happy. ðŸ˜€ West Brom are at home to Bristol City which should be an easy win for them as Middlesbrough entertain Nottingham Forest on Teeside.

I'm just beginning to recover from what's been a week to forget, Ireland being cheated out of the World Cup in South Africa and so forth. Hopefully the lads in Black and White will put a little smile back on my face ðŸ™‚
