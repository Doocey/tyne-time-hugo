### dos Santos - Would be a great signing for Chris Hughton & Newcastle United

Watching the World Cup so far, I've mainly been impressed by two teams, and one of them was not England. Argentina and Mexico have both had a real go at the competition and it's unfortunate that the Mexicans had to meet Maradona's side in the first knock-out round of the competition. A very offside goal from Carlos Tevez knocked spirits in Javier Aguirre's camp and they  never recovered. I can only imagine what a real game it would have been should the goal have been ruled out, however, I could talk all day about goals that shouldn't have stood if you get my drift.

Mexico were very good in the World Cup, drawing with the hosts on the first day of the tournament, and indeed beating France in emphatic style. Besides a very bright Carlos Salcido, a certain Giovani dos Santos has caught my eye. This is a guy who has been playing at Ipswich last season, Spurs the season before that and Barcelona before that again. However, he's been a real joy to watch at the World Cup in South Africa.

His movement, his pace, his ability on the ball and his real work-rate impressed me so much in the last few weeks. Even when they trailed Argentina 3-0, he chased every ball down near him and worked for the team.

Now, whether he's going to have a future at White Hart Lane under Harry Redknapp remains to be seen but a loan deal for the upcoming Premier League campaign would surely be arrangeable?

I'd love to see the Mexican at St.James' Park next season and it's not that much of a longshot if you ask me. He needs game time, we need young players with some flair and that can get beyond players, seems a perfect match. Saying that, I'm sure we wouldn't be the only ones interested if we were interested in him at all.

What do you lot think?
