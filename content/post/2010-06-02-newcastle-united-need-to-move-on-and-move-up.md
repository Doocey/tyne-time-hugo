### Bullard - Off to Celtic apparently in the next few days after Toon snub

In my rare free time, I've been keeping an eye on the latest Newcastle United news and the players that we have been linked with in the last few weeks. From Hamit Altintop to Jimmy Bullard, Kris Boyd to Dedryck Boyata. The rumour mill is alive and healthy that's for sure. The one that really sticks out though is the possible signing of Nedum Onuoha from Manchester City. The  pacy right-back or centre back is being linked with a move away from Mancini's side after failing to break the first eleven. To be honest, I think he'd be a great signing - but it ain't gonna happen.

Realistically, we have very little - if any money to spend thus summer. I believe that we won't be spending this summer at all and will rely on some loans and perhaps some prudent free-transfers.

Kris Boyd has been heavily touted to line up in a Toon shirt next season but manager Chris Hughton says he knows nothing about the rumour. That said, Boyd would be a realistic target and one that we could do with. A free transfer, average wages. We could give him a go, and if it doesn't work out, sell him to a Championship side or back to Scotland for some profit. Win-Win.

Now, on top of all this, I see we're being heavily associated with Jimmy Bullard, the Hull City midfielder who suffered multiple injuries since arriving at the KC Stadium and inevitably - relegation.

I wouldn't touch Bullard with a 20-foot barge poll to be be honest. He's getting older, injury prone and likes his high wages. (Sound familiar?) He left Fulham because he couldn't agree a new contract and joined Hull City because they offered him a nice weekly wage, a very nice one I may add.

No doubt the lad has ability, but I really hope he doesn't arrive on Tyneside. I can't see it happening but many Newcastle United fans are disappointed that we didn't look for him, although there are contrasting reports today saying we were in line for the English international.

Rumours are rife that he'll be a Celtic player in the next few days and that'd please me. We need young players, energetic, Nedum Onuoha type. Â players that want to play for the club and bring it up the ranks. We have youth to bring up and nurture fully - Bradden Inman, Haris Vuckic and so on.

Let's forget the transfer rumours, if players arrive, they arrive. Let's concentrate on the looming Premier League with the current bunch of players and lets bring this mighty football club onwards and upwards!
