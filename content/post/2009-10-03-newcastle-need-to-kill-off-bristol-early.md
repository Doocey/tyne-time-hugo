### Maynard - In good form for Bristol

Our problem this year in the league so far, bar the game at Portman Road, is leaving it too late to kill off games. We saw it at Leicester, Plymouth and indeed in our last game against Queens Park Rangers where new boy Marlon Harewood was on hand to tap home, with twenty minutes remaining. The thing is, we should have games done and dusted before 60' and against  QPR if we were to have taken our chances then it would have been more than a comfortable victory for Newcastle. However the lads seem a bit jerky playing in front of their home crowd, which is understandable.

Today we face the challenge of Bristol City who haven't had a bad campaign this year. Their man we need to watch is Nicky Maynard (pictured) because if he's given time and space he'll punish us, like any half decent striker will do.

If we get playing early and nab a quick goal within the first ten minutes then we're in a good position. If we can go in to the half time break with a two nil lead then we're in the driving seat. Then, grab another goal in the 2nd half and it's over, simple as that.

Whether the lads will do that I'm not too sure but we know they'll try their utmost and really, we can't ask for much more. One thing's for sure, there will be many a Geordie raring them on come 3pm.

**Tyne Time's Prediction** : Newcastle United 3-1 Bristol City
