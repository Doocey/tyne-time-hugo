![Newcastle United](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01470/kevin-nolan_1470069c.jpg "Newcastle - Have the ability to shrug off the competition in the league")

Although we're not playing well of late and far from our best form, I know for a fact that Newcastle United can win this Coca Cola Championship. In what's been a pretty quiet day for the Toon, I've decided to voice my often accurate and professional opinion on Newcastle United's promotion hopes this season, and the many questions that are being thrown at us Magpies in the last  couple weeks or so ðŸ˜€

A lucky point against Swansea City yesterday for sure but a precious one all the same. To say we're slipping and losing our grasp on the Coca Cola Championship trophy is absolute nonsense. 1 loss away to Derby was our first in 15 and that alone is quite an honorable record.

We've the meanest defence in the Championship and a strike-force that can score goals. Peter Lovenkrands, Andy Carroll and even Kevin Nolan who practically acts as a 3rd striker, have all notched up nearly double figures for the season so far.

Nottingham Forest have lost 2 in a row now and have failed to capitalize on our little blip of late. However, West Bromwich Albion, led by Roberto di Matteo are doing their utmost to knock us off the top of the the table and had managed to in midweek, only for our point in Wales to restore us to the summit of the Championship again.

It's my opinion that we will win the league this year and based on our squad, we really should be doing so. We've still far too many players on too much a week at St.James' Park but that won't change until the end of the season.

Our next couple of matches happen to be at home to Coventry and Preston, two sides picking up in form in the last month or so, Chris Coleman's Coventry City in particular.

It's worth noticing we took Leon Best from Coventry and wouldn't it be lovely if he managed to score a couple against his old team at St.James' in three days time ðŸ˜€

We have the players, the ability, the setup and the dare I say it, the manager to win this league and I'll be remaining confident we can indeed win this league. Many a time in 1996 that was said and it didn't work out for us but hopefully this year will be different, 14 years later.
