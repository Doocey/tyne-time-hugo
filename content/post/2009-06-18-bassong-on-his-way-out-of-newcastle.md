### Bassong - Best player for Newcastle this season by far - 22

Earlier this month Bassong said he wanted to leave the mess at Newcastle United and it seems he is destined to do so. Sky Sports have confirmed that Sebastien Bassong is  in talks with 2 English clubs to return to the Premier League. Bassong was Newcastle's best player of the season last year and it's not surprising to see that he's in demand. Rumors suggest Arsenal, City and Villa are all after him. To him, a move to any of those teams would be a dream on for the young French lad.

Speaking today he said :

> 'I have started to negotiate with two English clubs,' he told Aujourd'hui Sport.

We'd wish Bassong all the best at his new club and I'm sure he won't have a problem finding one. It's always one of the low earners that leave too , eh?
