###Â Jonas - Rejoins his high-flying club

Jonas Gutierrez in midweek secured his longest dream, of bringing Argentina to South Africa and indeed he himself, played a major hand in the deciding goal against Uruguay. Although he only won the free-kick which led to the goal, he looked quite sharp at times and the oppositions full-back found it quite difficult to keep taps on the 'greyhound'. Tomorrow, Jonas is expected to  line out in Nottingham where hopefully he'll play his part in a win for Newcastle United. Now that his Argentina future is secured, there should be only one thing on his mind and that's aiding Newcastle's promotion cause.

I suppose you'd have to be quite surprised Maradona has opted for both Jonas and Coloccini in his Argentine squad but it's suited us very well indeed with neither looking to leave, although is might have been better for the books if either had.

Jonas Gutierrez is Maradona's 3rd name on the team-sheet just behind Lionel Messi and Liverpool's JavierÂ Mascherano. Now that Jonas has achieved his dream albeit it under huge pressure from the media, and indeed the natives, his main goal we suspect is to bring NUFC back to the Premier League.

The winger could be instrumental for Newcastle this season and we might even see some goals from him. Seeing that Spiderman mask would be very nice indeed. As for his compatriot Fabricio Coloccini, he could well start tomorrows tie at Forest.
