![McMahon - Confirmed Newcastle bid](http://www.nufcblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/profitable_group.gif)

The Shields Gazette is today reporting  that Profitable Group, headed by Steve McMahon had made an official bid for Newcastle United Football Club and that possibly they are the front runners to gain control. Speaking today to another newspaper, called The Strait Times that the bid has been made and it would be a very good outcome for all parties concerned. As you know McMahon is a former footballer himself and obviously knows the ropes, or so we hope.

McMahon said :

> 'We've had a bid, it's under serious consideration,'
>
> 'It's a strategic move and it'll be great for the group and for Newcastle.'

So that confirms that the takeover won't be completed by Saturday in time for Shamrock Rovers v Newcastle United but it may indicate that this is, the much talked about foreign interest.
