![Hughton - Has the players backing](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/8/23/1251027575740/Chris-Hughton-Newcastle-U-001.jpg)

Chris Hughton enters today's game in the Welsh capital with Manager of the Month accolade under his belt and with Shola Ameobi after claiming player of the month for the Coca Cola Championship as well. If Newcastle manage to beat Cardiff today, then they'll return to the summit of the Coca Cola Championship and Hughton's fine managerial experience will continue. I think most Toon fans have taken Chris for granted but there is now, the serious possibility that Mike Ashley will appoint Hughton manager on a full-time basis, should he fail to sell the club.

One man who thinks that this would be a good idea is Newcastle's very own Steven Taylor, speaking today he was in full support of Chris.

He said :

> “Would I be happy to see Chris Hughton get the job permanently? Yes, he’s done brilliantly,”
>
> “He’s definitely strong enough to do it and he’s got the best out of the players here.”
>
> “He deserves his Manager of the Month Award. We all respect him. A lot of the players would love him to get the job.”
>
> Well if most of the players would love him to get the job then I say appoint him and clear the uncertainty around Newcastle. It seems Alan Shearer's hopes of managing Newcastle this year will not materialise and neither may the sale of the club to Barry Moat. Things are never simple at Newcastle United. Howay The Lads!
