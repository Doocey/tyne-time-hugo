![Hughton - Doing a very good job](http://i30.tinypic.com/25pms91.jpg)

Chris Hughton has given us the clearest indication yet that more players will leave at Newcastle and as well as that, new faces are set to arrive. As the transfer window closes very very soon, Hughton is braced for new arrivals and as reported last night Gareth Bale is rumoured to be extremely  close to sealing a move. However, the only problem is, his wage demands. At Spurs, Bale is meant to be earning 45k a week and let's be honest, that's far too much for a lad his age. The thing is, he can do a good job for Newcastle if he arrives and is also pretty good from the free-kick spot.

If I could keep the Newcastle squad as it is now, I would. I wouldn't let anyone else go, but if hard pushed, Fabricio Coloccini would be my choice. I'd like to keep the likes of Enrique, Jonas and Nolan, but conveniently enough, they are the players linked with leaving.

I really hope that we get new in faces and Chris Hughton, speaking today said he expects a 'flurry' of activity.

> “I would be very, very hopeful of that.
>
> “Come Tuesday at 5pm we are looking to have a squad that is able to compete.
>
> “I suppose you look at the squad today and you think if you get a couple of injuries it will test the squad even more so.
>
> “But everybody is braced for a hectic day on Tuesday – some more than others.
>
> “It will also settle the players down as well.

Jay Simpson has also been linked this morning and I would also that to happen. As I've said all year, we'll just have to see, but the results on the pitch are easing the anxiety just a little.

Comments welcome
