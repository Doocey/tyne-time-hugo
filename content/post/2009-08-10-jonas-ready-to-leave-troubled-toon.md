###Â Jonas - Ready for Greek move

Some may be delighted to see the guy go, he's been labelled everything from a headless chicken to an astounding dribbler but either way he wants out of Newcastle, and sooner the better. I suppose  I can't blame Gutierrez too much for leaving and I believe that he'll be a very good player in the years to come. I'll never forget that performance in Old Trafford when he caused real havoc for United, indeed most Toon fans will never forget that, managing a point but not only that, Fabricio Coloccini having a great game too. Speaing today though, Jonas has the intention to play abroad and the sooner the better.

Jonas said :

> 'On Thursday my agent called me and told me about the interest of Olympiakos,'

> 'He told me that he received a call from Olympiakos' people, who asked him if I wanted to play for them.
>
> 'I told my agent that I wouldn't say no to Olympiakos if they are going to make a good offer to me.
>
> 'Of course, everything depends on Newcastle. I have four more years contract with the English club and Olympiakos must agree with them first of all.
>
> 'My agent told me that the upcoming week is going to be crucial. He is expecting a new contact with Olympiakos on Monday.
>
> 'I know about Olympiakos and that they are a huge club. They are the Boca Juniors or the River Plate of Greece.

Olympiakos are good but surely he'd prefer a move to the Premier League? Champions league must come to mind for the Argie.

> 'For me is a big challenge to play the Champions League. I have a lot of energy in me and I want to make a fantastic season in order to be with my national team in South Africa for the World Cup.
>
> 'I want to leave Newcastle and go to a club which will give me the chance to fight for this place in my national team.
>
> 'I believe if I play well in the Champions League then Maradona is going to take a look at me.'

There it is, another Newcastle player as good as on his bike. We need new players, will we ever get them?
