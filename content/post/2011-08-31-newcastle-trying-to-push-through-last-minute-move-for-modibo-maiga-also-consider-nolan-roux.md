####Â Maiga - Desperate to join Alan Pardew's Newcastle United today

Modibo Maiga has been desperate for a move to Newcastle UnitedÂ sinceÂ the day they expressed their first interest in him. He has hadÂ quarrelsÂ with the board, refused to play; dropped from squads and all the likes - but still he remains a Sochaux player as we approach the final seven hours of the summer transfer window. Despite the signing of a much needed full-back in Davide Santon, NUFC still  haven't added a striker to their ranks to add to our collection already. This is the most worrying thing, we really do need a different type of striker to what we have at the club at the moment. Modibo Maiga was meant to be that striker. However, it's all too familiar to us trying to keep hold of our best striker if possible. You would think that their board is holding out for the best price possible but there's a slight problem: so are we.

It's understood that we're about a couple million apart in our valuation of the Malian forward. Adding to the fact Sochaux would actually like to keep him on their books. Whilst Alan Pardew, Lee Charnley & Derek Llambias work tirelessly (or so we're led to believe) - another option is available should the Maiga move fall flat on it's feet. That option is another Ligue 1 player - by the name of Nolan Roux.

he was offered to newcastle United last week for â‚¬8m and it's an offer that the board are considering, and will activate should they fail in their pursuit of Modibo. In all honesty; I'd probably rather Roux because I've seen him play, and haven't had the joy to watch Maiga. With that said, there's also a difference in the price tag. Roux is going for about Â£7m, and if we're to believe reports - Maiga's fee or required fee is closer to double figures.

We've also had a Â£10m bid rejected for Freiburg forwardÂ Papiss Demba Cisse this morning but the German club insist that the Senegalese international is stayign put. Pardew has quickly shifted his interest back to Maiga - but as mentioned above; could well end up activating Nolan Roux's release clause should time be on his side. However, that's the big question - will time be on his side?

11PM tonight the window slams shut, will we have a permanent striker in by then? Only time will tell I suppose.

If you fancy getting yourself a deadline day deal on sporting goods or on football boots in particular then pop over to Sports Direct. The folks were kind enough to give me a pair of new Adidas Predators to try out and I must say; the boots are pretty impressive. I wasn't convinced by the new design at first but after having a kick about with them on, they're pretty easy on the feet, lightweight and well designed it has to be said. It's always handy to have a pair close; in case you get a last minute call tonightÂ askingÂ you to sign for AlanÂ Pardew!
