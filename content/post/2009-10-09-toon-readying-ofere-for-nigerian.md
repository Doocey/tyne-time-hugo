![Ofere - Hughton reportedly interested](http://gfx2.aftonbladet-cdn.se/image/12008646/480/normal/cc94ee0f48081/edward+ofere)

Towering Malmo centre forward Edward Ofere is reportedly ticking the interest of current Newcastle United manager, Chris Hughton. The 6'3 Nigerian who has played more than a couple of times for his international side was scouted by Toon staff and their reports back to Chris were positive. Whether we need another tall and rumbustious striker is debatable with  Ameobi, Carroll, Nile Ranger all on the books already but the reports on this lad are very interesting indeed. He's highly rated within Nigeria and indeed within Sweden where he plys his trade.

The move is meant to be organised for January (if going ahead) and the fee it meant to be a large Â£2m, which is a very considerable amount in the Coca Cola Championship.

However, the face Keegan has got some spare change out of Ashley and that we've slashed our wage bill as well as selling some of our finest assets means that Hughton may well indeed have some money to play around with.

Whether Mike Ashley will be in charge come January ( we certainly hope not ) is another thing but either way the former Irish international in Chris Hughton, is expected to receive funds in the region of Â£5m.

Edward Ofere isn't the only player he's looking at though I'm sure, as we look to strengthen between now and indeed January.
