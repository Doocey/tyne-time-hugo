### Targets - Hughton is confident they'll arrive

According to surfacing reports and the many of them, Jermaine Beckford and Matthew Kilgallon will be signing for Newcastle United in the January transfer window. Both 'The Killer' and Beckford have been lined with possible moves to Newcastle, since the start of 2009 but no move materialized for either of them. Kilgallon, as well as Beckford are in the final months of their  respective contracts and Chris Hughton is hoping to get a bargain on both of them. However, Newcastle's don't have it all to themselves, it's also being reported that numerous other Premier League clubs are monitoring the pairs situations.

Speaking today, Hughton said :

> _“I'm pretty confident that by the end of this window we'll have added to the quality of player we have here,”_
>
> _“We are certainly looking to bring in the two or three faces that we feel we will need to go through the rest of the season and hopefully that will be sooner rather than later.”_

There's no doubt that Chris does indeed want to bring both of the lads to Newcastle and he's being backed by Mike Ashley financially on this one. Last year Llambias said that Hughton would be given necessary transfer funds to find some new players.

It certainly seems as if Marlon Harewood will not be returning to Newcastle following his loan stunt at the club. The striker does want to join again but according to rumours, Villa are demanding £250,000 for his loan, on top of his near £30,000 a week wages.

If we do manage to sign both of these players in the next few days then I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy as it seems that the majority are well receptive of both Beckford & Kilgallon arriving.

We might be surprised though, perhaps we won't get any transfers at all! Somehow I think that Chris isn't lying though.

Comments welcome & A Happy New Year 🙂
