### Shearer - Loving role as manager

Although he's probably in the most pressurizing job in the Premier League, local lad Alan Shearer says he's loving life as manager of his boyhood team. Newcastle travel to Stoke in hope for all 3 points but as much as Shearer says he feels the pressure, he says life as manager of Newcastle United couldn't be better. There isn't as much pressure on him as there would be on Kinnear as Shearer is a legend and will forever have that status on Tyneside. Shearer speaking to a local paper today said it's really a great experience and he's enjoying every moment of it.

“It’s been a good week and one I’ve enjoyed, hard work and long hours.

“The response has been fantastic from the local people and the players.

“Their attitude towards what we’ve tried to put in place and change has been positive.

“Training has also been upbeat.'

“It’s important we changed one or two things.

“We’re third bottom for a reason.

“People can make excuses for all sorts of reasons and it’s up to us to get out of it.

“We go in on Saturday with great hope and confidence.'

Looking ahead to Stoke, he added: “It’s imperative to get something.

“We’ve got a late kick off and things might change.

“But we’re going there for three points.”

“What the players have done is put in a good shift this week and hopefully taken some confidence from what they’ve done.

“We’re looking eradicate silly errors from our game.

“To do that you need to concentrate for 90 minutes, sometimes 95 minutes.

“There will be a lot of long balls kicked into our box.

“We have to be big enough to handle that.'

Shearer knows the task on his hands but he also knows he has a little room to breath amongst Toon fans.  Keeping us up will only improve his status  with us and we all have confidence that he will
