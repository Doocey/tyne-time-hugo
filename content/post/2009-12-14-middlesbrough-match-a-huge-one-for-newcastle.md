###Â Taylor - Lets hope he's on target again this year

It wasn't a good year for North-East football last year for sure, with us and Middlesbrough taking the drop to the Coca Cola Championship and Sunderland just about surviving the final few pressurizing games. In a game we needed to win and I'm not talking about Aston Villa and _that_ day but rather of the game at home to Middlesbrough where we got what many people thought  was the three points which would've kept us up. I must say, honestly, I wasn't one of them. I need that we'd mess up again somewhere along the road and at home to Portsmouth happened to be it, for me anyway.

Now, both us and Middlesbrough are in the Championship and both looking in decent shape of late. Middlesbrough have had a mixed season, getting rid of Gareth Southgate and appointing Gordon Strachan. They've seen some mixed results so far,.

Our campaign so far has been pretty flawless but that's not to say we'll be under immense pressure against Middlesbrough, and more important our rivals come the 20th of December.

We're at home and hopefully that will see us beat Middlesbrough in what will be a real tests of this squads ability and nerves for sure. It will the first time in a long time we've come up against a former Premier League force and the rivalry in the sky, will no doubt ensure an exciting encounter.

Not to mention the bragging rights of course ðŸ˜€

Comments welcome.
