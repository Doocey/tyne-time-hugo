![Ranger - Volleyed home last night in Coventry](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/8/6/1249580886043/Nile-Ranger-001.jpg)

In a good display from Newcastle United last night, Nile Ranger at long last got his first senior goal for the Toon Army and the travelling fans. The icing on the cake came with only a few minutes remaining, Enrique crossing for his second assist of the evening before Ranger, between two defenders prodded it home. Hopefully this goal, which has been a long time coming, will spur  on a huge goal fest. Also, the return of Shola Ameobi saw him grab one straight away after taking a prolonged break due to injury. The Nigerian striker from 12 yards pelted it in to the top corner.

Now with a seven point gap between us and West Brom, and even more between 3rd and the rest, it's important that we keep up this good form and indeed push it home. We can't give up now, we're only starting really and I'd like to see our winning streak continue away to Barnsley on Saturday.

If we can keep winning then West Brom will surely mess up somewhere along the way, or we certainly hope so and we can push the boat even further out. Bare in mind West Brom have to come to St.James' Park and play us yet, after we played them at the Hawthorns on the first day of the season, Duffer the scorer.

If Ranger keeps scoring, Ameobi regains full fitness, Nolan comes back and Carroll sorts out his matters with the club a nd the law, there's a very good chance we could be in a healthy position come May of 2010. You can never be sure though, and especially with Newcastle as I've said so many times.
