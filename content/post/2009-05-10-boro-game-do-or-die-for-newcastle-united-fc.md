### Shearer - Hoping for early goal tomorrow

Tomorrow is the night for the biggest game in Newcastle's long long history. indeed history will be made at 10pm on Monday night when either the Toon or Boro could leapfrog Hull and reside outside the relegation zone for at least another week. Then again if both team happen to draw than their fate will more than likely destined for the Coca Cola Championship and that is a place where no team want to go, especially teams of Newcastle and Middlesbrough's size. It's been some time-line for Newcastle fans to endure but hopefully, just hopefully we'll be a Premier League team even at the end of all this.

When Keegan resumed control, all was merry, he even turned Newcastle around on the pitch, saving them from relegation and it seemed we were in for an exciting season under the 'Messiah's' control. How much things have changed. Keegan resigned, Ashley tried to sell, Joe Kinnear takes charge, has serious health problems and finally, Alan Shearer takes control at his beloved club in a bid to save them from relegation. The story between Keegan and Shearer is near identical, Keegan took sometime to get his first win, and Shearer is yet to collect a full 3 points.

We hope Shearer can manipulate Keegan's story and save us from relegation, Monday is certainly a place to start. We've missed every other good opportunity, surely the lads can't mess it up again, in front of 50,000 roaring Geordies? 10pm Monday will provide us with our answer.
