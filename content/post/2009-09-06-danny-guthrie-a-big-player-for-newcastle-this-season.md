### Guthrie - Wants to continue his good form

Some say Danny Guthrie was Kevin Keegan's only signing whilst in charge of Newcastle United. However, it was a very good signing indeed. Guthrie who left Liverpool because of Steven Gerrards' brilliance, he himself is starting to show similar characteristics of the Liverpool captain. Although not a regular, when we were in the Premier League, Guthrie played well  any time he came no or started. Most people will remember the three nil victory away to Tony Adam's Portsmouth, with Guthrie scoring the third, a curler into the top hand corner.

This season the Liverpudlian (although born in Shrewsbury) has hit the Coca Cola Championship with a bang. Scoring in Newcastle's win over Huddersfield in the Carling Cup, he followed it up with a scorcher versus Leicester City which can been viewed on the right hand side of the page.

We can't really fault the effort of the Newcastle players this term so far, but they do, and they know it, owe us. We were embarrassed last year, not all the players fault, but of the disastrous owner that's still in charge, Mike Ashley. However, poor performances from the players let us down even further last season, which inevitably ended in us being relegated from the Premier League.

It's my opinion that Danny Guthrie is going to be a very big player for Newcastle this term, providing he stays fit. With himself and Joey Barton alongside Smith, that's a pretty hard midfield for any Championship team to break down. We hope we get more stunning goals from Danny like the one on Monday, and he's pretty confident he'll deliver.
