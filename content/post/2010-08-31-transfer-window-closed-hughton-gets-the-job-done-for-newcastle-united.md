Five players signed, and a job well done by Chris Hughton and co. James Perch, Dan Gosling, Sol Campbell, Cheick TiotÃ© & Hatem Ben Arfa all signed for Newcastle United,a nd four of those on a permanent basis. The pick of the bunch really is a coin toss between Dan Gosling and Hatem Ben Arfa, but the fact Ben Arfa is fit and ready to go unlike his counterpart, perhaps shades  it for the Frenchman. On top of that, we have the option to buy Ben Arfa for Â£5m after 25 games, which could a brilliant deal if he can perform anywhere near his potential whilst here.

A lot of people expected a couple of signings today, especially cover for the left-back area. However, it didn't come, not that it was that much of a surprise. Robbie Keane, and Ricky van Wolfswinkel were both linked with moves but again, nothing more happened. With Leon Best, Shola Ameobi, Nile Ranger, Xisco & Peter Lovenkrands all able and ready to partner Andy Carroll up front, you can see why Hughton wasn't too pushed on recruiting a new striker. Also, James Perch can play at LB, and even Shane Ferguson, so again, there isn't an absolute emergency for cover here.

I am personally happy with the way things have panned out. We managed to recruit two extremely talented and highly rated youngsters in Dan Gosling & Hatem Ben Arfa and that's always a good thing. As well as that, we need some youth to be given a chance and not crowded out, the likes of Haris Vuckic, Bradden Inman, James Tavernier and Ryan Donaldson to name but a few.

All in all, aÂ successfulÂ transfer period from Hughton, and a lot more than expected when that infamous statement of 'no capital outlay' was released by the club before the start of the season that's for sure. Roughly about Â£6m spend in this window. Not too shabby at all.
