### Martins - How we'd love to see the famous somersaults

Obafemi Martins has today said that he has had to turn off his television because it makes him sad to see Newcastle's state of affairs. He today confessed that he was an amid fan of Sky Sports programmes and relished to see how other teams got on, however he now insists that he won't be dragged into viewing the TV for the sake of NUFC. Martins is a massive figure for Newcastle and is received well amongst the, he is also playing through the pain barrier to help keep Newcastle up, but I'd do the same for £75,000 every week 😀

Martins said today :

> “I don’t look at Sky Sports right now.
>
> “I used to enjoy it to see how other teams got on. But I just want to focus on Newcastle United right now.
>
> “Only our results count at the moment. If we are doing well it is fun to spend time watching other teams.
>
> “I look at everything, but at the moment we don’t need to. If I tried doing it now it would just make me sad.”

We need goals right now, and Martins is someone who can score them. He has a habit of scoring against the bigger teams, United, Arsenal this season and said he plans to score again v Liverpool

> “You just try to get on with your job. All I am thinking about is scoring against Liverpool.
>
> “I hope to score against Liverpool. I did against Arsenal and Manchester United this season.
>
> “I also scored against Liverpool two seasons ago at St James’s Park.
>
> “We’ve had difficulties lately but if we go there positive, there is a chance.”

We aren't expected to get anything from Anfield but what a pleasant surprise it would be if we did.

Comments appreciated 🙂
