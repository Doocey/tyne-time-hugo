### Enrique - Flattered by Madrid interest

Speaking today Jose Enrique said he was flattered by interest shown in him by Atletico Madrid and indeed other clubs across Europe. Enrique who had a dodgy start to his Newcastle career has since shown in stages, why he cost £6.25m but still, it seems we got a little  ripped off again. Big Sam Allardyce bought him when in charge but Keegan and Shearer seemed to get the best out of him. Enrique did say, if there wasn't any teams interested in him, he'd stay at newcastle and play out the remaining years on his contract but it was a 'come and get me' call more than commitment.

Enrique said :

> “They (Atletico) are one of the major teams in the Spanish league. Who would not want to play for a club like that? I think that any player would want to pull on their shirt.”
>
> “Atletico are a big club with a big budget and great fans. They also have a great squad and have finished in the Champions League positions for next season.”
>
> “I do still have three years left on my contract with Newcastle, but I am pleased and flattered to be linked with them.”
>
> “I have watched them quite a few times this season and always follow the Spanish league. They have had a good season with (Diego) Forlan, who I knew at Villarreal.”

He continued to say :

> “If I am honest, I do not have a preference about which country, I am open to anything,”
>
> “In Spain people live well and eat well, but I have enjoyed my adventure in England.”
>
> “The Premier League is the best in the world and I would study anything that came up.”

If that isn't a come and get me plea to bigger clubs in Europe then I don't know what is.

Comments appreciated 🙂
