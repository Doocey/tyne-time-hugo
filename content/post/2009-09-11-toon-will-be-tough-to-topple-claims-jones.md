![Jones - Cheer up Dave! Its not all bad news](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01015/dave-jones_1015597c.jpg)

Sensational Cardiff City manager, OK, maybe I'm being a bit over generous with him, but it's Friday! Anyway, Dave Jones, the Cardiff City manager was speaking today about their chances against Newcastle United. Cardiff who are doing very well themselves and Toon old boy Michael Chopra banging in the goals, they couldn't have wished for a better start. Neither could we  though, grabbing 13 from a possible 15 and the draw happening on the first day against promotion favourites, West Brom.

It's been a good start from both sides and we've both had a nice rest, whilst the international games were being played. Luckily, we suffered no new injuries and Jonas, is making good progress on his recovery trail.

This game is a real test though and we can expect a very attacking outlet from the Cardiff boys come kick-off. If we manage to curtail Michael Chopra and keep Ross McCormack quiet, then there's every chance we could continue our 7 ours without conceding a goal.

However, I think there will be goals in this game and hopefully resulting in us retaining our 1st position in the table. Cardiff are well aware of who they're playing and are well informed on our abilities.

Dave Jones said :

It seems he knows what we're thinking and is 100% correct in saying everyone wrote us off, besides our loyal fans.

However, he made no mistake is stating his ambitions are to win, and to indeed knock Newcastle off the top of the table.

> “They will want to stay there but we want to knock them off and get with them.”

So, we'll just have to see, the game is being shown live on SKY and kick-off is at 2.05pm.

**Tyne Time's Prediction:** Cardiff City 1-1 Newcastle United
