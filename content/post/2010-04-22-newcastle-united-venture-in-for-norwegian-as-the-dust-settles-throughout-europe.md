![Erik Huseklepp linked with Newcastle United again](http://static.vg.no/uploaded/image/bilderigg/2006/05/10/1147288526924_395.jpg)

Vital Football, who's reliability is questionable for transfer stories have today revealed that Chris Hughton and co. made contact with Norwegian side FC Brann regards their little superstar with the name of Erik Huseklepp. This guy has been linked a fair few times to Newcastle and it's believed that in the early hours of Monday morning Chris Hughton picked up the telephone  and enquired about the tricky forward.

We're making our transfer plans already which is good to see but if we do indeed making a formal offer for Huseklepp, I'm sure we'll be surrounded by other clubs looking to take the Norwegian off FC Brann.

We are a Premier League team again thankfully and our home game against Ipswich will see us lift the trophy in front of 50,000 fans +, or we'd like to think that we'd get an attendance somewhere in that region.

Some smart buys, offload a few players and hard work. If we can manage all 3 of those tasks then there's every chance we'll ve a Premier League team still, come this time next year.
