### Bassong - Attracting a lot of interest

It's understood, amidst all the takeover speculation and Shearer saga that Newcastle United, have rejected a Â£10m from Tottenham for Sebastien Bassong. Sky Sports are now reporting this story and if  true which we believe it is, Â£10m is a lot to reject for someone we only paid Â£500k for last summer. Harry Redknapp is no doubt interested as are Arsenal, and Arsene Wenger has a good lot of cash now that Kolo TourÃ© and Emanuel Adebayor have departed to cash filthy Manchester City. The bid is believed to be from Spurs but it's clear Newcastle United either want more for the talented centre back or they want to keep him, for the Championship campaign.

The question I'm asking is, who is rejecting these bids? Obviously it's the same person who accepted the Â£9m from Wolfsburg for Obafemi Martins and it seems that he knows what the price is of players. We doubt it's Derek Llambias, or Chris Hughton, so who is it? We said we might have new owners by tomorrow or there about Â and maybe it's a new figurehead taking control of the team affairs. It couldn't be Kevin Keegan could it? Somehow I doubt it. Indeed whoever is making these decisions mean there is something going on behind the scenes and that some sort of progress has been made. Martins is gone and now Bassong is on his way more or less. If Spurs up their bid for Bassong in the region of Â£12-15m then I think the board or whoever it is, will have no hesitation in accepting it.
