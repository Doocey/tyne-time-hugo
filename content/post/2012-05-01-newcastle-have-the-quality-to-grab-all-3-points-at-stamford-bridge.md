Heading to Stamford Bridge in the past has been a daunting task no doubt, but of recent times we've enjoyed quite a decent spell in the Blue side of London. Last season Shola Ameobi and even Nile Ranger scored in a Newcastle United win in the Carling Cup, and towards the very end of the Premier League season - Steven Taylor popped up with an injury time header to snatch a dramatic last-minute point to send the traveling Geordies into raptures. Somehow - under AVB  - Chelsea managed to beat us 3-0 at St.James' Park; a result that looking back on now should not have happened. As we approach Wednesday's encounter, there is far more at stake; a potential Champions League spot beckons for the winner of the tie. An incentive much?

We face an entirely different team to the one that showed up on Tyneside last year. Fernando Torres is beginning to find his goal-scoring form again, form that once had the Spaniard as the most feared forward in the game not too long ago.

Defensively, Chelsea have tightened things at the back big time. Under AVB, they conceded quite a lot but now, under the leadership of a certain Roberto di Matteo, they run a tighter ship.

For Newcastle, we're still in dreamland. Despite a disappointing, and indeed humbling defeat to Wigan Athletic - who played some 'Barcalike' football on the day - we still have a very strong chance of making the Champions League. All we have to do is win our next three games and hope that Spurs fail to the do the same. Not _that_ hard is it?

The best thing about it all is that if we ever had pressure on us away to Wigan, we certainly have no pressure on us now. We're already in Europe which a lot of fans tend to forget. St.James' Park will welcome European football again, for the first time in a long time. Of course all of us are eyeing up the Champions League and it's hard not to, but we can only take one game at a time - starting with Chelsea on Wednesday.

Being the optimist I am, I honestly believe that we can grab all three points in London. The team are determined to put things right after the events at the DW Stadium and with a tantalizing forward line in Ba, Cissé & Ben Arfa, there is no reason why we can't score a few goals on the night.

Our defence will have to be on song if we want to come away with the win though - Williamson and Coloccini have a tough task ahead of them if they want to keep the physical presence that is Didier Drogba, and the reborn Torres, quiet.

I think we'll get chances on the night and don't be surprised to see a few goals fly in, in either end.

We've nothing to lose, and everything to gain - let's go at them from the start!

What do you lot think, can we sneak a win from the capital? Tell us in the comments box!
