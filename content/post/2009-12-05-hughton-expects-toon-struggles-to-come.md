### Pancrate - Nice pelter today against Watford

Although Newcastle won again today against a rejuvenated Watford side, Chris Hughton is adamant that tougher ties await and that Newcastle will not escape as easily and they have done. Speaking today after a 2-0 home win against Watford in which saw new boy Fabrice Pancrate get his first in the Black and White Hughton said that tougher games await and that Lady Luck  won't shine on them as brightly as she has. Saying that, we'll never refuse a little rub of the green will we?

Hughton said :

'If I look at what we have managed to achieve so far this season, we are always very keen to point that one out.

'There will be bad times to come, I am sure, but we have shown a lot of resilience and that is the mark of any side which is doing well, that resilience resulting in clean sheets. I am absolutely delighted with that.'

We don't like the sound of that but we understand that, because we'pretty much used to bad luck, however, hopefully it's more of a wake up call to the players to start killing games off, if they can.

He continued :

'What we do know is we are going to have good days and bad days, and what we have so far shown is a resilience to cope with the bad days and, at times, get something from them.

'There are times when you can't speak highly enough of the group of lads you have, and that applies today.'

Well said Chris, well said. On another note, it was good to see Lovenkrands grab another goal and indeed see Fabrice Pancrate smash the top corner with two minutes left to play.

If we can keep that up past Christmas and hopefully see West Brom keep losing points like they did today then you just never know what could happen.
