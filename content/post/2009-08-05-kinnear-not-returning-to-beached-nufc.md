###Â Kinnear - Clearly hasn't taken the news well

Phew! That was a close one. Most fans were about to cry when they heard Joe Kinnear could be returning as Newcastle United manager but  David Craig and his 'sources' at Newcastle have confirmed that Kinnear will **not** be returning as manager. However it's understood that Mike Ashley as Derek Llambias visited Joe Kinnear checking up on his, asking whether he was ready to return to football. It's understood that Kinnear said he wasn't and that it'd be about two months away. So it's believed Newcastle will be sold at the end of this month and Kinnear will not figure as head coach of the Toon.

This news is greeted with relief from Newcastle fans because it's 'thanks but no thanks' to Joe Kinnear returning as manager. I think that if Joe was manager through to the end of the season, we would've  stayed up but that's Newcastle United for you. Joe could do a good job but I don't think the fans would welcome his back. There's only one man we want and that's

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">David O'Leary</span> Alan Shearer. Shearer being appointed as manager looks very unlikely now though.
