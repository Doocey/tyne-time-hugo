![Ashley - Cutting ticket prices to bring buzz back](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01349/mike_ashley_1349947c.jpg)

Good news today for Toon fans as Mike Ashley has decided to cut Newcastle's ticket prices by up to 9%. A change in price has been inevitable and receives a warm welcome to the loyal Toon fans. The fans of NUFC has been brilliant and I speak as an Irish man who sees St.James' beaming with Black and White, it's a great great sight and the players respect it so much. Although some can turn on the ownership or team, it is only because of the welfare of the club, lets be honest, we all want to see Newcastle United Football Club thrive.

Season tickets on a standard have been cut from Â£543 to Â£494 which is still a lot of money to say the least. On average the games will approximately Â£26 a game with Juniors attending for around Â£20 per match. Not a bad price if we see the Toon winning at SJP ðŸ˜€ Even better thing about Juniors is, they are pushing back the age restriction to 18 so more Teen Tooners will get in for less, a great move if you ask me ðŸ™‚

Derek Llambias spoke _again_ today ðŸ™‚

 _'At a time when money is tight for supporters, football clubs have to recognise the sacrifices people make to continue following their team and offer any assistance they can in making games affordable to watch.

'We have decided to reduce the majority of prices back to 2007/08 levels to help fans because we appreciate the big commitment they make in buying their season tickets every year.

'We are also further increasing the Family Enclosure and raising the age of the junior price concession to 18 because young supporters represent our future.'

_'It has been a tough season, nobody will pretend otherwise, but together we must all look to better times ahead.'_

No doubt Llambias and Ashley are making some long awaited progress and finally speaking to the media. Keep it up and hopefully the team will keep going up too ðŸ™‚

Comments appreciated ðŸ™‚
