###Â Kilgallon - Staying at Bramall Lane until end of the season

Chris Hughton will now have to readjust his January transfer target and his main man, Matthew Kilgallon has said today that he's staying put at Sheffield United. Kilgallon, who was expected to make the move to us this January has opted to try and push for promotion with the Blades and reassess his options in the summer. In fairness, you've to credit the lad there, he wants to  stay and hopefully achieve promotion with manager Kevin Blackwell. That now rules Kilgallon out of the Toon scenario and as Chris Hughton said earlier, he wants to sign a striker and a centre back, I wonder has his ambitions changed?

His agent said :

> _'We have spoken to Kevin Blackwell to say Matthew is fully committed to Sheffield United until the end of the season,'_
>
> _'We have also informed Newcastle United about the situation._
>
> _'Matthew is keen to win promotion with Sheffield United, if that happens we will re-assess the options in the summer.'_

Perhaps now Hughton will look elsewhere or we certainly hope he does because I doubt Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor will stay fit for the remainder of the season. I'm sure you'll hear many new names being touted about and I wouldn't be surprised if a few loanees arrived instead.

We can't fault Newcastle on this one, they acted quickly to get their bid in and Matthew simply wanted to stay. Good to see there's some loyalty left in football yet.
