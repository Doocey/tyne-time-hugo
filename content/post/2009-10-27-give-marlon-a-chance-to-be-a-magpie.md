###Â Harewood - Needs to be give time to adjust

Marlon Harewood's great start in a Newcastle United shirt by scoring the equaliser against QPR seems like a distant memory now as the physical forward is beginning to irritate the Toon faithful. In the game against Doncaster Marlon didn't play a blinder by any means but labelling him as a 'donkey' is really justified as of yet. Arriving from Aston Villa on loan, theÂ  forward was brought here to score goals but it looks as if they'll be few and far between. However, saying that, we can't get on his back just yet, give him a chance. He can score goals and we certainly hope he will.

There's no doubt that the lad has been a bit awkward on the ball so far but it's also known that he can score goals, and he has done this, at Premier League level. Confidence is a huge issue too, and it's pretty clear that Marlon isn't brimming with self-esteem just yet.

All I'm saying is to give the man a chance. I know there's plenty of fans out there that aren't jumping on his back just yet, but to those who are, remember, he's only on loan and I very much doubt that he'll sign permanently.

Hopefully he'll reward us with a brace against Sheffield United in a four nil win. ðŸ˜€
