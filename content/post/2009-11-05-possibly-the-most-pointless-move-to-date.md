###Â St. James' Park - 'New' name utter nonsense

They insist that the new name is to bolster revenue for the club, and for Chris Hughton's transfer pot. However, naming it Ashley's own company brings us absolutely no funding and you don't have to be a mathematician to figure out that it means no cash for Chris in January either. Maybe I'm wrong and that there will be some cash injected from Sports Direct but in all fairness , there would need to be. The stadium has been 'renamed' until the rest of the season which is another brainless move as it has no impact whatsoever for the club except trying to hinder the history of the famous theatre.

I can't understand it really, they want extra money and they go the fans most prized possession, and mess with it. Any owner who does that really has be questioned. I'm really guessing Mike got his idea from Dave Whelan at Wigan Athletic.

Even so, it's, as my headline suggest a very very poor move from the hierarchy at Newcastle and if Chris isn't given funds in January to bolster the squad then there'll be absolute uproar, added to the already very uneasy Â  atmosphere.
