Before Newcastle United completed the free transfer of Demba Ba, they tried their utmost to lure Kevin Gameiro from FC Lorient. However, PSG showed an interest and ended up signing him. As we all know, the Parisian side were bought over by a rich tycoon and since have done a bit of a 'Man City' on their domestic league, and have bought up a lot of quality players. The likes of Pastore came first, and this summer, Napoli's Ezequiel Lavezzi joined the French side. Since then, Gameiro hasn't seen a lot of action and wants a move away from Paris with quite a few  clubs interested in the 25 year-old.

Newcastle United had a Â£10m fee agreed for his services, and presented him with a very good contract, however, he opted to stay in France. Despite not featuring very much, he still nabbed 11 goals in 32 appearances which is an impressive feat and clearly has an eye for goal.

We are just wondering whether Kevin might still be on Alan Pardew's list of potential forwards? He is still a young player and would fit our transfer policy. As well as that, he would be available for a couple of million less than what we were going to pay for him a year previous. Somewhere in the region of Â£7.5m - Â£9m would be enough to tempt PSG into selling him, although I don't think they'd need very much convincing at all!

Valencia were reportedly close to signing him a couple of weeks ago, but there hasn't been any confirmation or any more developments in that situation (unless I'm missing something).

Gameiro would cost less than de Jong, and although the Dutchman is considerably younger, I'd be more inclined to part with Â£7m for a 25 year old who has already scored bucket loads of goals in France, then Luuk who hasn't had much exposure outside of his own country.

If would not surprise me one bit if we made an approach for him, and I've a feeling that this time, Gameiro would be extremely interested in a move to St.James' Park.

What do you folks think? Despite him turning down a move last season, would we take him this time around?
