![Alan Pardew looks on during Newcastle's Premier League encounter](http://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Alan-Pardew-Newcastle-2014-Premier-League.jpg "Pardew - A very unpopular man amongst majority of Newcastle United fans the past 12 months")

There are very few professions in the world that people often pray/beg/call for the sacking of an individual from his day job. Politics and football are an exception, and these are two things Mr. Alan Pardew is well used to both at Newcastle United since taking control in 2010. One could be forgiven for looking in from the outside and coming to the conclusion that Newcastle fans can never be pleased; after all Pardew was the same guy who led the Magpies to brink of Champions League football in 2011/12 only to miss out in the final two games. It could also be argued that Pardew is working in a difficult workplace under a stringent ownership led by the one and only decision maker: Mike Ashley. However, while all that is true — Pardew has done nothing but anger, disappoint and ultimately dishearten even the most optimistic of NUFC fans in the past 18 months or so.

The ill-feeling directed towards the former Crystal Palace midfielder was reflected a poll taken by _The Chronicle_ a few days ago which indicated that a strong 85% of the 5,000+ Toon fans wanted Pardew gone. You may even wonder the point of me putting a question mark in the title of this post when reading the previous line, but quite obviously - I cannot speak for every supporter, and there are without doubt a handful of fans still pro-Pardew.

One could write a book on the tenure of Pardew (and such a publication will likely come to fruition in the coming years when all the dust settles) but the footballing tragedies are well documented on a new site aptly named [SackPardew.com](http://www.sackpardew.com "Sack Pardew") I advise you check it out, even if you are still in support of Alan managing this football club.

My question is, if Pardew did manage to lead this club to a stretch of fine results, could Newcastle fans accept him once again and forget about his countless misdemeanors in seasons gone by? As I tweeted a few days ago ([@KevinDoocey](https://twitter.com/kevindoocey "kevin doocey") if you're not following!), even if AP guided Newcastle back to the Champions League at the end of the season, I would still have him replaced the following morning. Harsh, but he has outstayed his welcome on Tyneside, in my opinion at least.

With that said and done — has Alan Pardew reached a _real_ point of no return? I certainly hope so, but what do you think?

Comments welcome as always!
