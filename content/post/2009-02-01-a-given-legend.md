### Shay - Best of luck in your new career

It's official, Shay Given has left us, after 11 long years and 11 long days he's a Manchester City player now. The fee is undisclosed but anything short of Â£10m would be a disgrace bar Â£9.75m + a couple of players that is ðŸ˜€ Shay made over 450 appearances, including 354 Premier League starts, during a distinguished Newcastle career and he has amassed 91 caps for the Republic of Ireland to become the most capped Irish international goalkeeper.

Mark is obviously happy with signing the EPL's best keeper:

_'I have said for_ _a long time that we need the experience of a keeper like Shay. I am delighted that we have been able to acquire such an accomplished keeper, and one is so highly regarded by everyone in the Premier League.</p>

'We are getting a very good keeper, and the experience he has will help the two outstanding young keepers that we have here in Joe and Kasper. I am looking for them all to grow as a group, and it's important that we have that influence of a senior keeper.

'I have had a good talk with him about where we expect to be in the future. From a football point of view, and a club point of view, it's an easy thing to sell because we know we are going in the right direction. Players want to be part of that._

Shay you will always be a legend, goodbye to you my friend ðŸ™‚
