### McMahon - Does Profitable have the funds to back up their interest?

After declaring their interest in Newcastle United Football Club Profitable are yet to make an official bid for the club and reports are suggesting that there is no funds to back up their interest. This is what Newcastle could do without, but we're still pretty confident  they'll make a bid for the club very soon. Newcastle need to be sold very quickly of else if could become a terrible terrible affair. We could go worse than Leeds, how could we let that happen? Steve McMahon, who is reportedly leading the line in his quest of NUFC is a former footballer and we knows he's serious about buying NUFC.

They said :

> 'The Profitable Group can confirm that it has expressed an initial interest in acquiring Newcastle United.
>
> 'A preliminary discussion with the representatives appointed to handle the sale of the club has been held, but contrary to some reports, no direct talks have been held with either the owner, Mike Ashley, or the chairman, Derek Llambias.
>
> 'The group consider the leaking of the Group's interest in this matter unfortunate, and as supporters of Newcastle United, seek only to serve in the best interests of the club, the fans and the local community.
>
> 'The group will not be making any further comment at the present time.'

Hopefully things will get sorted quickly and things will be put in place. However , when is anything straight forward with Newcastle United?
