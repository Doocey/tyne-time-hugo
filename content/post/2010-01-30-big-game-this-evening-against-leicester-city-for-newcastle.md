Derby County proved a tough test for us earlier this year but so too for Billy Davies men with Nottingham Forest losing one nil away to The Rams today. A decisive Rob Hulse goal secured all three points and in that relieving victory both Derby County and Newcastle United's Coca Cola Championship campaigns were given a boost. Although West Brom beat Sheffield United today it  means we can stretch the lead from Forest if we can manage to overcome a resilient Leicester City side tonight.

The teams lining up are as follows :

**LCFC:** Chris Weale, Michael Morrison, Wayne Brown, Matt Oakley (c), Andy King, Matty Fryatt, Bruno Berner, Martyn Waghorn, Richie Wellens, Paul Gallagher, Jack Hobbs

**Subs:** Robbie Nielson, Ryan McGivern, Nobby Solano, Steve Howard, Lloyd Dyer, Conrad Logan, Danny N'Guessan

**NUFC:** Steve Harper, Ryan Taylor, Fabricio Coloccini, Mike Williamson, Patrick van Aanholt, Wayne Routledge, Nicky Butt (c), Alan Smith, Danny Guthrie, Kevin Nolan, Andy Carroll

**Subs:** Tim Krul, Tamas Kadar, Jonas Gutierrez, Peter Lovenkrands, Nile Ranger, Fitz Hall, Fabrice Pancrate

The noticeable changes see Wayne Routledge start as well as fellow new boy Patrick van Aanholt. With Enrique injured, we hope the young Dutchman can do a good job tonight against Nigel Pearson's men.

The game is live on Sky Sports as far as I know so there's no excuse for you to see the Magpies in action tonight! Â Howay The Lads!
