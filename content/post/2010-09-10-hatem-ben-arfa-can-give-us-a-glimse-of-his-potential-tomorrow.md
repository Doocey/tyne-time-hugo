![Hatem Ben Arfa can give us a glimpse of what we haggled for tomorrow](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/8/8/1281280948258/Hatem-Ben-Arfa-006.jpg "Hatem Ben Arfa")

After weeks of haggling, and negotiations, Newcastle United finally managed to bring Hatem Ben Arfa to St.James' Park and indeed tomorrow the Frenchman will make his dÃ©but for the Toon. At home to Blackpool, the scene is set for Ben Arfa to do the business alongside his teammate Cheick TiotÃ© who also joined from Dutch side FC Twente. We can't really expect goals upon  goals from either, but hopefully tomorrow, we'll get a glimpse of what they can both do, and Ben Arfa in particular.

He has promised ammunition to Andy Carroll and if he can manage that, then we'd expect a few goals to fly in! Blackpool are certainly there for the taking and I'd hope for a 2-0 win. However, Holloway's side have got off to a decent start, which included a four-nil thrashing away at Wigan Athletic. There's no doubt they'll come to Newcastle looking to score and get the three points, but hopefully we'll just have too much for them. A performance along the lines of Villa at home three weeks back would be very suitable indeed! ðŸ˜€

I think Ben Arfa will excite people at St.James' Park tomorrow, if he starts, or makes an entrance into the fray. He will get the ball and run with it, and more importantly - run at defenders looking to break through their rear-guard. As long as he adds some flair to the side then we'll be happy, because we all know what he's capable of. He can be one of the best in Europe on his day, and that's not word of a lie.

Kick-off for tomorrow is at 3pm, so be sure to watch the lads hopefully get all three points in front of a near full St.James' Park!
