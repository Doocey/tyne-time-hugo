### Shearer - Appoint him now regardless of ownership

As the saga continues  were all getting sick of the same old news, the sale will be completed here there and everywhere. I'm taking my mind off the sale today and put together a list of players Newcastle United should sign as they prepare for their first Coca Cola Championship campaign. The main thing I can't understand and you probably can't either, is why Shearer hasn't been appointed manager as the takeover talks continue? Alan should be appointed, and a contract sorted out when the new owners take charge. I'm sure Al wouldn't be too pushy on wages and his presence would reassure players. Simple really, any ways, here's the list of 5 players that I think we should buy.

**Daniel Fox**

Coventry's Daniel Fox would be a very good buy for us, a tall LB, would replace Jose Enrique whether he stays or goes. Last season we only hadÂ **1** left back in the squad and he missed vital games, meaning Damien Duff had to fill his role. Daniel would cost about Â£1m and would be a very good addition.

**Jermaine Beckford**

Jermaine has already said he's wanted to leave and it's pretty obvious he would love to join Newcastle. His agent claims Newcastle is a 'big attraction' for the CF and we need to buy players who want to wear the Black and White. Available for around 500k he'd score goals and hopefully gain promotion, something he came so close to earlier this year.

**Elliott Ward**

Towering CB for Coventry, we could do a double swoop from the Sky Blues. Himself and Daniel Fox wouldn't need much time to settle and would groove together at the heart of the defence. Our back four has been the problem all these years and sent us down in some ways. Would take some persuading to come but I think he'd opt to play in front of 50,000 people.

**Chris Brunt**

Had a great season with a poor team last year. Would be a great signing to replace to departing Jonas Gutierrez, bullet of a left foot but would cost a considerable amount. Maybe even up to Â£5m and that's not to say there might not be Premier League clubs are him. Would he join Newcastle? If we sorted quickly and with Shearer in charge, he just might.

**Juan Carlos Menseguez**

Another player who somewhat shone for West Brom last season. Although he only moved in January on loan he showed glimpses of real Argentine quality including his goal v Sunderland. No one really knows if he's moving permanently to West Brom now that Tony Mowbray has left so we could move during the confusion and secure his signature. He shouldn't cost any more than Â£1.5m but we've to sort our mess out first before thinking about moving for him.

So there are my 5 ideal signings and hopefully many more to come if we actually get taken over soon. I'm sure you have your own opinions on who should arrive and more so who should leave. Do voice your opinion in the comments form below.
