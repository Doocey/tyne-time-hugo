### CissÃ© - Scored a brace for the third game in a row including a stunning second

It is hard not to sit back and relish Papiss Cisse'sÂ goal scoringÂ form for Newcastle United at the minute - what ever club you support in the Premier League, bar the obvious. Arriving from Germany for Â£9m - a little more than a quarter of Andy Carroll's fee - he has already notched nine goals in eight games. For strikers landing in the Premier League from abroad, it is accepted that some  take half a season to adjust to the pace of the division, and the physicality of the game. It certainly looks like Papiss settled the minute his plane touched down at Newcastle International Airport. A stunning goal on his debut against Aston Villa set the tone, quickly followed up by one at home to Wolves & Norwich. Immediately after, another six goals arrived in three matches - 2 against Liverpool, 2 away to West Brom and on Friday gone: a brace in Wales, against Swansea. It really doesn't get much better for someone hoping to fill the famous #9 jersey at St.James' Park.

In fact, his form is so good we've decided to make a wallpaper to acknowledge it!

9 goals in 8 games doesn't go unnoticed, and certainly not when a guy is doing it in a Black and White shirt.

Papiss CissÃ© celebrating in the Black and White Stripes - there's no better sight than it!

It's basic and it's meant to be.
