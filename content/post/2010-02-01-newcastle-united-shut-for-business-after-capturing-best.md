### Best - Takes the #20 shirt and Newcastle finish up their market activity

This time last year we anxiously awaited the possible signing of Michael Johnson from Manchester City but we were left empty handed, with only Kevin Nolan & Ryan Taylor to show for our troubles, in what proved to be a disastrous January transfer window. Now though, a year on, we've signed Wayne Routledge, Mike Williamson, Patrick van Aanholt, Fitz Hall, Danny Simpson and  now, Leon Best from Coventry City. The Irish international signs on a 3 and a half year deal for an undisclosed fee. If reports are to be believed, Newcastle have tested Leeds United resolve with a ladt minute bid for their prominent goal-scorer, Jermaine Beckford.

However, _Tyne Time understands_ that Sky Sports's David Craig has made it clear that Chris Hughton is finishing his Winter deal shopping. The only activity is on Wearside who will attempt and clinch the loan signing of Alan Hutton with rumours also rife that Benjani could get a last gasp move.

It's been a successful transfer window for Newcastle and more importantly we've got rid of Geremi **kept hold of our best players** in Kevin Nolan, Alan Smith etc.
