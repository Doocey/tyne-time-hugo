![Cheik Tiote's goal vs. Arsenal](http://www.tynetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cheik_Tiote_Against_Arsenal.jpg "Cheik Tiote scores a stunner against Arsenal")

One man who won't be short for money for years to come is our very own Cheik Tiote, after signing a new six and a half year deal with Newcastle United. TiotÃ©, who had been linked with moves to Chelsea, Arsenal and even Manchester United put pen to paper on a rather outrageous deal in allÂ honesty. It is one of the longest contracts I have ever heard of in football and if we're to beÂ realistic Â here, he will not see out those years at the Toon. You may think I'm against this new contract, but like any other NUFC fan; I'm happy that we've ended anyÂ interestÂ in him for quite a while.

First things first though; credit to Graham Carr and the Newcastle United scouting team for picking this guy out. He cost a meagre Â£3.5m and we'd easily get Â£10-15m for him tomorrow morning. Signed from FC Twente, the African has shown a real grit about his performances,Â reminiscentÂ of a young Michael Essien. Strength, tackling, man-marking are all high points to Cheik's abilities.

With that said, he needs to improve his discipline in order to progress even further as a footballer. If he picks up a yellow card today against Bolton Wanderers which I suspect him to then he'll miss our next two games, and he'll be a big loss in the centre of the park for our upcoming games against Everton and Stoke City.

Back to the point though. Cheik TiotÃ© today said he was very happy at NewcastleÂ UnitedÂ and wanted to stay there for quite a while, hence him signing a new shiny contract. However, if you're happy at NUFC then there should be no confusion as to whether you'll renew your existing contract or not. 6.5 years is a ridiculous contract to award someone, and its even more questionable when you up the guys wages by a staggering Â£32,000 or so, per week.

I'm a big fan of TiotÃ© don't get me wrong but there was noÂ purposeÂ for this contract besides hiking his potential selling value and of course its a gesture by Mike Ashley which he hopes will ease the Andy Carroll sale that bit more. Although, you can't blame him for selling Carroll whatsoever.

Will TiotÃ© see out this new contract? I'd very much doubt it.

Either way - if we sell we'll get a very good fee for him, and if we don't then we'll still have a gem of a player on our hands.

It's a win-win for NUFC really.

With that said, it will end any speculation regarding the man from CÃ´te d'Ivoire and that is never a bad thing.

We've also organised a prediction challenge with Leazes Terrace for the rest of the season.

Starting in todays game against Bolton, both sites will try guess the exact scoreline of the game.

3 points for the correctÂ scorelineÂ and result, or 1 point for predicting the winner alone.

Simple enough, and will add a bit more interest to the remaining NUFC games.

Starting off with Bolton at home, we have both gone for a **2-0 NewcastleÂ UnitedÂ win**.
