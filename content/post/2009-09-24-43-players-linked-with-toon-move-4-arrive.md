###Â Zurab - Only player not linked

In a special edition ofÂ **Tyne Time** we today look at the sheer amount of players that have been linked with Newcastle United since relegation and the ones that actually arrived. As you probably can figure, there's been truly rubbish transfer rumours put in our street and we've dealt with them. My headline is probably inappropriate and is far less than the actual figure but I've picked outÂ **43** main players that has been linked to the sacred Black and White jersey and some of them, will just make you laugh. The ironic thing is, the media, who make up about 84% of the rumours, Â have rarely ever predicted the actual players who arrived at Newcastle and their infamous sources seem to have deserted them. So here it is, a prestigious list, compiled by **Tyne Time**, of 43 players who never made the trip to Tyneside. Enjoy.

1. Even days after relegation the media produced an unbelievable rumour that **Raul** (yes the Real Madrid veteran) was about to make a move up North East, trading Sunny Spain for a temperate Tyneside.

2. Andy Griffin

3. Per Ciljan Skjelbred

4. Vegard Forren

5. Gary Caldwell

6. Aiden McGeady

7. Fraizer Campbell

8. Fitz Hall

9. Jack Rodwell

10. Michael Turner

11. Kamil Zayatte

12. Stanislav Varga

13. Franco di Santo

14. Dexter Blackstock

15. Jermaine Beckford

16. Sol Campbell

17. Ched Evans

18. Danny Shittu

19. Mike Williamson

20. James Vaughan

21. Michael Misfud

22. Gareth Bale

23. Andy O'Brien

24. Tommy Smith

25. Craig Cathcart

26. Matty Kilgallon

27. Jack Colback

28. Jake Livermore

29. Rob Earnshaw

30. Danny Rose

31. Solvi Ottesen

32. Michael Scharner

33. Titus Bramble

34. Caleb Folan

35. Daniel Cousin

36. David Healy

37. Paul Scholes

38. Aaron Hughes

39. Jermaine Jackson

40. Leroy Lita

41. David Wheater

42. Kieran Richardson

And finally probably the most bizarre rumour that I've heard in the last few months, was the report in one of the country's tabloids :

Joe Kinnear returning to Newcastle United as manager.

Sorry Joe, you did a good job while in charge but the chances of you returning to Newcastle (or being allowed) to were minimal, although an outburst at Simon Bird is always welcome ðŸ™‚

So there we are, 43 players linked and these are the players who actually arrived :

1. Danny Simpson (Manchester United)

2. Peter Lovenkrands (Free Agrent)

3. Zurab Khizanishvili (Blackburn Rovers)

4. Marlon Harewood (Aston Villa)

Although probably Marlon and Peter were linked extensively, Zurab's transfer came out of the blue really, Â but a pleasant surprise.

'Til Tomorrow
