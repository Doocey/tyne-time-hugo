Having arrived from Manchester United, it's been a very good spell for Danny Simpson on Tyneside. The defender endured a frustrating time at Blackburn and indeed needed a move away from Manchester before the nerves got the better of him. Simpson, who had figured in most of our Championship games so far is on loan but he insists that he's not counting the days until he returns to  United, far from it. In fact, Danny is keen to stay at United, Newcastle United. For me, I'd take him in with open arms, especially if the fee was in the region of Â£1-2m ðŸ˜€

Speaking he said :

> 'Obviously, I'm enjoying my football here, and if I do well enough to get an offer, then I'll consider it, as I'm enjoying my football at the moment,'

It's a good attitude to have and the fans of Newcastle will even take more of a liking to the lad with those comments. It's also good to see that the majority of Newcastle players are enjoying their playing time at the minute.

He continued :

> 'I just want to get as many games under my belt as I can until January. I've got no clue [what will happen in the transfer window] - I'm just taking it game by game.
>
> 'It's nice to be wanted and it would be nice at the end of the loan spell for Chris Hughton and all the staff to say they want me to stay.

Chris surely has been impressed by the lad, but he's not with Manchester United for no reason. However, it's believed that Simpson was loaned to Blackburn last season because of 'problems at his parent club' (Man Utd).

There doesn't seem to be many problems with him on the field and inevitably, that's the most important thing, especially when you play for a club like Newcastle.
