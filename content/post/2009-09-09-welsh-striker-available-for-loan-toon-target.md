###Â Vokes - Bound for Tyneside?

Sam Vokes, a prominent Sam Allardyce target during his short spell is being linked with a move to Newcastle United once again. The Welshman who was heavily linked with us last year could well be on his way to Tyneside after his boss, Mick McCarthy said he's more than willing to let the striker leave on loan. Wolves recruited talented Irish forward Kevin Doyle in the  summer and Vokes can't manage to push the other Irish striker Andy Keogh out of the team either. Vokes is a very good player, at Championship level at least and I wouldn't refuse him.

When asked about Vokes, McCarthy said :

> 'We'll see what happens when everyone gets back from the international duty,'
>
> 'Sam really needs to play some football.
>
> 'There was half a chance he could have gone out last week.
>
> 'For him to develop and for us to benefit he has to play regularly.

Sam would certainly get his fair share of games at Newcastle if the injuries last season were anything to go by.

However Mick McCarthy obviously hasn't been too impressed in what he's saw from Sam, although Vokes has been more doing his best.

> 'Sam has had a meteoric rise from Bournemouth and for him to improve he's got to play some football so there's a chance he can go out.'

So there we are, another transfer target linked and more rumours. Oddly enough, there hasn't been anything on the takeover, might just be a good thing.
