![Chris Hughton won't be bullied into heightening price for Beckford](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/8/23/1251027575740/Chris-Hughton-Newcastle-U-001.jpg)


Chris Hughton has today again reiterated his stance on Jermaine Beckford's transfer scenario. Hughton has made it no secret that he's after the 6'2 striker but insists that he'll neither heighten his price, or be forced to do so. It's believed that Newcastle have issued Leeds with an ultimatum, a bid of just about Â£2m, a take it or leave it offer for the Elland Road outfit. There's no doubt that  Beckford wants to join Newcastle and has even issued a transfer request to speed up his move away from Leeds if possible. Yesterday it was reported that Wigan & Wolves had joined the chase for the FA Cup hero but there hasn't been any developments on their side as of yet.

If Hughton's third bid is indeed rejected then he says he will look elsewhere, and we're glad. The likes of Nicky Maynard, Peter Whittingham, Billy Sharp,Â <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Brett Ormerod</span> and many others spring to mind.

Hughton said :

> _'We're not at the back end of the transfer window yet._
>
> _'In the ideal scenario you do your business as quickly as possible, but in most cases it doesn't tend to happen that way. That's the frustration this window brings._
>
> _'We'd rather do it nice and early, know what we have and go on from there, but that hasn't been the case._

It seems as if Kilgallon will be staying with Sheffield United until the end of the season which means that he can move on a free in the summer. Kilgallon is highly rated by most Newcastle fans and the majority of supporters were disappointed to miss out on him. It seems as if he'd be number one choice with Beckford second. No surprise really.

Hughton continued :

> _'There comes a time when we will have to look elsewhere.'_

I'd like to hear that because if I'm honest, Jermaine Beckford isn't my first choice, however I'm sure there are a lot of Toon fans out there who would love to see the former RAC worker pull on the Black & White of Newcastle.

> _'I can't see us failing to sign anyone this month, in all honesty. What I wouldn't want to do is say categorically that won't happen, but I can't see it.'_

So there you have it, in the most complicated way of putting it :D. Hughton says he expects us to sign someone and more than likely will, however there's still that little chance no one will arrive this January on Tyneside.

Sound familiar?
