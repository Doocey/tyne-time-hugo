###Â Beevers - Highly rated in English Football

It's being reported, and not for the first time, that Newcastle United could well be taking a look at Sheffield Wednesday's Mark Beevers. The defender who is a big 6'5 is meant to be attracting a lot of interest in not only the Championship, but also in the Premier League. Beevers received Player of the Season at Wednesday last year if memory serves me correct,and is only 20 years of age, and  with a huge amount of potential if reports are accurate. I'm sure a lot of you know about him, and especially from Football Manager, dubbed a a new 'John Terry' or certainly, with a very good potential rating.

Of course any defenders are welcome at Newcastle but with Taylor & Coloccini playing so well together at the moment, challengers will find it hard to break the two CB's up.

The question still remains if we are actually in the hunt for new players this January but if we want to secure promotion, we will need to add a couple more. Luckily we haven't had too many injuries (touch wood) and I hope that continues, because we need every player in the squad fit.

We've a long way to go in the Championship yet but some new faces, perhaps Beevers if we fail to get Matthew Kilgallon, could bolster our hopes for an immediate return to the Premier League.
