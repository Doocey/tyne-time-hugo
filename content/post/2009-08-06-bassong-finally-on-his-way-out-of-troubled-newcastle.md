![Bassong - Close to Spurs move](http://static.hugedomains.com/images/logo_huge_domains.gif)

After a long time of asking and constant speculation, last seasons best player is extremely close to signing for Harry Redknapp's Spurs side. Following Darren Bent's departure to Sunderland for  Â£10m it's believed that Redknapp will be using that money on Newcastle's prized asset, Sebastien Bassong. Bassong who signed for a mere Â£500,000k has proved himself in English football in his first season, shining out in a lacklustre Newcastle United side. Bassong missed our last game at Villa and was sorely missed, as we were sent down. With that out of the way and the new Championship campaign starting on Saturday we'll be almost certain to be missing Seb.

Harry Redknapp has said that he wants Bassong and Sky Sports are reporting that the transfer fee is in the region of Â£8m, not Â£10m. Why we would reject a Â£10m bid and then accept an Â£8m a few days later baffles me. I'm guessing there's plenty of add-ons based on performances and whatnot. Seb is expected to sign later today as he is doing a medical as we speak. Once personal terms are agreed then Sebastien Bassong is all but a Spurs player. We wish Bassong the very best of luck at Spurs (but not too much :D)

He's pointing the obvious out there but respects the fans at Newcastle and has acknowledged them. We believe there will be many more departures, maybe just as well.
