### World Cup - Answer a simple question and enter our competition!
After a long vote between either a World Cup jersey or a Vuvuzela , it's been decided that a jersey will indeed be the prize on offer here at Tyne Time. Over a year on the web now, Tyne Time has gained a lot of support from the thousands of Newcastle United fans online and will hopefully continue to do so, for years to come. To say thanks, we have an Argentinian Home jersey to raffle up, all you have to do is answer the simple question below, fill in the contact form, and send it away. If you're lucky, you'll have a brand new Argentina jerseyÂ arrivingÂ on your door step in the next few days.

The question is :

> _Who scored the final goal when Newcastle United beat Sunderland at the Stadium Of Light in the 1-4 in 2006?_

Easy as that! A little thank you from Tyne Time for reading and contributing to our 'blog.
