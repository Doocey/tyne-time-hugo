#### Dempsey - A brilliant player that has scored over 10 goals this season

I have been watching Clint Dempsey for a few years now and he continues to impress me. His flair, vision and ability to score goals is something that a lot of people have not recognised, and he has not got half enough praise for his endeavours for both his country, and for Fulham over the years. He would be right up my list of players to sign this summer although I'm sure Alan Pardew's wishlist would differ  quite a bit from mine! Considered an attacking midfielder/ striker or winger; Dempsey has notched up 12 goals this season, similar to our own Kevin Nolan, and has had a hand in plenty of Fulham's others. He would be a great signing for the club in my opinion but whether he would want to line out in St.James' Park is a very different matter.

Many Newcastle United fans will be hoping to make contact with the likes of Lille over Gervinho, Sow and even Eden Hazard, but I'm afraid we shouldn't be setting our hopes that high. Hazard is off to a big European team whilst Sow will have many suitors at this disposal. As for Gervinho, I get the sneaky feeling he might actually join us, although time can only tell.

Regards Dempsey; I think Mark Hughes has to be complimented on the huge strides he has made with his Fulham team. They lay 9th in the table and have a huge future under the Welshman. It's always good to see managers like Hughes and even Roy Hodgson, that have been sacked by the 'bigger' clubs because they are not considered good enough, show their real ability with other teams.

Fulham are not a side you want to be playing at the minute, Owen Coyle will tell you that.

I would be a very happy man if Pardew looked at Dempsey and held talks as to what he would hope to achieve at St.James' Park, and you never know, the American might like the idea of playing inÂ frontÂ of 50,000 people.

Of course if Pardew is feeling really generous, he might even pick up Moussa Dembele from them as well, both for Â£15m? ðŸ˜€

Dembele is a star in the making, in my opinion at least and we can expect big things from him next season, if he remains at Fulham that is.

Do you think Clint Dempsey would be a good addition to the squad, if we had the chance to sign him up?
