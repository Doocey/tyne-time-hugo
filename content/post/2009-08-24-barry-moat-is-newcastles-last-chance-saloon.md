### Ashley - Still in control

Mike Ashley is still in control of Newcastle United, 13 weeks after we suffered the dreaded drop to the Coca Cola Championship. The news today, is that the deadline has been extended for Barry Moat to complete  the takeover of the club but that news, carries both good and bad consequences. First of all it means we probably will not sign anyone this transfer window at all but the upside is, that Mike Ashley is very much willing to sell to Barry Moat and is trying his utmost to hand over the club to the local businessman. Unfortunately the CCC requires a good sized squad for the injuries that we will receive and knowing Newcastle, we'll get quite a few.

We need new players and there are plenty of players who want to join the club as well. The likes of Per Ciljan Skjelbred have already sounded out their desire to play for the Black and White of Newcastle, even in our worst circumstances. Robert Earnshaw was linked this weekend and I for one would be happy to avail of his services. He might be a journeyman but he still has a classy finish and the ability to muster up something that can change a game. What the price would be, is a different thing. Chris Hughton is doing a stellar job so far with the team and youth. Even Xisco is getting a fair run-out unlike under Kinnear's or Shearer's reign. Even after all of this, Chris said he just wants to remain a coach and we would like the same.

So, as another deadline is extended/expired, we still wait in faint hope that the Geordie, Barry Moat can save us from another season of Ashley's mismanagement and bring us back to the Premier League, where we belong. And if anyone has questioned our fans or the size of our club, have a look at our last home game, against Sheffield Wednesday. Higher attendance than Sunderland v Chelsea. Doesn't that tell you something? I needn't explain.
