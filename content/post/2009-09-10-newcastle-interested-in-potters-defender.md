###Â Cort - Good enough for Newcastle?
Stokes' Leon Cort is being linked with a move to Newcastle tonight after the CB has fallen short of the first team at the Britannia. Bobby Robson engineered a move for Carl Cort, the infamous striker that cost Newcastle United Â£7m and failed to produce but we think things might be different with Leon. Of course he'd arrive on loan for a month and we'd take  things from there but I suppose any back up or indeed players are only a plus at Newcastle. Our squad is far too small and especially in the Coca Cola Championship.

Cort is 6'3' and very capable of nodding a few in for us this season. Unfortunately we don't have much of a selection when it comes to loans but we'll muster up something, or so we hope.

Chris is meant to be working on a few players as the the takeover saga rumbles on and now Mike Ashley is centre to a fraud investigation about Sports Direct alongside JJB Sports. I'm sure you've bought a couple of things from both.

Anyway, it's rather saddening that we've lowered our expectations to the likes of Cort who wouldn't be heard mentioned in the same sentence as Newcastle United.

Although, it seems we are adjusting with life in the Championship, very well indeed, for now at least.
