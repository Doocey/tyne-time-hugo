### Hughton - Disappointed over missing out on Moses and rightly so

News is rife that Wigan Athletic has completed the signing of promising English talent Victor Moses from Crystal Palace for a fee of Â£2.5m. The Nigerian born was heavily linked with a move for Moses, however the Magpies were unwilling to match the administrators asking price of Â£2.5m which could turn out to be a great bargain in the future. Every Toon fan across the globe is  disappointed to be beaten by Wigan and Mike Ashley more than anyone we'd expect, especially when his enemy in Dave Whelan. What's worse for the Newcastle owner, is that BBC will be airing a 'Watchdog' like program, investigating Mike Ashley's factories in Laos that produce the ultra cheap Donnay and Lonsdale sportswear.

I for one would've loved to have seen Victor Moses pull on the Black & White of Newcastle United but it seems as if the idea of joining Wigan and using them as a stepping stone to bigger clubs and great things, have played a huge incentive in getting Moses to the DW Stadium.

The burning question now is whether we will see a striker arrive on Tyneside before the window closes. I always looked forward to the end of the transfer window in anticipation of getting one more signing and indeed to see the panic buys by often, newly promoted clubs.

However, it won't surprise me if nothing happens one our side of the fence, although we've done pretty well to keep the best players in our squad as well as adding a decent winger in Wayne Routledge to it.

Mike Williamson seems to be a very sturdy centre-back although it's far too early to tell, however, I'm confident he'll even nod a few goals in for Newcastle in the near future.

So what do you guys think? Will Chris Hughton venture into the transfer market before times runs out? Everyone knows we need a speedy striker.
