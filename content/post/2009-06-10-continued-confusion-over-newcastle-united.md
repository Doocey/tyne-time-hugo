Apparently yesterday Profitable Groupe were interested in buying Newcastle United Football Club. Earlier this morning Derek Llambias has rubbished these rumours and says there has been no  contact from this group. He said however, they were in talks with 4 potential buying groups , none of the names disclosed. It seemed a little too perfect what they were saying, making St.James' 60,000 seater, Alan Shearer as manager and run it as a similar mould as Barcelona where the fans have a major say. As much as Llambias has denied it, The Chronicle (local newspaper) has continued in their quest about 'serious' interest from the Far East.

A source told the Chronicle :

> “We’re working with Seymour Pierce and in discussions with the people that Mike Ashley has appointed to sell his club.
>
> “We don’t expect to be dealing with the managing director too much.”

Derek Llambias said :

> 'We know who this Profitable group are because we had some dealings with them last summer regarding some business in the Far East, but there has been no contact since.
>
> 'We have never spoken to the Profitable Group about the sale of Newcastle United since we put the club up for sale.
>
> 'They have claimed they have met Mike and myself to discuss things and they haven’t. There are three or four interested parties who we are talking to, but these aren’t one of them.'

Make of it what you will but no one really knows what's going on with Newcastle United.

Comments appreciated 🙂
