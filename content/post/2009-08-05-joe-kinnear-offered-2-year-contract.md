### Kinnear - Claims he's been offered job at Newcastle

Just when we thought we'd hear no more from him, Joe Kinnear has come out and claimed he has been offered his managerial spot back at Newcastle United. BBC News broke  this story and since it's been on Sky Sports News with David Craig up North-east has claimed that Joe Kinnear will **not** be returning as manager. This news comes as Keith Harris says the club should be sold by the end of August and we've no manager, and players leaving around us.

The hierarchy at Newcastle are denying it but who can we believe? Joe Kinnear or the lying board at Newcastle? I'll settle for David Craig. No offence Joe, but it's best you stay away from Newcastle, for your health and ours. More to follow.
