### Llambias - What can believe from this guy?

Another day passes and  another day missed for Newcastle United. Yesterday's game at St.James' Park for Sir Bobby Robson was a great scene and a very much deserved ovation for the legend that is Sir Bobby. England went on to win the game 3-2 courtesy of a Shearer penalty in which he earned the penalty too. Indeed any time Shearer did get the ball, it was met with a huge roar of excitement and Alan, was looking as sharp as ever. Bobby, watched from the heavens, putting to bed doubts that he would arrive at the game at all. It was a great even to honour a great man, who is battling cancer for the 5th time. A great fighter, player, manager and person.

It would have capped the night should new owners have been unveiled with Shearer appointed as head manager but I suppose besides the fact Mike Ashley would never think of it, we just simply haven't been taken over just yet. People are beginning to wonder whether Newcastle will be taken over at all and whether Mike Ashley will remain in charge, hoping for a Newcastle United promotion to rise the clubs value once again. We don't know if there are any bidders or if there are, what their identities are. It's been the same old with Ashley and co. for his tenure in charge, hopefully it'll come to an end, very very soon, like, this month.
