    Douglas - A wanted man with Fulham joining NUFC the race for his signature
  </p>
</div>

After yesterdays result away to Chelsea a lot of focus was on Alan Pardew's comments on Andy Carroll and the possibility of bringing him back to St.James' Park. Pardew commented that the matter was in the hands of the board and that although Carroll's return is unlikely, he would welcome him back with open arms. He's not alone either. However, I think we should be looking at acquiring a new centre-back before the window slams shut, just to make sure our squad is in the shape it should be - as an energy sapping season takes shape. It was great to see  Steven Taylor back in the last couple of games and alongside Coloccini, they are our first choice CB's, no doubt about that.

Do we want to risk Coloccini or Taylor in the early stages of Europe though? I hope not. Perch is more than competent in that area of the pitch, and ideally we'll add another defender to bolster the ranks to add to Curtis Good.

Douglas of FC Twente is the desired target, and NUFC have made it no secret that they'd like to sign him up. The supposed transfer has somewhat dragged on though, and in all fairness - it's all been a bit weird.

Douglas says he hasn't received any approaches from other clubs and that he wants to stay at Twente, while a member of their board said that both Fulham & Newcastle had been in touch regards his services.

Martin Jol clearly thinks that Douglas has all the attributes to make a top Premier League defender and is hoping to lure the Brazilian to Craven Cottage before too soon.

Alan Pardew has other ideas though, and wants to make Douglas a Magpies before the window closes. All easier said than done.

I have a feeling that if we miss out on the FC Twente CB, we might end up regretting it, and I'm of the opinion that one final push will be made to try sign him up.

Â£4.5m is the quoted fee, and it's a fair price for a defender who is highly rated by the NUFC scouting team, and even turns out a fine player on Football Manager 12. What are we waiting for? ðŸ˜€

All in all, I would be very surprised if one last attempt isn't made to sign him. I for one, would be a happy chap if we could manage it.

The window is coming to a close, and if we can keep all our players at the expense of no more signings then it'll have been a veryÂ successfulÂ window.

Comments welcome ðŸ™‚
