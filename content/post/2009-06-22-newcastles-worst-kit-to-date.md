###Â Kit - We'll be playing our first Championship game in it!

It seems that releasing our new kits and Coca Cola Championship badges for the jerseys are more important than announcing a manager or owners. Today Newcastle United released their new away kit and it's the  worst one I've seen in a long long time at Newcastle. Newcastle United are known for their unique and stylish designs each year and the new home jersey is very nice. However a yellow and white striped Newcastle jersey just doesn't go and has nothing resembling Newcastle United about it.

The only reason I'm guessing they used yellow was because the last time that Newcastle wore yellow in the league they gained promotion to the top flight. Here's a pic of that kit they used.

Kit - Not nearly as bad as the new one!

That was the year 1993 when Keegan stormed them back to the Premier League. Can Shearer storm them back to the top flight, alike? Well there's one lucky omen!
