Although we are known for signing rather under-performing wingers, reports are surfacing today that Chris is looking to trial former PSG live wire Fabrice Pancrete. Most of you saying who I'm sure. However, Pancrete has been around for some while now and has played in many of the main European leagues, except for The Premier League. Pancrete is a winger by trade and  although I must say I haven't seen him play, his reports are quite good. Saying that, if he was that good, surely he wouldn't be a free agent searching for a new club?

He's 6'1 and 29 years of age. He's played for Louhans-Cuiseaux, Guingamp, Le Mans, Paris Saint-Germain,Â  Real Betis (loan), Sochaux (loan) and had trials with Sheffield United. If you don't call him well travelled then I don't know what to call him!

Hughton is rumoured to be interested in signing him as we are indeed short of pace and wingers. However, as he is a free agent this could again signal that Mike Ashley doesn't intend on handing Chris some cash to spend in Jan, as we first thought.

Then again you what happens when you assume and you're wrong. Let's hope he does back Hughton, as it's seriously needed.

Would you like to see the French 'wizard' line out in St.James' Park?
