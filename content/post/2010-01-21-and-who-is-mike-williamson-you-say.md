### Williamson - Bid accepted

It seems Chris Hughton is moving fairly rapidly on transfers at the minute and for once it seems as if we could complete two transfers in the space of two days, for two defenders. The arrival of Danny Simpson was confirmed yesterday and Sky Sports revealed tonight that Mike Williamson will enter talks with Newcastle United following our bid was accepted for the 6'4 defender. Mike  Williamson arrived at Fratton Park for a initial fee of Â£2m, a transfer fee that could've rose to Â£5m if he had played a certain amount of games for the club. However, with Portsmouth financially strapped, they're pretty much eager to accept any bid, and it get rid of that clause on their part anyway.

A lot of fans never heard of this guy, but I must say I remember the day that Portsmouth signed him. I was watching the Transfer Deadline Day and waiting for news of Michael Johnson's possible move to Newcastle. The only thing I can remember besides Johnson failing to arrive was what seemed a huge fee for Portsmouth to pay for a Watford defender. He's 26 years of age.

Needless to say we haven't seen anything of him of late and he's looking for the exit door, as quick as possible. What we don't know is if the bid that's been accepted is a loan deal or includes a transfer fee. Most fans are saying it's highly unlikely that there's a fee involved in this transfer.
