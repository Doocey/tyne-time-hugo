#### Romeu - Being looked at by Chris alongside Nacim Boukhelifa

I know the transfer window is well and truly closed until January but Chris Hughton and his background staff are already looking at targets for when the action starts again in the New Year. In the last couple of days, Oriol Romeu and Nacim Boukhelifa have been linked with the club and according to reports, these two players have very bright futures indeed. Romeu who is 18 years -old plays for Barcelona as a defensive midfielder, whilst Nacim Boukhelifa, 19 year's old also plays in midfield, but is a free agent at the minute.

Indeed Nacim is on trial at Newcastle at the minute and the lads have a look at him, and see whether he's worth recruiting. Perhaps he'd help Hatem Ben Arfa settle in a little easier? The Frenchman (Boukhelifa) trialed with Manchester City earlier in the Summer but didn't make the cut it seems - still though, encouraging for the player himself to have clubs like City and United looking at him.

The only question I'm asking though, is why we're looking at another two midfielders? We already have Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Danny Guthrie, Dan Gosling and quite a few youngsters that would love to be given aÂ chanceÂ in the midfield position. If I'mÂ honest, we should really be looking atÂ recruitingÂ a left-back, maybe even a right back to bolster our defensive capabilities.

It's good to see we're looking at young players and ones for the future, but we need to allow our own youngsters some playing time too, as they're as good if not better than what we're looking at.

Anyway, time will tell whether these stories are go-ers' or not, but we can only wait and see.
