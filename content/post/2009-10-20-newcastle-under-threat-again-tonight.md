Scunthorpe is tonight the venue for Newcastle United's latest game on the road following last weeks loss to Nottingham Forest. The latest news to emerge from Newcastle is that Chris Hughton has been offered the full-time job verbally, with negotiations to start after the forthcoming games. Tonight will prove yet another stern test for a dicey Newcastle side of late. With news that  Steven Taylor will be out of action for a month, Danny Simpson may well continue his spell at CB or perhaps Tamas Kadar will get a chance, if available for selection.

There is no doubt that every team in the league wants to beat us and they'll try their utmost. As we saw at Blackpool and Nottingham teams just crave on playing high paid, much talked about footballers such as the Fabricio Coloccini's and the Kevin Nolan's.

As a fan, I'm not too confident about this affair but I think with an early goal to settle nerves then we might press on ad perhaps double our lead. However, Scunthorpe are in good scoring form themselves and with a bit of a leaky back-four then you just never know what'll happen.

Either way , we have to approach the game with the utmost importance. Nile ranger could start tonight instead of Marlon Harewood but we'll just have to see what Chris decides to do.

One thing is for sure, we need to score more goals than we concede.
