As the speculation mounts about Jermaine Beckford, alongside the price, I think it's worth taking a look at other players that Newcastle United should really consider making inquiries for. All the media hype has been about Matthew Kilgallon & Jermaine Beckford and I'm sure about 96% of my articles this new year are revolved around the Sheffield United centre half and the  Leeds United hitman. I'm sure there's many players out there vying for a move to Newcastle and below I've put together three players which I think would be worth a shot at St.James' Park.

1. Peter Whitthingham

I think it's fair to say that **Peter Whittingham**, although not a striker, is on red-hot form this season. Cardiff have had a mixed season so far but still linger in a healthy position. A lot of it comes down to Michael Chopra and this guy, Peter Whittingham. He's already racked up 15 goals in all competitions with 13 of them coming in the Coca Cola Championship. Not half bad if you ask me. We don't know what Cardiff would ask money-wise for him, if they would be forced into selling him that is. I think Â£4 - 5m would prise the 25 year old Â from The Bluebirds.

2. Billy Sharp

**Billy Sharp** is only 23 years of age but has already played for a whole host of clubs. From Sheffield to Scunthorpe and back to Sheffield again, this season, we can see why the Blades forked out Â£2m for him, only 2 years after letting him go for about Â£100,000. Sharp's netted 10 goals already this campaign for Doncaster and proven to the fans why Sheffield Utd did indeed pay millions for him. In a good run of form with Doncaster, I'm sure neither the Blades or Sharp could turn down a move to Newcastle United, the league leaders. Although a life long Sheffield fan, I'd fancy our chances of signing the 5'6 striker.

3. Nicky Maynard

**Nicky Maynard** needn't score a more spectacular goal than his effort against QPR a few weeks ago to secure interest from teams across the country. A wonderful goal to say the least and not a one hit wonder either. Maynard has bagged the same amount as Kevin Nolan (10) and to be honest, I think he'd be worth having a look at. He's only 23 and seems to have a lot left in him. I rate him in the same bracket as Jermaine Beckford and he's certainly one of the best strikers in the Coca Cola Championship at the minute, in a Bristol City side that's picking up form all the time.

So there's my three players that I think are worth a shot, and as good as Beckford to say the least. They've all scored double figures this season and I'd be confident they'd seriously consider an offer from Newcastle United. So Chris, if you're reading, do take notice because these are three talented lads and might not cost Â£3m either.
