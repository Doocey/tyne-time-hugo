#### Branson - Influx of shirt sponsorship money seemingly financed CissÃ© move

With Newcastle United managing the biggest, and most expensive coup of the January transfer window so far, many were surprised by the Â£9m spent on Senegalese striker Papiss Demba Cisse -Â includingÂ me. Of course you would be surprised though, after all Alan Pardew did say that they had no plans to bring in a striker this window - despite giving Jason Prior a trial on Tyneside .

However, to our delight Papiss Demba Cisse signed a 5Â½ year contract and took on the challenge of the coveted #9 shirt, a jersey last held by Andy Carroll - the striker we sold to Liverpool for almost 4 times what CissÃ© cost. Good business you'd have to say, even before he has kicked a ball.

Mike Ashley has had praise lavished upon him this week after the coup and rightly so, however, it is believed that the money which saw CissÃ© join Newcastle came from Virgin Money's sponsorship deal agreed with NUFC only weeks previous.

That isn't a bad thing though - indeed it's quite a frugal move from the Newcastle United hierarchy.

As unlikely as my headline may be, I would be surprised if it was proven false.

The two year deal agreed between Virgin Money sees Newcastle United pocket Â£20m - ten million pounds per annum with the first year paid on the 1st of January I'd expect.

CissÃ© arrived for about Â£9m - do the math yourselves.

With that said, it is smart thinking and an example of Newcastle United's newborn self-sufficiency under Ashley. Not to mention the quality of the actual player himself - a very talented lad from watching him in the Bundesliga both this season, and last year.

While many fear for the future of CissÃ©'s international teammate Demba Ba, I'd be quite confident we'll hang on to the striker.

Think about it, a good friend of yours from Senegal will be living, training, and playing alongside you, even after your stint at the AcoN. I wouldn't be looking to uproot and go anywhere any time soon - would you?

Of course we have to be realistic and prepare for allÂ possibilitiesÂ - but for some reason or another I don't think we'll lose anyone this transfer window. We need to strengthen our back four as soon as we can, with Carr and the backroom team working away on a new defender as we speak. As well as that, Coloccini must be given a new contract and have his future cemented on Tyneside at the earliest opportunity. The contract negotiations will soon resume, Alan Pardew confirmed today.

Regardless of who financed CissÃ©'s move to Newcastle United, he is now our new number nine - and with everything aside, it is hard not to be excited about the potential of both Ba and the new arrival.

Bright future ahead of NUFC? We hope so!
