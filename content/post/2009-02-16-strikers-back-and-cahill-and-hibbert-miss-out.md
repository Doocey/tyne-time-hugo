Good news today as Obafemi Martins, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith will all return for the Everton game as St.James' which promises to be a important battle to say the least. We need the win, Everton would like it too, but Everton's away form is not going to dent their confidence considering they have played, on occasions, a lot better on the road then at home.

The good news is, Martins with his rampant pace and Viduka with his odd goal here and there will come in handy as the Premier League's season finale approaches. We haven't overly strengthened our squad in January but the players we have bought, are up for the challenge and that alone is hear warming + they are quality players too. It will be a good game we hope with Newcastle triumphing at the end. What a win it would be, and for Blackburn Stoke and Sunderland to lose ðŸ˜€
