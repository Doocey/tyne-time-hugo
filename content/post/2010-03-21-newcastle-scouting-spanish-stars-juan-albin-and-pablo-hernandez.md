### Juan Albin - Newcastle reportedly interested in this guys services

I think it's fair to say that Newcastle United as a club haven't had a great number of good buys from Spain the last ten or so years. The likes of Albert Luque spring to mind, and that Â£9.75m price-tag too. Today, the Sunday papers are at again and are reporting that we're after Getafe's Juan Albin and indeed Valencia's promisingÂ Pablo Hernandez. Juan Albin is more of a  Robbie Keane sort player, especially internationally where he fills the pocket behind the two strikers. He's 23, a promising talent and more importantly out of contract in the summer.

As for Pablo Hernandez, he looks as if he'll be a Valencia player for a few years to come. He recently signed a contract till early 2014 with the Spanish club and if we were to get him I'd say the fee wouldn't be far off Albert Luque's!

After a 2-2 draw away to Bristol yesterday, it was good to see the lads fight back and clinch an important draw. As I predicted, it was going to be a very tough game and we needed to be wary of Nicky Maynard, you can now see why.

It was a very good come-back and it would've have been even sweeter should Leon Best's last gasp header not have been brilliantly saved by Bristol #1. His first goal for the club in coming closer and closer.

Besides that, West Brom & Forest both won making our away trip to Doncaster even more important and indeed our home affair with Nottingham Forest crucial as well, a game which Tyne Time will be attending to hopefully see a Toon win.

Pablo Hernandez & Juan Albin are good players and it's encouraging to see that we're being linked with them. What Chris Hughton's wage budget will be come the summer I don't know but I really hope that Mike Ashley, if he's still in charge, will give him a nice bit of cash because we need to spend if we want to make a good attempt of staying up.

I'm sorry about the lack of articles in the last few days too, it's because I'm very busy with school and indeed other tasks. It will continue that way until the end of June too, and by then I can hopefully be reporting on Newcastle's summer buys ðŸ˜€
