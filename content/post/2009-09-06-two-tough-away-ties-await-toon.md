###Â Chopra - In good form for Cardiff

Just because we are top of the table and outwitting the media, it doesn't mean we have the right to say we're going straight back up or that we can gain promotion at first attempt easily. It's not as simple as that, and although we have made pretty much a perfect start to our Championship campaign, our next two games will really test our resolve. Firstly we  travel to the Welsh capital Cardiff and then we'll venture down to the holidaying area, Blackpool. Former Toon striker Michael Chopra is banging in the goals for Cardiff at the minute and we're hoping that former teammate and current friend, Steven Taylor, can alter Chopra's goal scoring.

Cardiff will provide a perfect match for us and their home crowd will act as a 12th man. If we did manage to get a win from the game then it'd be a very very good three points. As you have probably saw this season already, Cardiff look very dangerous, with Michael Chopra and Ross McCormack leading the troops.

Then Blackpool awaits and this will be another test for the lads, more of a physical one then anything I may add. Blackpool have the ability to play football, although their one win in the league to date may argue otherwise. One thing they will threaten from, is set pieces and mainly corners. Irishman Wes Hoolahan will be one to watch out for.

Should we manage four or indeed six points in those affairs, and we do sign two or three more on loan, who knows what could happen and I haven't even mentioned the possibility of Alan Shearer yet ðŸ˜€
