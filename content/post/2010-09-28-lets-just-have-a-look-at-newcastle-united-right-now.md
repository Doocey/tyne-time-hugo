###Â Hughton - Delighted to be manager of Newcastle United FC

This day one year ago, we were preparing for the home visit of QPR at St.James' Park, and indeed looking to grab top spot of what when then called the Coca Cola Championship. We went on to draw that game 1-1, Marlon Harewood scoring his dÃ©but goal for the club, after Ben Watson had put Queens Park Rangers in line for a win. Add to that, confusion over the ownership of the  club, constant rumours of players leaving, and indeed many stories of potential new managers. One year on, we're 6th in the Barclay's Premier League, in the 4th Round of the Carling Cup after defeating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a thriller and are settled to say the least.

Yet, two defeats at home - against Blackpool, who can play football, and Stoke City, who are the poorest footballing team in the Premier League to say the least, have put a cloud over Chris Hughton & NUFC. I'm reading stories from all over, claiming 'shock defeats' and nonsense like that. We've come into the Premier League with one ambition - **to survive relegation**. Anything better than that is a bonus.

It'd been a great change from a year ago. We've a humble, no-nonsense manager, who bothers with everything worthwhile on the training pitch and can spot a very good player too. We've brought in James Perch, Dan Gosling, Sol Campbell, Cheick TiotÃ©, Hatem Ben Arfa & now it seems Yven Moyo has also joined the Newcastle ranks, despite interest from a little club called Manchester United. These all arrive, when realistically, a lot of people didn't expect anyone new to come through the door of St.James'.

Mike Ashley is going to stay as owner for the foreseeable future, but already, has increased the clubs value since promotion, putting it beyond the Â£100m asking price last year. it also looks as if we'll be strengthening in January if need be, with Hughton quietly confident that he'll get some financial backing.

Never mind this nonsense of disappointment of the season so far. We're exceeding expectations, and more importantly we need to see that we're heading in the right direction - recruiting promising youth, and adding some young flair to the side.

Our next trip is to the City of Manchester where we'll look to try an get something from the biggest money wasters **the richest club** in the Premier League. You never know what might happen, with other clubs having already gone and scraped points from Mancini's side.

Anyway, we can only wait and see. So far so good, indeed very good from Newcastle United & Chris Hughton. Long may it continue.
