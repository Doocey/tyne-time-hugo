### Harewood - Out injured again

Chris Hughton today denied the rumours that he is set to capture Marcel Seip from Plymouth Argyle. The defender, who was reported to have had a bust up with manager Paul Sturrock was rumoured to have been on his way to St.James' Park within the next couple of days but today Chris refuted those reports. However one man that he took no time in confirming his  interest in, was Marlon Harewood. The Aston Villa striker is out of favour with manager Martin O'Neill and it's understood that the former Celtic boss is willing to let him travel to Newcastle for the next couple of months.

But our bad luck strikes again and Marlon is unable to travel because he is unfit, which is quite appalling considering he is a professional footballer on a huge weekly wage. Saying that, I'd like to see him in a Toon shirt and judge how good he is, mainly because we need a striker and secondly because we wouldn't have paid much of a fee for him.

Hughton said :

> “I’m aware that the lad is injured.
>
> “The position we’re in, we are assessing where we are at the moment.
>
> “We’re looking at who we can bring in and who we are able to bring in.

Astonishingly enough, Hughton revealed that there was a little money available to him, to bring players in, as small as it may be. On the last day of the transfer window, we apparently had a bid of £1.75m for Craig Cathcart rejected by Manchester United, and when we readjusted to a loan move, Cathcart failed his medical.

What ever happens in the coming weeks, Hughton is very sure of some loan signings and I'd be pretty confident of a couple as well. However, Hughton said no one will arrive today.

> “We’ll go through what we think is right and go through the possibilities that we still have.
>
> “There won’t be anybody coming in today. No decisions have been made yet.”

Hughton is only looking to bring in the right players though and he's reiterated that again today.

> “There’s a period when we can bring players in. but we’re under no pressure.
>
> “Any players that we bring in must be the right players to bring into this squad.”

We trust Chris on this one as he's done a top job so far, bringing us top of the Championship. He's even nominated for manager of the month, which I'd expect him to get.

Comments welcome 🙂
