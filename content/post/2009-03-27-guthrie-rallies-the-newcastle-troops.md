###Â Guthrie - Very good player and an important one for us

Danny Guthrie has come out today and issued a rallying call to all his fellow troops at Newcastle, claiming that the players are to blame for the poor form. We have saw some terrible performances from this Newcastle side this season, with no fingers pointing at the defeat to Liverpool, although Liverpool were fantastic that day. We weren't good at Bolton or Blackburn and the list goes on and on however that was then and this is now. A good run in can fix it up and staying up is still possible although the tabloid papers would like to convince you otherwise.

I'm a big fan of Guthrie and think he was an excellent signing, he scored a very nice goal against Portsmouth too and has a lot more to offer to Newcastle United FC. He cost as little as Â£2.5m and will prove well worth it, as he already has. Chelsea are up next and they too are getting slowly buy surely back to their best under Guus Hiddink. They made a big slip up at Spurs to close the gap on United and it will be playing on their mind at St.James' Park. Why not make it 2 losses in a row, for Chelsea that is ðŸ˜›

So there it is, a 21 year old new signing from Liverpool issuing a call to players, to fight for the club save the mighty Newcastle United from relegation
