###Â Shepherd - Front runner for Newcastle takeover? - hopefully not

Surprisingly , the BBC have taken a time out from Wimbledon and have broken a story that I will lead to many. Apparently if all goes well, Newcastle will  be sold by then end of the month, but we're nearly there and there hasn't been any signs of a takeover happening. However now, as we already know Shepherd is interested and is as reported leading the race with a Â£60m bid, which is expected to be accepted by Mike Ashley. Ironically in Christmas he was looking for Â£250m for the club. That's a drop of Â£150m in asking should Ashley have his demands met!

There isn't much in the way of news but soon there will be stories out. You can expect other consortium's (if any) declaring their interest and lets hope one of them is The Profitable Group. They seem to know how to run a football club and what's it requires. Let's hope though, most importantly the club is sold by the end of the month.
