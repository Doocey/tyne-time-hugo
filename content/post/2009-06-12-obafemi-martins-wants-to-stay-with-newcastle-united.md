###Â Martins - Doesn't want to be sold!

What a great way to start the weekend! Obafemi martins, the little Nigerian who cost the club Â£10m and is a major fans favorite has declared, officially that he is looking to  stay with Newcastle United and lead the promotion challenge that will come in the following months. Speaking to Evening Chronicle he today confirmed that he doesn't want to be placed on the transfer market but understands if NUFC have no other choice but to place a for sale tag on the top of his head.

Martins said :

> 'I hope I am not sold,'
>
> 'If the club decides to sell me I have no choice but to go. But my aim is to stay and help get Newcastle promoted next season.
>
> 'I love living in Newcastle and there are few better places to live and play.
>
> 'I know the club is for sale and that is hard for the fans. Yet I hear there could be some light at the end of the tunnel eventually.'

He says his decision to stay cam about after talking to some people about Juventus's relegation in 2006 and how they kept their key players and popped straight back up

> 'I have been in Italy for treatment lately.
>
> 'There I spoke to a lot of people about Juventus and their demotion to Serie B (in 2006).
>
> 'Back then, they still kept very, very good players such as Pavel Nedved, Alessandro Del Piero and Gianluigi Buffon. That helped them get promoted, so I can take a lot of solace from that.'

For me at least, this is great news and should he stay which he wants to, then surely he'll great in the Championship?
