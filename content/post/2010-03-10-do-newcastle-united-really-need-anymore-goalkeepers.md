There are reports emerging that Chris Hughton was in Scotland yesterday to watch John Ruddy play and keep tabs on the youngsters progress. The 23 year-old which is quite young for a keeper is on loan at Motherwell from Everton, with the hope he can finally over-take Time Howard between the sticks. If that's hard enough, it's a very long shot that he'll outdo either the  long-serving Steve Harper or indeed Time Krul and that's before I even mention Fraser Forster.

Apparently Hughton was watching Ruddy play but for all we know, it mightn't have been him at all. If you ask me, there's no need for any more goal-keepers on Tyneside now. The concern I have is that we might actually lost Tim Krul if Steve Harper can continue for another 3 years, and it looks as if he'll have no problem in doing so.

More than a year ago, one of Newcastle's longest serving keepers in Shay Given departed what was a beleaguered club and is now enjoying life at Manchester City even though they've already changed managers twice. We didn't mind Given leaving on but scorned at the poor management on our part (the boards) in letting him go. For a mere fee of just over Â£6m too.

Maybe you guys think otherwise but a new keeper would be last on my list. There's rumours floating about today as well that we've Jamie O'Hara lined if we manage promotion to the Premier League. However, local rivals Sunderland are also interested in the Pompey man but I'd actually have confidence that he'd choose us rather than Steve Bruce's side. Just a gut feeling even though any neutral would call me the 'usual Newcastle United fan' for saying that.

Anyway, what do you guys think? John Ruddy or Jamie O'Hara as first signing? I think I know who I'd go for!
