### Perch - A more than decent defender who Forest want to keep

The breaking news is, as I'm sure you've heard is that we've finally managed to sign someone, and in the shape of Danny Simpson. The Manchester United former joins for a reported fee of Â£500k and on Â£10,000 a week wages, which if true, is very very good value. On top of that, if the wage figure that's being thrown about the place is accurate then I wonder what all the  confusion was about? Reports earlier suggested that he was demanding Â£30,000 p/w which is surely untrue. It's good to see we've managed to sign Danny as he's a good lad and fits the bill for Newcastle ðŸ™‚

Now that our first signing has arrived we do really want and need more. Oyr bid for James Perch was rejected by Billy Davies and described as 'derisory'. The bid, according to sources was only Â£1m. Perch is highly rated with The Forest fans and indeed Colin Calderwood, and it's clear that Billy Davies doesn't want to sell.

He said :

> _'We must be doing something right if other teams in our division want our players,'_
>
> _'But we are looking to build a squad at the City Ground rather than dismantle one and James is not leaving. '_

Yet, even after the bid being rejected the Chronicle are suggesting that an improved bid could well surface as Chris Hughton & Calderwood are keen to bolster their thread-bare squad.

In what's been a fairly busy day for once on Tyneside albeit rumours, Scunthorpe's Michael O'Connor has too been lined with a whole host of clubs including ourselves which is encouraging to see.

Hopefully tomorrow will bring another signing or two, however unlikely that is!

Comments welcome ðŸ™‚
