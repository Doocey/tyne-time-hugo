### Colo - Scored today in a very big Newcastle United victory at Vicarage Road

Three points and a job done. It's nice to get back to winning ways away from home and thankfully the lads did indeed get their first three points outside St.James' Park since our victory at the Ricoh Arena those months ago. With West Brom winning at home to Derby County and Nottingham Forest suffering defeat to rivals Leicester City, it now means that we're 6 points clear  at the top of the table. We seem to be picking up form at the correct time of the season and you can't help but be pleased with Chris Hughton and the lads so far.

On top of the vicoty, we here at Tyne Time tipped Andy Carroll to be prevalent at Vicarage Road and to get on the scoresheet. Indeed he did repay our faith and it was also nice to see Fabricio Coloccini nab a goal, his last coming away to Cardiff City in a 1-0 win.
  
It's not looking half bad in fairness and if we can keep winning our away games then I'm certain we'll be all right. It's a matter of concentration and keeping injury free. Our next game sees us at home to Barnsley who we drew with earlier this season away from home 2-2. Barnsley got back to winning ways thanks to an Iain Hume goal and they too won't be any push-overs.

Hopefully Fabricio Coloccini can keep chipping in with important away goals because we will indeed need them. On another note, it's still remains to be seen whether Patrick van Aanholt will stay on Tyneside but we#re hopeful he does. If he does go back to Stamford Bridge then he's left with a job done.

Howay The Lads and lets hope we can keep our form!
