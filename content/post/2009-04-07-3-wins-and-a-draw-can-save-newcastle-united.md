### Dowie and Shearer - Can guide the Toon to safety

It will take 3 wins and a draw for Newcastle United to remain a Premier League team this season. We have had some shocking displays this season, like at Liverpool and Bolton. We have missed out on points that were there for the taking too. Like throwing our 2-0 deficit away against Stoke, and conceding a late late equaliser against Wigan. There have been other games that we could have taken all three points, including the Tyne Wear derby in St.James' or Everton at home but we need to forget these, we are now entering territory that NUFC haven't been in for a long long time. Hopefully it will be the last time too with us staying up.

Shearer and Dowie are the new men in charge, it was a smooth transition which is good to see. Stoke City are our next opponents and as I've said all week, or all season, it's a must win game for us. Good news is that last night I reported on Danny Guthrie getting injured, well it seems he'll be ok for the game at the Britannia, which is good news indeed. So here are my three wins and a draw, perhaps I am a little optimistic. Portsmouth - Win, Middlesbrough - Win, Fulham - Win/Draw and either a win/ draw at Stoke. Bare in mind we could also get something from the Spurs game too, or even Villa. One thing is for sure, we needs wins and not excuses.
