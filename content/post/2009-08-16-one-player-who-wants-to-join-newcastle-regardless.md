### Skjelbred - Still open to Toon switch

In what was a relieving victory for all sides yesterday, we were also reminded of the significant strengthening we need to maintain our good form. One man who's been linked with us for a long long time now is Per Ciljan Skjelbred. He's a  Newcastle United fan all his life and on many occasions now has said he's more than open to a switch to St.James' Park, conveniently commenting that, after our three nil victory against Reading. He's be a very good signing and someone who would fight for the club. He broke both his legs in one match in the Champions League for Rosenborg against Olympiakos so he's certainly no stranger to the roughness, and there'll be a lot of this in the Coca Cola Championship for sure.

Per said :

> “It started when I was eight or nine years old,”
>
> “Newcastle had a dream team with stars such as Ferdinand and Ginola.
>
> “I was there on holiday with my family, and ran onto the pitch, but was quickly chased off it.
>
> “I’ve been a Newcastle supporter since, seen all the matches I can, and love Newcastle greatly, second to Rosenborg.

So he certainly has a soft spot for Newcastle and just to make things a little bit clearer he said :

> “If I get the chance to play for Newcastle, I’ve had a perfect career.”

He also commented on other players and which ones he likes, and it seems he's well up to date on who's hot and who's not on Tyneside.

> “Michael Owen is no longer a favourite of mine. Otherwise I have to mention (Les) Ferdinand, he was much of the reason I became a supporter.
>
> “Today, Jonas (Gutierrez) is my favourite. He should play more.”

So there you have it, if we can get a good 5 or 6 players in the door and Shearer as manager then there's still hope of us bouncing back at first attempt, but there's a long long road ahead of us yet.

Comments welcome 🙂
