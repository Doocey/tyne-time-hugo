![Shearer - May not become Newcastle manager afterall](http://www.nufcblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/alan-shearer-3527780591.jpg)

News has broke that Mike Ashley has officially put Newcastle United up for sale and is looking for Keith Harris to broker a deal, quicker rather than later. News comes , as I reported in a couple or articles below that Ashley was in talks over a take over and now he has said himself that he's looking to cut his massive losses and get out of Toon. Speaking today, Ashley said 

Ashley said :

> “It has been catastrophic for everybody. I’ve lost my money and I’ve made terrible decisions. Now I want to sell it as soon as I can . . . advisers will be appointed shortly.”
>
> “Of course I regret it. I never said I was an expert in football clubs. I was just a fan – although a very wealthy fan. But I’m not so wealthy now.”
>
> “I put my money into it and I tried my best. But I accept my best was woefully short. I am genuinely sorry for everybody about what has happened.”

Who to buy Newcastle? Rumors of Newcastle going into administration if nothing is sorted quickly are floating about. If this was to happen. It would be the end of NUFC. More to follow.

Comments appreciated 🙂
