### Hughton - Expected to be announced soon

It seems as if Chris Hughton will be the new Newcastle United manager, within the next few days. It comes as no surprise really but I'm sure there's people out there who don't like seeing Chris take full control. A huge amount of credit is due to Chris as he's really brought Newcastle to it's feet, on the field anyway and it seems as if he's running a good system throughout the club. Of course  we're not really sure whether he is managerial material but there's only one way to find out, and that's by giving him the job on a full-time basis.

We expect Chris to accept the job but the rumoured figures are a little surprising. There is reports today that Chris will earn Â£5,000 a week, which is quite a decent amount. However, considering the likes of Joey Barton, Alan Smith and even Geremi are on **11** times that, it does really make you wonder.

Alan Shearer today pushed his name out there in one final hope that he might get a call but it seems a very long shot that Mike Ashley will offer the job to him. As the takeover has taken another apparent twist it's really unknown, what's going on.

The players certainly want Chris and I'd like to see him given the chance, but I wouldn't expect him to sign a yearly contract, maybe just one till January or the end of the season. If he manages to get us promoted then we can fault the guy at all can we?
