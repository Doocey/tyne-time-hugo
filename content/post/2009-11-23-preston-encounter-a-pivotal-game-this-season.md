#### Chris Hughton - Newcastle United Manager

Live on Sky Sports tonight is the meeting of Preston North End and Newcastle United, as if you didn't already know. Chris Hughton and the lads will attempt to reclaim top spot and in order to do that, they'll need to crack the tough challenge of Preston, in Deepdale. Although Preston lie in 12th position they've won 3 at home and 3 on the trot. Predictably, they're as tough at home as  they are away. Saying that, our away record isn't anything to be ashamed of, only losing out to Scunthorpe and Nottingham Forest and Blackpool on our travels & the majority of those teams are in quite decent positions in the Coca Cola Championship table.

Ahead of this game, we're expected to have much the same team we put out at home to Peterborough. Jonas is expected back fit but 'Zurab The Lad' is still suspended, following his sending off at home to Doncaster.

Expected line out:

Harper, Simpson, Taylor, Coloccini, Enrique, Taylor,Â  Butt,Â  Smith, Jonas,Nolan,Carroll

or at least that's what I think might line out tonight in what's sure to be a feisty encounter.

It'll be similar to the Sheffield game with Preston throwing everything at us for the ninety mins but all the same, with Argentine international in the side and England U-21 international set to play up front, surely we'll have a few goals is us? ðŸ˜€
