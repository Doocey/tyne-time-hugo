### Nolan - set for return for Arsenal game

Kevin Nolan is set for a return to the Newcastle side following his 3 match suspension. Nolan who got deservedly sent off after nearly breaking Victor Anichebe's leg returns and says that his frustration will come out on Arsenal, let's hope he doesn't mean physically! A reckless challenge from Kevin saw him receive a straight red and he has been missed in midfield in games such as United and Hull where he would have come in handy. Nolan who signed for Â£4m in January from Bolton is looking to feature in our relegation battle and I don't think we could have got a better player to stand up to the plate. Although we haven't had Nolan in midfield we've had Geremi, Butt and Smith who have all done quite a good job but not good enough to keep their place in the Toon team I should think.

We have 9 games remaining with 5 at St.James' and the other 4 on the road. Out of the home games we can certainly get points from Fulham and Middlesbrough if not against Arsenal and Chelsea. It's been a very tough season for us this year and we are probably the most unstable club in the Premier League at least for this year anyway.Hopefully, providing we stay in the Premier League we can put all of it behind us and build for the 09/10 season. We already have good youth players coming through and Jonas will tell you that too as he watched them against Everton, a game which they won too with Nile Ranger netting the winner yet again. Arsenal are up next, let's get an important win lads! For us , the fans!
