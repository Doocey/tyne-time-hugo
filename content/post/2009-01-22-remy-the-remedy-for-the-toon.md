When other teams are completing signings for the rest of the season Newcastle are trying to make some progress of their own, with LoÃ¯c Remy supposedly in talks with Newcastle United. Remy who can either play on the wing or upfront is with Nice at the minute and his scoring success hasn't gone unnoticed to Dennis Wise and Joe Kinnear. An initial bid of Â£3m was rejected but talks are on going as the fee could end up at Â£5m I for one would love to see Remy come to Newcastle as he is a very good forward, conveniently labelled the next Thierry Henry mind you ðŸ˜‰

Other reports are suggesting Donadel the Fiorentina defender could be the possible Italian loan signing but that all remains to be seen, there isn't too much time left and we need to get a move on to get anyone in before the window closes. With a bare squad like we have it is very important for us to bolster our squad and we hope that the lads do, very quickly indeed
