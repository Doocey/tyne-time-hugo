### Fans - Maybe, just maybe the nightmare is nearly over

Speaking to the Chronicle today, Derek Llambias confirmed that there has been 'two or more' bids for Newcastle United and that makes for very interesting reading indeed. It was reported earlier that the sale might take another 4 weeks, which it could well but since there has been bids received surely it can't take 4 weeks to complete the sale of the club? Then again it's Mike Ashley so you never know.

Llambias said :

> “There have been more than two bids at £100m.
>
> “At the moment we are in the hands of lawyers and it is all ongoing.
>
> “We are giving interested parties all the help that they need.”

So it's true prospective buyers were given a tour of St.James' Park and we hope, that the deal is concluded soon. Who are the interested parties though?!

Comments welcome 🙂
