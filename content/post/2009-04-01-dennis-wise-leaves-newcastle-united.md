### Wise - Leaving Newcastle can only be a good thing?

In a somewhat bizarre turn of events with Newcastle Wise is the latest to leave his seat at Newcastle. Today it was confirmed that Alan Shearer would be taking over for the remaining 8 games of the season in the hope of keeping us afloat in the Premier League. In my opinion we couldn't have got a better man who knows the club, the history the fans and most importantly the game inside out. Agreed there is nothing to suggest that Shearer will wave magic wand and save NUFC but I think as well as most other Toon fans, he'll do a lot better job than Chris Hughton - Thanks for the effort Chris.

It's been a fairytale week for the old Newcastle fans and the 'Cockney Mafia' haters with Wise leaving his post. Apparently he's leaving over the Lovenkrands signing and if that's true, what a spoilt little man he is. So there is is, Shearer as manager. It's been a long time coming and it's a pity he's to step into such a mess and try eek out results. However one thing is for sure, we as fans are delighted with this appointment and resignation but most importantly there is some stability back at Newcastle United now.
