According to Chilean newspaper _El Mercurio_, Newcastle United have reached an agreement with Juventus over their Chilean full-back, Mauricio Isla. For many of you that watched the 2014 World Cup in-depth, you will have recognised his name, and more than likely, will know him from his endeavours with the Italian champions. The news breaks from a Chilean paper in a report which they claim Newcastle have agreed a $14m fee (£8m) for the 26 year-old and barring something spectacular, he will sign the dotted line on Tyneside in the coming days. The news comes out of nowhere in fairness, and I am not sure how reliable that particular media outlet is, however, we do know that Newcastle were keeping tabs on him, before they eventually completed a deal for Mathieu Debuchy's replacement, Daryl Janmaat.

The news of his transfer is noted on the front page of [_El Mercurio_](http://impresa.elmercurio.com/pages/LUNHomepage.aspx?BodyID=1&dtB=22-07-2014 "isla newcastle") which would suggest that it is not only an exclusive, but something which they are confident is going to happen.

Personally, I find it a little hard to believe considering we recruited Janmaat, but perhaps, just maybe, Isla is a long-term replacement for Moussa Sissoko who has often featured on the right hand side for the Magpies.

If we do carry out this signing I think it's a big one for the club as it marks another deal which is close to the £10m mark - slowly but surely we beginning to spend some of the cash that has been gathering dust for the past three years.

We need a striker and perhaps a centre-back, but a right-sided player? That would suggest a potential departure, but maybe I'm being a bit too cynical. Time will tell.

What do you make of this news emerging from South America?
