Alan Shearer has come out today and talked about our chances against Stoke this weekend. After a pretty lacklustre performance against Chelsea last week Shearer knows, the players know and we know that 3 points is essential against The Potters on Saturday. Stoke themselves are in a little trouble of their own but in a more comfortable position than we are, although they don't really deserve to be where they are, they have fought like lions and Rory Delap has lead them to where they are now. I think all fans would swap places with Stoke right now.

Shearer said :

_'We have to try and create more chances for them. We have got two very good goalscorers._

_'It was always going to be difficult against Chelsea because of who we were up against._

_'We sacrificed Michael a little bit in trying to help us out in midfield because of the power that they had and he did that very, very well._

_'But in doing that we weren't able to get him into the right areas and, when he did, either the delivery let us down or there weren't enough people in there._

_'But that is something for us to work on.'_

He also hinted at using a more attacking side against Stoke and it would be the right thing to do. We can either win or lose this one. A draw wouldn't be substantial and we all know that.
