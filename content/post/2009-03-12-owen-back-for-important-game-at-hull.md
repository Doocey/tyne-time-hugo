### Owen - Need his goals and fast

Good news today that Michael Owen is back for the vital clash against Hull. It's a major boost as we've been lacking in goals. The Hull game is absolutely vital and a win is very necessary or we're into deeper trouble. A draw would be next to useless for us to be totally honest. Nicky Butt has come out and said it himself that a win is crucial and to be honest we've had plenty of time for preparation which is good.

We need the win and with Owen back we could get it ðŸ˜€ I'm confident and optimistic per usual and think that Â Hull and Arsenal are there for the taking. Heroes need to stand up and get stuck in, going down is not an option, for the player or for us, Newcastle fans, inevitably the best set of fans in the world. Come on lads! Get all 3 points!
