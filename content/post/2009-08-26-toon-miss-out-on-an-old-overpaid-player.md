### Campbell - Getting £10m over 5 years

Some may have been disappointed to have seen Sol Campbell go to Notts County and most of us thought that he could do a job for us. Luckily the only job he would've done is plunder us into serious financial difficulty with his huge wage demands. Notts County completed the  signing of the veteran centre back today, and the former Arsenal and Portsmouth player will bank £2m a year, on a 5-year contract. Meaning, at his time with the Magpies, he will have earned (appropriate word?) £10m from the League Two club. As Ed Harrison said on NUFC BLOG Notts County are the Manchester City of the lower divisions and Sol Campbell's signing could signal the first of many new, highly paid arrivals.

It's just as well we missed out on Sol because he's only there for one thing by the looks of it and it isn't to play League 2 football, that's for sure. The Magpies were taken over by rich foreigners not too long ago, a headline that was mistaken by many Newcastle United fans across the globe, including myself.

Luckily for us, our relegation from the Premier League will bring an end to the highly paid, overrated, journeymen that we always seemed to buy under the ownership of Freddy Shepherd and Mike Ashley. However, probably the best ever thing to come from Mike Ashley's regime at Newcastle United has been the youth setup which has already produced some rising talents.

That's all well and good, but since Dennis Wise and Vetere are now no longer with the club who is running the search for the new young blood? We know Richard Money is doing a great job with them but we need someone to keep bringing them in. However, somehow I don't think that it's top of Mike Ashley to-do list at the minute.

Comments welcome.
