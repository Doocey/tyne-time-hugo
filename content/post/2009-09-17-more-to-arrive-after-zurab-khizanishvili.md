### Khizanishvili - More than a decent signing

Firstly I'd like to apologise to you for the site being down the last two days. There was a problem with the server but all things are fixed now and the articles will begin to flow again. Anyway, the good news is, is that Newcastle United have completed the signing of Zurab Khizanishvili from Blackburn Rovers on a three-month loan deal. The Georgian is the first to arrive but is expected to Â the be the first of more to come. Reports are already suggesting James Vaughan could be very close to a loan move to St.James' Park.

Zurab is an all round defender and a very good one at that. He's certainly Premier League quality and why Sam Allardyce has opted to let the 6'2' Georgian leave we don't really know. Khizanishvili was a usual starter for Blackburn up until recently, he mustn't fit into Sam's luxurious football.

It's a very good signing from Chris Hughton and his third so far, with Danny Simpson, Peter Lovenkrands and now Zurab. That's more than Kevin Keegan ever signed on his own. We've needed cover for the defensive position and today we got it, in the form of an experienced centre half.

After yesterdays defeat to Blackpool, it was a timely reminder of what the Coca Cola Championship brings, and we can expect even tougher ties than the Seaside one last night.
