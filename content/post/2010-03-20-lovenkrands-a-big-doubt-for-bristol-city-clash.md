###Â Lovenkrands - Ankle injury could force the Dane out of Ashton Gate clash

The free-scoring Peter Lovenkrands is 50-50 to make Newcastle's away trip to Bristol tomorrow after suffering a light ankle injury in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Scunthorpe. The Dane who has been banging them in up-front alongside Andy Carroll has hit 11 goals in his last 12 appearances, a record any striker would be proud of. However, the Dane is also a doubt for tomorrows clash  against Bristol City which will prove a very tough task too, especially at Ashton Gate.

The likes of Nicky Maynard, Chris Iwelumo have the ability to cause problems to any defence as they did to West Brom's, the day they beat them and helped us to a little gap.

A lot of people are expecting an easy ride away to Bristol tomorrow but I can guarantee you it'll be far from easy. Bristol themselves are struggling at the minute and have on and off days, there's no better place to have an 'on' day either then at home to the league leaders, Newcastle.

All the game from now until the end of the season are must win to guarantee us winning the title. Two bad games and the title race is right open again but I'd be fairly confident there won't be 2 slip-ups never mind one!

Tomorrows game is one of two tough away ties, the next at the Keepmoat away to Doncaster who can fairly play football at home. That's a matter for another day though.

There'll be late fitness checks for Lovenkrands but somehow I think Leon Best could partner Andy Carroll upfront 3pm tomorrow and hopefully, score his first goal for the club!
