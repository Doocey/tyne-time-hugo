#### Douglas - Didn't make the move to NUFC in January for various reasons

When you compare the January transfer window of 2012 to a year previous, it makes for surprising reading. Newcastle United lost Andy Carroll to Liverpool for the guts of forty million pounds, while on that same day managed to bring Stephen Ireland in on loan.Â It wasn't the happiest of times for Toon fans but this year however, couldn't have been more of a contrast. We happened to end up the highest  spenders on one individual player, after luring Papiss Demba CissÃ© to St.James' Park for Â£9m, and also held on to our best performers this season - in the shape of Demba Ba, Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik TiotÃ©. Unfortunately, despite efforts before midnight, we didn't manage to sign a defender to act as cover. Main target Adrian Mariappa was desperate to join NUFC, but Watford wouldn't balk to our final bid -Â believedÂ to have been very close to Â£2m.

The recruitment team did not panic and weren't forced into a deal that they did not anticipate - while at the same time working hard behind the scenes asking about various other targets.

With Mariappa failing to make the move, Alan Pardew and his team are very much expected to concentrate their summer efforts on bringing inÂ Douglas Franco Teixeira of FC Twente.

Graham Carr picked 24 year-old Douglas as the preferred target when combining his list of defenders andÂ inquiriesÂ were made for the Brazilian, only to have them rebuffed by Steve McClaren and co.

However, the 6'4 ft defender is out of contract in the summer, and Newcastle United are ready to pounce when the window opens for business.

Of course Steven Taylor will be close to fitness in the summer after his disappointing injury, but NUFC are still expected to go all out for Douglas and try sign him up as soon as possible. What is even more encouraging is the fact the 24 year-old is eager to play in the Premier League, and St.James' Park would be an ideal place for him to ply his trade.

If we can manage this guy on a freeÂ transfer and conduct our business quickly like we did in the summer, and of course this New Year then you'd have to pat Carr on the back again - even though I can't say I've seen enough of Douglas to rate him as highly as Taylor, Coloccini or even Williamson. Either way, a free transfer for a young, towering centre-back is well worth a punt and if things do not work out, I'm sure we could move him on for a million or two. Although, somehow I get the feeling he could fit in quite well on Tyneside.

Only time will tell of course, but the future does look bright for Newcastle United at the minute - finally!

The lads take on Aston Villa on Sunday hoping to keep the European dream alive and the return of former Newcastle United servants Shay Given, Charles N'Zogbia and even Stephen Ireland should contribute towards an exciting atmosphere at St.James' Park.

I reckon we can grab all three points and if you are of the same opinion then why not put a few pound on the lads?

Ba to score at any stage, and Newcastle United to win 2-0 is 15/1 Â - anyone?
