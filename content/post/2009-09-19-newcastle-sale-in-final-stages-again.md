### Ashley - Agreed fee with unnamed group

We haven't heard much on the Newcastle United sale lately but today brings news that a fee has been agreed with a buyer. The club issued an official statement to the 'Journal' saying that the £100m had been met but the overdraft was still a stumbling block as well as the Kevin Keegan scenario. Although Barry Moat is being strongly linked with the role, and it's more than  likely he is the man involved, there are reported to be two other bidders interested in the club, but yet to make an official bid.

The club said :

> _“The £100m asking price has been matched, however, we are still in negotiations and all parties involved are at sale and purchase stage.”_

This basically indicates to us that the sale is as good completed and the transaction plus the Keegan case has just yet to bet settled. If it's Barry Moat, we have to question his finances because it seems he's already taken so long to raise the cash for the club.

Saying that, we think he'll be a very good owner and he could rescue Newcastle United Football Club. He can't be any worse than Ashley, that's for sure, but we do know that he will appoint Alan Shearer should his takeover happen.

Newcastle are at home to Plymouth in our first 3pm kick-off in some time and hopefully we'll wrap up another three points at St.James' Park. We expect nothing short of 40,000 attending and it could well happen that Mike Ashley and Barry Moat will be present at the game.

We'll just have to see, and hopefully we'll see Newcastle United returning to the top of the table.

Comments welcome 🙂
