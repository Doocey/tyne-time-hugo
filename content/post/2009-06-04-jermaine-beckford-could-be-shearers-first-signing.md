###Â Beckford - Leaving Elland Road regardless

Reports over the last few days have suggested that Jermaine Beckford could arrive to St.James' as Shearer's first signing. Beckford who plays for Leeds is a center forward, for those of you who don't know. He's a powerful, tall and quite fast and his intentions are to  leave Leeds United this summer. Joining Newcastle would be a big move up for the lad and we can't see him resisting a all from the Magpies. With Oba Martins set to leave and Owen close after him we need another striker to partner Carroll, Ameobi or indeed Lovenkrands. Of course Nile Ranger will be pushing for a starting place too.

Shearer has already indicated that he has players lined up and they are willing to come, all he needs is the ownership sorted and himself as manager. We don't have an idea who they may be but I suspect Jermaine is one of them. We will be buying from other Championship teams more than likely as we are the biggest club in that division now. Players like Joe Mattock, Jordi Gomez, Kyle Naughton would be ideal for Newcastle's hopeful Premier League return. First we need the owners sorted, then manager and then Shearer can get to work on his transfer targets.
