## Ashley - Invest or see Newcastle face a very scary finale

With literally days remaining, the transfer window for Newcastle United has been nothing short of a disaster, so far anyways. Ebondo is still in the works after Toulouse upped their price for him, how long does it take for a deal to be completed at the Toon?! Look at City, ok they have many millions more but it didn't take long to sort to de Jong deal, and Ebondo has already said playing for Newcastle would be a 'dream'. Certainly what we like to hear but the move needs to be completed very soon. On other fronts Given is gone or as good as and Wigan have made a Â£6m bid for N'Zogbia, most Toon fans seem keen to accept this it seems.

Mike Ashley has put his full forces behind getting Miguel Veloso supposedly but even that capture, which would be brilliant, will not solve our problems. We need covers at fullback positions and indeed a powerful defensive minded, athletic midfielder, Veloso or M'Bia fit the bill. Rumours have been circulating around Newcastle, and now have Joey Barton and Michael Owen ruled out for a very long time. Two of our best players in the situation we are in. Mike, open that wallet of yours, Â£20m would be sufficient for this season. Can we really see Joe Â Kinnear and the recruitment team bringing in more than Albin Ebondo providing he moves?
