What a name, what a name. Ricky van Wolfswinkel has today been linked with a move to Newcastle United just before the window slams shut for this summer. The Daily Mail have an article about it, but there's discussion in volumesÂ throughoutÂ Dutch forums about his proposed move to Newcastle and it seems as if the Utrecht fans expect him to leave for St.James' in  the next day or so. The only time I've seen this guy play is when he destroyed Celtic with a hat-trick and I was very impressed by his finishing and overall play.

However, these are rumours and they'll come in their droves in the next couple of days. Robbie Keane is still on our radar according to sources and he is the likely candidate to wear the Black & white of Newcastle United this summer on loan.

If we did manage to sign Ricky van Wolfswinkel then it'd be a coup, in fact, another coup after we managed to get Hatem Ben Arfa. I don't know a shed-load on this player or what he's about, but any Utrecht or Dutch fans are welcome to give us an insight on the forward.

The 22 year-old was linked with a Â£7m move to Liverpool not too long ago which I vaguely remember so what we'd have to cough up is really questionable. That's what makes this rumour exactly that.

Either way, it's news, and we here at Tyne Time have promised to keep you updated with the latest happenings all Newcastle United. For quick messaged updates, please follow our twitter @TyneTime or [http://www.twitter.com/tynetime](https://twitter.com/tynetime).
