### Home Shirt - Nothing on the older Adidas designs if I may say so myself

After long deliberation the home kit of our beloved Newcastle United has finally been released and it has been met with mixed reaction. Some love it, others hate it and I myself, wouldn't be the biggest fan of our new home jersey. The normal Black and White stripes as you'd expect, with Northern Rock still there but the Puma logo in the centre of the body, like the Adidas one too.  However, it looks disproportionate with a big gap on the left side of the jersey. If they have placed the Puma logo across from the Newcastle badge then it would've looked much better,but these are the highly paid 'designers' for you.

Our away jersey and third kit are probably the better versions of these poor attempts from Puma, and they aren't a stitch on some of Adidas's previous designs for the Toon. The jersey will be the least of our worries though this summer as we face a tough season in the Premier League.

We're sure a certain percentage of you Geordies will come out and buy the jersey to support the team, and credit to you. However, the vast majority of supporters aren't best pleased with Puma's first attempt at Toon shirt. That said, it's all about what happens on the pitch and in St.James' Park.

We've a very tough tie against Manchester United first game of the season in Old Trafford, oddly the same first fixture in our last Premier League season when we were inevitably relegated. We drew 1-1 that day with Kevin Keegan in charge, and Obafemi Martins scoring the opener. How things have changed.

What do you think about Newcastle's new kits?

And one last thing, the very first picture at the start of the article. Is it just me or is Kevin Nolan's shorts a little tight?
