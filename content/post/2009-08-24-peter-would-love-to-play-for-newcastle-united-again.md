Remember him? Peter Lovenkrands? Well, he used to play for us last season if you didn't know and since then he has been relieved of his contract at Newcastle United, looking to ply his trade elsewhere. I think most people  will remember him, he fought for the magpies in every game, and scored three goals in his stint here as well. Signed by Joe Kinnear on a free from Schalke, Lovenkrands most memorable Newcastle moment would have been scoring the third goal against Middlesbrough which indeed proved to be Newcastle]s's last top flight goal that season. Speaking today, Peter said he'd relish the chance to play in front of the Newcastle fans again.

He said :

> 'Of course I would be interested in coming back to Newcastle,'
>
> 'I really enjoyed my time at the club and would certainly be interested in hearing what they had to say.
>
> 'As far as I know there has been nothing concrete from them although there has been a bit of interest. I have had a few offers from other clubs as well and there are a few things on the table at the moment for me.
>
> 'I know Newcastle are a Championship club now, but they still have great fans and I don't think they will be in the Championship for long.'

We hope he's right, and that we aren't in the Championship for long because we don't deserve to be, as the evidence is beginning to show. So, as regards signing Lovenkrands, sign him up. Free and not high wage demands, aren't we looking for players like that?

Comments welcome.
