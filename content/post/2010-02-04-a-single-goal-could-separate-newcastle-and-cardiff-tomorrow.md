![Michael Chopra is all out to beat Newcastle United tomorrow](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/9/29/1254260599264/Michael-Chopra-001.jpg "Chopra - Looking to end Newcastle's fine form at St.James' this season")

I've already talked about the importance of tomorrows game and I think it's pretty obvious that it could be a momentous win, should we manage to grab all three points against Dave Jones men. Chris Hughton is under slight pressure for the first time all season and a negative result tomorrow will throw the title race open to a lot more than just Forest, Brom & us. Cardiff have over come their bad patch which saw them go four nil up against Peterborough before throwing it away and settling for a draw.

I'm of the opinion that there could be a single goal in the game at St.James' Park tomorrow. Both defences aren't the worst and ours is the best in the league as far as I know (by a country mile ðŸ˜€ )

Leon Best is set to make his debut tomorrow and wouldn't it be lovely if he could grab a winner, or even a brace. Needless to say, Cardiff's back-four will be well lectured about Newcastle's attacking options tomorrow night.

As well as this, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if there's no goal in the game tomorrow at all. We've already failed to score against Bristol City and Derby at home this season, and although it's a small number of teams, we really need to be scoring in every one of our fixtures.

Apart from that there's not a huge amount of value on the Newcastle United game tomorrow, we are favourites but whether we'll live up to expectations and deliver the win, we'll just has to see. Hopefully come 10pm we'll have 3 points in the bag ðŸ™‚
