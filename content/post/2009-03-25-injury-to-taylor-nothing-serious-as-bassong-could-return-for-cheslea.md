### Taylor - Not as bad as expected while Bassong could return too

Good news today on the injury front as Steven Taylor who hobbled off against Arsenal last week could make a return for teh Chelsea game. We all thought that it was a serious injury and he nearly convinced us it was with the pain on his face he was showing! However it is reported to be a bruised ankle and that it's not as serious as first thought. Taylor is a player we really need at the moment and multiply that by two for Sebastien Bassong.             Chris said today :

_“We are continuing to assess Steven and Sébastien Bassong and we’re hopeful they could be available for Chelsea,”

“What we haven’t done at this moment is rule either of them from making the Chelsea game.”

“We are looking for an improvement over the next week or so and if we get that, they’ve got a chance but we’re not ruling either of them out 100%.”_

This is good news indeed as the Chelsea match, although we will more than likely be defeated is a very important one to say the least. After Chelsea we have Stoke away and unfortunately Rory Delap is back to his best, throwingwise. Ryan Shawcross's goal  last week was the result of a Delap throw and this is something we'll need to keep under control. Hopefully we won't concede too many throws and hopefully nick a couple goals of our own. Not a good season for sure but should we stay in the Premier League for another year at least, things will get better, I know it.

Comments appreciated 🙂
