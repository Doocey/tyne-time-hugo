![Colo - Opted to stay with Newcastle despite offers](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2009/9/13/1252855277993/Fabrizio-Coloccini-Newcas-001.jpg)

Despite having a torrid first season in the Premier League and indeed becoming the laughing stock of Newcastle's leaky defence, it seems that Fabricio Coloccini still had offers on the table for his services. Saying that, I'd expect that there was offers but ones of a laughable amount, and we wouldn't be too keen on seeing him go for pennies considering we paid over Â£10m for him last  summer. Declaring himself very unhappy at Newcastle on many an occasion you were almost certain that Colo would move away from the Toon, be it on loan or permanent, however, after collecting the MOTM award on Saturday, I doubt he'll be going anywhere any time soon.

Speaking, he said :

> _'I was annoyed. People were saying the only reason I wasn't going anywhere was because there weren't any offers,' he is quoted by the Sun._
>
> _'That wasn't true. The club and myself were getting a lot of offers.'_


Sure Fab, we all believe you. Ah no, seriously, I'm sure he did have some offers to move away but the wage packet at Newcastle currently is just too enticing for the Argentinian Â CB as it is for many other players who have come and milked the 'Toon train'

Although he's playing well, that's not to say we forget what he's capable of doing and it ain't pretty. Still an Argentine international though, some ask why, some laugh, either way it looks as if he'll be right behind a Toon promotion push this season, and rightly so.
