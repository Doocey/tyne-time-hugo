### Shearer - Would'nt have a problem starting on Saturday

Yesterdays training with Big Al was a success, with the fans, the media and the team. The team spirit was excellent yesterday as we all prepare for a nervy Premier League clash v Stoke. Shearer himself scored a couple in the training session to the delight of the 7500 fans that gathered in St.James' on a sunny afternoon. It gave the Geordies a while to forget the recession and to watch their Newcastle heroes. it was nice to see Joey Barton back, in the background of the photo and we really hope he can return soon to add some steel to midfield.

All woes were forgotten today as the players which included Ryan Donaldson and Johnny Godsmark. Both looked impressive in training from my reliable sources and one if not two of them could be well used in Saturday's game. That is indeed the burning question, who will start at the Britannia stadium. Sebastien Bassong and Steven Taylor are expected to be back for the game whilst Danny Guthrie is also expected to travel with the squad. There is now competition for places which is good and hopefully, hopefully our first eleven against Stoke can score a few to get us our first win in some time now. We certainly need it, for Shearer, us mighty fans and for our Premier league survival.
