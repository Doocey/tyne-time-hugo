We can't fault the lads performances over the season so far, two wins and a draw, that draw being a dreaded away trip to the Hawthorns for any other Championship side. However Newcastle United are not any Championship side, only at Newcastle could we  attract nearly 44,000 to a home game, mind you, it only being the third game of the season and the traveling Geordies weren't disappointed. Another Ameobi goal and another three points, leaving Newcastle 3rd in the Coca Cola Championship league standings. Just now there has been words from Derek Llambias that Barry Moat is 'there or thereabouts' on completing the Newcastle United sale.

Speaking to Newcastle's local BBC radio station the last few minutes, Llambias said he has spoken to 'Fans 410' and liked their idea, only thing is, the funds were unrealistic and the MD said he could never see it happening. Asked about Moat, he said that the local businessman was 'there or thereabouts' but also said that there were other consortia on the same stage in negotiations, basically saying that Moat is not the only one running and although Moat is Mike Ashley's preferred bidder, he might not be able to fund the project. We are sure to hear more about this, this evening. Stay tuned on Tyne Time.
