![Coloccini - Set to move back to Spain](http://static.hugedomains.com/images/logo_huge_domains.gif)

It might be music to some Toon fans ears, or maybe all but Fabricio Coloccini is set for a move away from Newcastle. The Argie arrived from Deportivo for a staggering fee of £10.3m in the summer when Kevin Keegan was at the helm but with  turmoil on and off the pitch Coloccini couldn't handle English top flight football and suffered, badly. There is no doubt that Coloccini is a very good defender in his own right but in fairness to him, the nonsense on and off the pitch was enough to wreck his first Premier League season.

Coloccini's agent said :

> “Fabricio is disappointed with Newcastle’s relegation and he wants to play more regularly,”
>
> “We are studying several options, all in Europe.
>
> “The boy does not wish to return to Argentina, even if some enquiries have been made.”

Not much said but enough for us to get the idea, Colo is on his way elsewhere. The question is, how much will he go for?

Comments appreciated 🙂
