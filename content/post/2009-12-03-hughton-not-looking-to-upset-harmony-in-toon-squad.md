###Â Hughton - Not buying a truck load of players this Jan

Chris Hughton may be after a couple of players in January but he's intent on not breaking the harmony within the Newcastle United squad at the minute. Or in simple English 'Don't fix it, if it's not broken' and how right it is. We currently lie top of the Coca Cola Championship table as we enter a busy Christmas period. This is down to Chris and the players for knuckling down, butÂ  especially to Chris. He's been working with the current crop of players since Kevin Keegan arrived that long time ago (2008) and he's connected well with every on the Toon lads.

Speaking earlier today, he said :

> _'What we have done so far is bring in the right type of person, and that's what we have got to make sure of again.'_
>
> _'We have got to make sure that come the end of January, we have got the right squad, we have brought in the right players'_

And while players have been linked with a move to the club, there has been rumours of players leaving this January, but Chris is adamant that none will depart.

> _'I have no interest in anybody leaving this football club.'_

Simple as that. It's pretty clear what we have to do until May and that's keep working hard. I'm sure there a lot of Toon fans already getting excited at the prospect of being in the Premier League again, but there's quite a bit of work to do yet.
