### Sultan - IS he still interested in buying the club?

There isn't much  happening with Newcastle United at the minute regarding news, it seems the same old news is being regurgitated everyday. Mike Ashley is still looking to sell but he's making the hardest job of it, he was quoted as saying the first Â£100m offer would seal the club but a few weeks ago Derek Llambias has said that there's been '2 or more' bids for the club. Surely one of them has offered the Â£100m? The bids are mainly believed to carry installments and we're not so sure Mike is keen on accepting them. The constant day by day 'ongoing discussions' is killing this club and as fans, we've been very patient.

I'm just wondering whether there is foreign interest and if the man linked to us a few weeks back is still interested.Â Sultan Oabood bin Said was rumoured to be after us and that speculation settled, however with the Malaysian Ananda Krishnan denying interest and the apparent bid from Hong Kong a phony, then who is the foreign bidders? The Singapore group said they're in a bid to buy the club but we're not sure how true this is. Then there's Freddy Sheppard who said he might be interested, yet again I cannot see him taking over as Mike Ashley doesn't get on with him. So, who is the 'foreign' interest? Maybe someone we've never heard of before, or indeed, maybe nobody.
