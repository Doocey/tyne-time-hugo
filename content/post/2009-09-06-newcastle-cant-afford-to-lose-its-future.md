![Vuckic - Becoming a target for big European teams](http://i25.tinypic.com/ap8m6x.jpg)

As I've said many times before, and it's been emphasised quite a lot elsewhere is the youth setup Newcastle United have at the minute and indeed the fruit we are bearing from it. It's without a doubt the best thing Mike Ashley implemented on Tyneside during his torrid tenure but I'm speaking as if he's gone, unfortunately he's not, just yet. A man who is attracting a lot of interest at just 17 is  Haris Vu?ki?, the Slovenian attacking midfielder. Newcastle completed a major coup when sealing his signature from NK Domžale and his dazzling performances in youth and reserve games hasn't gone unnoticed.

Most of the youth players at Newcastle didn't take relegation as badly as some others, they saw it as a chance to get one foot in the door of playing for the club and that is exactly what has happened. As of today, Haris Vu?ki?, Ryan Donaldson, Nile Ranger, Callum Morris, Tamas Kadar and Kazenga Lua Lua have all tasted first team football, something they wouldn't have dreamed of (as quickly), if we managed to stay in the Premier League.

So it's unsurprising to hear that Chelsea are trailing the Slovenian starlet, and all 6'2&#8242; of him. The good news for Newcastle is, Chelsea have the transfer ban implemented by FIFA following their unlawful capture of Gaël Kakuta from Lens. Perhaps the €780,000 fine of the French star was a little harsh but it definitely sends out a warning call to other clubs. Charles N'Zogbia to Newcastle from Le Harve springs to mind.

If we manage to keep Vuckic, which will be a task by itself, we can expect great things from the Slovenian, and many more first team appearances, to say the least.
