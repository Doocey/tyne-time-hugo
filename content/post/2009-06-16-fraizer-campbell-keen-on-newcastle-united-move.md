### Campbell - Would be a good addition

There is news today that Fraizer Campbell, who spent last season on loan at Tottenham Hotspurs, would rather join Newcastle United than Hull City. These stories are originating from the Chronicle Live which were  the only one to be spot on with takeover claims. Let's hope they're right about this one too because these are exactly the players we need if we are to have a successful promotion charge this season. An insider today told them that Campbell is aware of Newcastle interest and is waiting for the mess to clear down before deciding.

A source said :

> “Fraizer has heard that Newcastle United are sniffing around. And he is intrigued to see how things pan out up there.
>
> “He is well aware that there is some uncertainty at Newcastle at the moment. But he is waiting to see what the outcome of that is because this is such a crucial move in his career.”

Hull are confident he'll be playing in orange next year and you would think it would've been that way by now. We'll have to see how things pan out.

Comments appreciated 🙂
