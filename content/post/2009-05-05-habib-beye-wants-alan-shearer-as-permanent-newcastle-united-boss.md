![Beye - One man thats bothered about NUFC](http://images.teamtalk.com/08/10/330/Habib-Beye_1363253.jpg)

It's pretty clear that Alan Shearer has been a hit with both fans and players as he enters his 3 last games in charge of Newcastle United. Shearer who is from Newcastle himself, played for Newcastle and wore the prestigious captains armband, is wanted, by the players, as full time manager. Poor Alan hasn't had the best of times in charge but is doing all he can to save Newcastle United FC, alongside another man by the name of Habib Beye

Beye said :

> “He has passion.
>
> “He knows the club better than anyone and, I think, for everyone it would be a good boost.
>
> “You know when you have Alan Shearer as the manager, it is easier to attract some other players, because they will believe you have a good manager.”

We can only hope Newcastle avoid relegation this season and it will come down to the Boro game, like I said in the below article. Only luck and determination will save the mighty NUFC.

Comments appreciated 🙂
