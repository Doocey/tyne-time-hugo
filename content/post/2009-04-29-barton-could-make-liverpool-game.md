### Barton - Itching to come back

Joey Barton could well make the long awaited comeback for Newcastle at the trip to Liverpool. Joey was expected to feature against Portsmouth but didn't come off the bench. He is just after recovering from a foot injury and we've missed his bit in midfield. Nicky Butt has done a good job but the legs are getting heavy, Butt has played a lot of football in his day. Barton is someone who wants to wear the black and white and wants to repay the Toon fans for sticking with them through the bad times. Speaking today Big Al said he won't be rushing Joey back into the scene.

â€œIt was not right to put Barton in on Monday night.

â€œHowever, he will be having a full weekâ€™s training this week.

â€œHe will have that behind him for the weekend.

â€œHe could be involved at Anfield.

â€œIt all depends on how his training goes this week.

â€œWe did not know how the Portsmouth game was going to play out

I think that we are getting relegated this season unfortunately but I hope to be proved wrong. The only way is up for the lads if you ask me. West Brom aren't expected to make a second great escape, with Boro looking dead and gone. I wouldn't write Middlesbrough off just yet but I'm more concerned about us avoiding the drop. If Hull manage to lose all their remaining games and we pick up 2 wins then we can stay up. However with 1 win in the last 18, winning 2 would be a miracle. Fulham have done it, why can't we?
