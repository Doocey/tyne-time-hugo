Welcome to **Tyne Time**!

My name is Kevin Doocey I’m a life long fan of the mighty (sometimes!) Newcastle United, I write occasional opinion pieces on recent events surrounding the brilliant club that is NUFC. It is my aim to bring you a neat and simple interface in which to browse, free from spam, pop-up adverts and other cyberspace annoyances.

Although Newcastle United were relegated in 2009, a gentleman named Chris Hughton took the club right back to the Premier League the very next season, recording an historic 102 points in the process, the most impressive of any team/manager thus far. Unfortunately (and quite shockingly) owner Mike Ashley decided to sack Hughton in December 2010, stating that NUFC were looking for “a more experienced manager”.

We will never forget Chris’ contribution to the club, and the air of confidence, modesty and success he brought to what was an ailing Newcastle United at the time. He remains a welcome figure on Tyneside regardless of what dugout he now finds himself in. Whoever manages Newcastle, plays for Newcastle or does anything for Newcastle, we’ll be right behind them. Support the lads and I’m sure they’ll return the favour.

**Howay The Lads!**

Enjoy,

Doocey
