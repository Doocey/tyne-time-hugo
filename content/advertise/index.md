For the past seven years, Tyne Time has worked with various global brands such ranging from William Hill to Panasonic ensuring mutually beneficial advertising relationships throughout both league campaigns/pre-season breaks.

The aim of **Tyne Time** has always been to promote a clean interface for Newcastle fans to read about and discuss matters at St. James' Park. With that said, I am very selective when it comes to advertising. In fact, I rarely accept advertising at all nowadays unless it's a service/product/competition that would be of interest to the site's readership.

If you feel you have a service/offer that would be of great interest to my readers then by all means get in touch. Press releases and other promotional material are not welcome.
