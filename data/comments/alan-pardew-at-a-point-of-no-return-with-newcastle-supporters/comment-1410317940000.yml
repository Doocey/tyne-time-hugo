  It comes back to Ashley and what he is prepared to put up with.

  According to Joey Barton he is "The Ayatollah" and nothing happens without his
  say so.

  I don't hold with the view that some have about Pardew being Teflon and
  unsackable but i don't think he only has two games left like some media
  outlets are reporting.



  There are some tough games coming up and he has to win the Hull City at home
  game just to get a foothold.

  Southampton will take care of us without too much fuss so the pressure will
  really be on him on Saturday night.



  I had Pardew gaining 7 points from the first 18 available from the first six
  games and that was being kind to him.

  It looks like he is even going to fall short of the paltry tally i set for him
  before the season started.



  The Sack Pardew website has caused a stir but it bang on the money and when
  you read his excuses you could be forgiven that is smoking some good stuff.

  I thought the one about the grass being too long was an "Urban Myth" but low
  and behold he said it!

  The one about science being against him and the almost Stasi one about spies
  in the training ground tell you how deranged this man is!



  He has to go for me and has been nothing more than a passenger for the last
  two seasons.

  I said in another post elsewhere that the only form of entertainment on offer
  at St James Park this season would be watching Pardew's continuing Harry
  Houdini Act, And watching him dodging the bullet.

  It's just about how long Ashley will watch his sleight of hand team he put
  together by actually spending no money as usual not getting results.

  This side under Pardew's "Tutelage" (The Term Being Used Very Loosely) will
  not win many games.

  I just hope Ashley doesn't wait until xmas to call time on him because we
  could be in a sorry old state by that time!
