  IN my opinion I thought we were quite unlucky not to take all three points
  today, and three-nil to Blackburn was a very flattering scoreline. We'd been
  playing some of the best football we've played for a while, and had we scoreda
  deserved first half goal, this would have finished differently. The penalty
  which completely swung the game was ludicrous, all Edgar did was kick the ball
  away, no or minimal contact on Roberts, and never a penalty. After that things
  just went to pot.


  In regards to transfers, we have heard so rumours flying about the purchase or
  loan of players, but it would be great to see some written in paper, as we do
  really need to strengthen the team in particular areas, in my opinion
  midfield.
