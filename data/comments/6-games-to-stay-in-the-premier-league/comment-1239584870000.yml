  I am not thinking about total points we get. I think we should get to next
  game with full courage and belief of getting 3 points. We can beat spurs
  definitely. Its simple, go to every game to win it give 200% and hope for
  best. If we have this attitude we will gather more than 40 points. We should
  not target to draw any game now or even think of just targeting  3 games at
  home. As we might draw or lose 1 of these 3. So better win next game and that
  will be huge boost to everyone involved. I am more concerned about oba
  situation. I think he should be fit and play next game and score goal. he must
  score to prove he is dedicated to save Newcastle.
