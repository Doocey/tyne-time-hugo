  The fact that there are only 3 replies to this thread, I think, says it all! 
  There simply isn't enough interest in an NUST takeover.  And Doocey is right -
  if the funds couldn't be raised last summer when the club was available for
  Â£80-100m, there is no chance of this happening now that we've won promotion. 
  But it was a nice idea, and I applaud the people at NUST for actually trying
  to do something about a bad situation rather than just sitting on their
  back-sides complaining about it like the rest of us (me included).
