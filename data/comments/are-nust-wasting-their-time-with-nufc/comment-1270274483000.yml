message: "Spotlight Kid...what's the difference between you and Ashley? Maybe two..he's got lots of money and you know more about NUFC than he does. Why not put that knowledge to use? If you had the money, would you take the responsibility? If you would then join NUST and do what you can now. Fan ownership is coming to some club soon...we should do it here - where we have the best club, the best city and the best fans. If we don't own the lot then we have a duty to tell the other shareholders how the club could maximise community cohesion and economic development by better communication. Telling us all that we have to depend upon the decisions of the likes of McKeag, Westwood, Hall, Shepherd and Ashley and whoever \"buys\" us in future is a gamble we don't have to take. I trust you and I trust our fans...why don't you believe in yourself?\r\nBill"
