message: "For me theres no probabley about it. WBA played better and looked better. We got lucky, a great free kick and poor keepering saved us!\r\n\r\nOur defence was shacky and the WBA goals were poor from our side of things.\r\n\r\nHarper: 8\r\nSimpson: 6\r\nTaylor: 7\r\nColo: 6\r\nEnrique: 8 (at times) 6 (at others) so 7!\r\nGuthrie: goal apart.....6\r\nSmith: 6\r\nNolan : 6\r\nJonas: 8\r\nShola: 6\r\nLovenkrands: 7.\r\n\r\nA worried Toon fan !"
