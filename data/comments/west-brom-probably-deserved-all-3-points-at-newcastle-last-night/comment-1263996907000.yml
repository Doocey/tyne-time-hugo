  It's not the first time this season we've been let off by the poor finishing
  of the opposition. We'd be far further down the league if there were actually
  any decent strikers in the championship...sadly that includes our team.
  Luckily we have some of the best midfielders in the league with Guthrie and
  Nolan.
