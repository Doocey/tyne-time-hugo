  I really don't get you people sat on a pc writing comments about things you
  haven't got a clue about!!how exactly did our defense get "found out" we were
  up against a west brom side that had a point to prove after getting nailed by
  forest and we coped really well with their persistant attacks.seriously you
  need to grow up and I doubt that half of you have ever been to SJP but all
  feel that you can cast aspersions on our squad if any of you could do any
  better you wouldn't be sat eating pork pies commenting on needless attacks
  directed at our team.So in a word stop hating us and get behind us!!
