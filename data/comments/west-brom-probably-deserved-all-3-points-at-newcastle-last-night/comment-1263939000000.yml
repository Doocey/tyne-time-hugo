  we need pace on the right to match jonas on the left, play colo at RB hes not
  big enough a CB bring in another cb like mark beevers at 6ft 4 a pacy creative
  cm ohara? tom cleverly? henri lansbury? jack wilshere? and marlon harwood back
  there the positions that looked most obv to me last night we need more pace.
  but from last night west brom are a good side butrt i dont think we should
  worry they was at there best we was not our ow fault and they could only
  muster a draw
