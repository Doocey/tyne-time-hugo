  We have no pace in midfield. Nolan and Smith are plodders in midfield.
  (Nolan's best position is playing of the striker) Got overran. How we need
  somebody like Wiltshire. Simpson got found out big time against a good winger.
  Simpson was so scared of the winger I thought at times he was going to run
  into his own goal to keep away from the winger. The fat one will spend
  nothing. My main regret about promotion is that the fat one will "earn"
  another 100 mil for destroying the club. Its almost worth not get promoted to
  spite the fat one. The fat one will spend nothing in the summer. If he stays,
  I have nightmares about our midfield taking on Arsenal. Or should I say being
  overrun. If WBA can do it, Arsenal can do it a lot better and Arsenal's
  forwards will not miss.
