message: "WBA's game play was simple and we played right into it. We would flood forward to get a goal then they would hit us on the break and attack down our right where Thomas had Simpson everytime. In fairness to the defence they were often faced with a mass of WBA players when everybody else had gone forward.\r\n\r\nSimpson was not good enough last night and Guthrie didnt provide the support he needed against Thomas on the counter attack.\r\n\r\nNolans defending on both goal was awful, for the first goal allowing the cross in and on the second goal not closing down Dorrans, but instead preventing him from cutting inside which he didnt want to do anyway. \r\n\r\nI think we should have approached the game how Forest did, who closed out WBA first and foremost then attacked. WBA struggle against an organised team, but when we flooded forward, they loved it. \r\n\r\nHowever i disagree WBA deserved to win. They had the best chance with Miller, but Gutierrez's run at the end, nolans shot from the edge of the box, Taylors free Kick all spring to mind."
