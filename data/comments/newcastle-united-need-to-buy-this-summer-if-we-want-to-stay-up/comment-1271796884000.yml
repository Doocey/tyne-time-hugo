message: "I hope we stay well clear of dramatic signings that we've gone for in the past and build a squad slowly and do it the right way.\r\n\r\nÂ£15m is plenty enough if Hughton is careful enough, especially as I can see a couple going out. \r\n\r\nScour the free transfer market and get some freebies in, while take one or two loans in from the big teams. Wilshere, Macheda etc...need games at Premiership level, lets offer them that opportunity while we move a step closer to offloading rubbish like Butt, Smith &amp; Shola (who if fit will struggle to score against proper defenders)"
