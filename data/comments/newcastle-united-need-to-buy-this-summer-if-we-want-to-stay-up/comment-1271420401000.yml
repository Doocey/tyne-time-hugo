message: "hahahaha NUFC....... 1 million for Nicky Maynard???? What planet do you live on m8; especially if your wanting to sell Besty for 1.5 million????\r\n\r\nFulham were interested in Maynard last summer and were quoted 5 million by Bristol City; after the season he's just had i think you'd be looking at 5 million at the very least to even get Bristol city to start talking! quality championship player; but unproven in the PL.\r\n\r\nTommy Smith wouldn't get into my northern league side!!!\r\n\r\nFully in agreement with trying to take Cleverly on loan; as well as securing Joe Ledley on a free (although after having a six million pound bid turned down by stoke city last summer i think they will be sniffing around him again).\r\n\r\nFor me Vela on Loan for the season; Ledley on a free transfer; then i'd spend the entire budget on two quality players! \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost i'd sign Curtis Davies from Villa. Your probably looking at 5-6 million. We would stand a chance of getting him to as Villa need to sell; he is not first choice and is behind both Dunne and Collins. \r\n\r\nSecondly; we need a PL striker who can score sufficient goals to keep us in the division. The obvious choice despite him now being 29 is Robbie Keane. 6-8 million and i believe tottenham would sell. If robbie just wants to play football and isn't motivated by money then he is our man. 35k per week and first choice football infront of 50,000 passionate fans for the next three seasons could sway the deal.\r\n\r\nIn's;\r\n\r\nRobbie Keane; 6-8 million - Guarentee'd goals\r\n\r\nCurtis Davies; 4-6 million\r\n\r\nJoe Ledley; Free Transfer\r\n\r\nTom Cleverly; Loan\r\n\r\nThose four players would add to the squad; for me."
