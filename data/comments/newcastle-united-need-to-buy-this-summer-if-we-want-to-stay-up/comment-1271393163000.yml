message: "There is no doubt we will bring in players to compete with the Premier League, but if your expecting 10 million pound signings or more your having a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe squad we have is competant to keep us up. I have no doubt about that. Supporters need to temper their expectations. Our mission next season is to stay up. Spend wisely and stay up, therefor giving us a platform to get more funds in and spend a little more the year after and aim for a mid table/top 10 league position.\r\n\r\nThere has been talk of a 5 year plan to get to Europe, I can see how the club is going to do this, but some need to realise, we need to be smart about it. We have a group of lads that are professional and work hard to get the job done. I have no doubt we will stay up with minimal amount of transfers in, as this bunch of lads are capable of that.\r\n\r\nWe will spend probably no more than 10-12 million pounds and bring in a cbosman and a couple of loans. That would give us a sizeable head start if we stay up to build a football team capable of getting us to Europe in the next 5 years.\r\n\r\nTemper expectations Newcastle fans, next year won't be smooth sailing, and we will battle hard for Victories, but long term, it is the absolute right approach."
