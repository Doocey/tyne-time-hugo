  Not a bad player, left-sided, more defensive rather than creative. Don't be
  fooled that he scores goals - very rarely. Not that big so not really a
  physical presence, but can put foot in and win the ball and reasonable pace.

  But ... the big thing ... he's available for free and Newcastle fans will crow
  that he's crossed the great divide, even if he isn't all that good.
