message: "When have you ever won more cups than us?? Oh yeah before we were even formed. Why not check from 1919 onwards when there were decent teams to compete against and come back. If not, then let us catch up over 15 years worth and see then! Not to mention the fact we're on for winning 2 more cups this season.\r\n\r\nby3by3by3by3 \r\n\r\nOh and also if we get world cup your stadium wont be bigger than ours either, so lets see the attendances then eh! Small team that never won anything big."
