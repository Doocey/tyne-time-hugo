  I'm for beckford coming. I keep on hearing about his poor 1st touch but I
  don't see that as fatal. He could have a similar impact on the side to Bellamy
  in his first season - he only notched up 14 goals for us but his pace and
  movement transformed the way we played,, when you have pace in the side it
  stretches the pitch by forcing opp defenders to play a deeper line and the
  rest of our side will find more room and probably more chances to score
  themselves. He's become the no.1 football story of the week and for that
  reason alone it would be good to get him signed up - just for the boost he
  will give us for the remainder of the season... anywhere but sodding villa
  please, I still remember those messiah banners on the last day last season,,
  would love to stick one up that lot.
