  i would rather draw a blank whatsgoinonoutthere cos beckford is controlled by
  his agent beckford wasnt even heard of b4 leeds brought him. he had loads of
  trials with clubs and we only took the gamble as we lost all our strikers to
  selling or injury and when we did bye him we were in the championship and his
  goal to game ratio was shit thats why  we sent him on loan to scunthorpe who
  was in league one. i just think he is one of those players that cant make the
  step up ok he scored against man u but every lower league player plays better
  in the f a cup
