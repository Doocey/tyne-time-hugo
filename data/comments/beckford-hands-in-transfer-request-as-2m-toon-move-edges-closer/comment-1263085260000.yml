  iv just found somthing out lol. Jackie Milburn sould still be newcastles top
  goal scorer / biggest legend. just be'coz he scored 38 goals in world war 2
  then it gets deleted from his tally ( 200 goals ). so really Jackie Milburn
  should have "238 goals" to his name and still be newcastles top goal scorer.
  Alan Shearer's only has 206 goals to his name.
