message: "i think beckford is overated, misses a lot more than he scores and hes really dumb, not premiership material, is it really worth forking out 2 million! how about getting a few quality players in,  victor moses, or even billy sharp!\r\nThen sell mike ashley to sunderland for an undisclosed fee, then give llambias job as ball boy so we can all donate our hot bovrils to his empty head"
