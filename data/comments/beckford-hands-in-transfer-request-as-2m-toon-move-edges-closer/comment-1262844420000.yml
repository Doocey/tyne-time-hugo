message: "Dear me, you can tell its panto season,\r\n\r\ntuesday Matt Killgallon was almost certainly signing and Beckford look doubtfull.\r\n\r\nwednesday Killa commits to the Blades till the end of the season and Beckford 'hands in transfer request, on verge of deal.'\r\n\r\nnow betting odds have been cut in favour of a move to Villa!\r\n\r\nOne things for sure, I hope you have plenty of space next to Harewood, on the, un-used cost a packet strikers bench. People are saying he is lazy, has an attitude problem and misses twice as many as he scores. So all in all is he really that good, I mean if you put Shola Ameobi in a top of the league, League 1 team creating plenty of chances would he not score every game?\r\n\r\nDoes that mean these players have what it takes to play week in, week out in the premier league, i doubt it. \r\n\r\nBy the way, you can have Harewood back as well, he's s###."
