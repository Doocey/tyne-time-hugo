  Dave LUFC, there's no way we're as big as some of our fans think, like when
  FFS claimed we were the 8th biggest club in Europe because of our turnover, a
  lot of people lapped that up.  However, maybe as a whole we're not as big as
  we think, SBR used to consider Man Utd and Arsenal were the only bigger clubs,
  I think that was slightly misguided but we were the second best supported team
  and third best team when he managed us in 2003, but Liverpool are obviously
  bigger and Chelsea have become a global club since Abramovic took over.  We
  light years behind them four and may never bridge the gap, however it is
  insulting being compared to Leeds United in club size.  I can't think of one
  set of criteria that would make you a bigger club than Sunderland no one
  notices you you're just there.
