message: "Beckford would be a terrific signing for us!but I do fear he could join Villa with all the speculation mounting up!With Harewood leaving,and Carew and heskey both being linked with moves away,Beckford would be a bargin buy who could fire them to a top 4 spot!I still hope he joins Newcastle as it would be a move to a bigger and better club!\r\nCan I ask who started all this talk linking us with Nicky Maynard?there is no way he would sign for any less than £5m!It cost Bristol £2.25m to buy him last season so I there is no way they would sell him for £2-£3m!\r\nOne last point about to the idiot above who made a joke about are yellow away kit.I bought and I wear it with pride every away day,you pompous prick!"
