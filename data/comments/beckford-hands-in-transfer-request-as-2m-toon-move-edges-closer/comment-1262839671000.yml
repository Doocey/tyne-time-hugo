message: "Come on lads, to the ones saying that he misses chances...we are relying on SHOLA AMEOBI up front for f*ck sake, over the years how many chances has he spooned when it's been easier to score than miss? I would prefer someone like Ricky Lambert or Nicky Maynard personally but Beckford is better than nowt. We need a striker who plays on the shoulder of their defenders who has pace and guess what Beckford does both. Shola, Carroll and Ranger are all the same, we need another striker like Lovenkrands but better, and maybe Beckford can be. He's got to be worth £2m considering we payed £17m for Michael Owen who only went to Real Madrid for £8m.\r\n\r\nGet some perspective.\r\n\r\nToon Toon"
