  I'm not too keen on him coming here. I think he's overated, he's a League1
  striker, no disrespect to Leeds, good club, hope both us and them can be back
  in the EPL before long. He isn't even the top scorer in League1, is well known
  to go missing in the big games, bar Man Utd, and sorry but paying £2m-£3m for
  a League1 striker who is out of contract within 6 month's is just a big no no
  to me, I don't care if it was Torres, you just don't spend that much on a
  League1 striker who is out of contract in the summer. I think for that money
  their are better or similar players out there, who will be less of a gamble in
  my honest opinion.
