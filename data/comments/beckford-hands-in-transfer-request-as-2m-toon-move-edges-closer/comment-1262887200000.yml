message: "People Kris Boyd should be a no go in all his years at rangers he has scored once against celtic which proves if newcastle do get up next year then he will not produce the goals we need.\r\nAlso why not try Jamie O'Hara, i was listening to an interview with him on talk sport and he said if pompey could re-loan he would definitley look at the chance of joining newcastle, get him in loan with a possible transfer at the end if all goes well for him and the club , what do you's think ?"
