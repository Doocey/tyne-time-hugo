message: "What defeat?  Shut up ya sheep shaggin cunt, you're a mickey mouse club, you always have been always will be.  Newcastle is a proper football city, you come here you don't see people supporting other teams, you go to Leeds not even half the population support or care about the club.  Nothing club who half created an identity of being thugs in the 70's just a third division non event in essence though.  The day Leeds are a bigger club than us is the day we fall in to the third tier for the first time in our 118 year existence.\r\n\r\nSitting there in Division Three congratulating themselves they're a big club, they can't even fill their stadium for play off games heh.  Nothing club, must be painful to read but that's exactly what they are, they have no soul, Championship is their level in my view."
