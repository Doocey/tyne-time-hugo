message: "God knows why you want him, he has great pace but he's 26 so how long before he loses a yard or two. I seen him in over 100 games for Leeds, he drives me mad. On his good days he presses defenders, gets outwide, holds it up etc but these are so few and far between i've probably only seen it on a handful of occasions and less as he's become a big time charlie. The normal Becks is a lazy and arrogant moaner who, if you're lucky, slams one in the net after missing several chances.\r\n\r\nIt'll be a blow to LUFC but i'm incredibly confident that we'll get a good (if not better) replacement, we might even have a replacement already, Mike Grella who has more class in his little finger."
