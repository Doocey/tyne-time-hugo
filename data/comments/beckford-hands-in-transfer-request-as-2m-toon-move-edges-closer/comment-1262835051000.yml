message: "Worth a punt I'd say at Â£2million. Going by Leeds fan's reactions he seems to be a player you either love or hate.\r\n\r\nBig fish in a small pond to a small fish in a big pond comes to mind and I mean absolutely no disrespect to Leeds, my thinking is that he'd be mixing with \"prem\" experienced players for 6 months with the potential of promotion to the prem next season, could work out as a good deal for him and his future. Amazing to think he's not been a professional footballer for long either but certainly not the finished article yet. \r\n\r\nI'm more worried about any potential outgoings but there seems very little action in that direction so far, except for Geremi, so we may be ok."
