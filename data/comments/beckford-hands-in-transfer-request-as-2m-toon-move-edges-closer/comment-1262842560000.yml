  I think Beckford would be well fed off Carroll's flick on's. Leeds are tryng
  to play him as the CF but he's not that. He would feed off someone like
  Carroll, or Ameobi. Beckford doesnt hold the ball up as such, but he knocks it
  back to midfield. He uses his pace to do what Owen used to do, (before he
  became a penalty area goal scrounger), to play the last man. If Barton ever
  recovers his Man City form, he would slide horizontals directly from midfield
  to him.
