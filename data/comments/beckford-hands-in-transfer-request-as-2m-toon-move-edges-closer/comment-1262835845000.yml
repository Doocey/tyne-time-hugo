message: "kev im a newcastle supporter and agree with you when you say\r\n  \"its the fans that balls the team up with to much expectation all the time\" the players who come to newcastle hav to much pressure on there shoulders! but have to disagree on leeds being bigger, both clubs are small clubs with big support. 1st bit money we have forked out in ages so i suppose its better than drawing a blank. like some one said earlier tho is someone on there way out tho, asleys pockets have been sewn shut!!"
