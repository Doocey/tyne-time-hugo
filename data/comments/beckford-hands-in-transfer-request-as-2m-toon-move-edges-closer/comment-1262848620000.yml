message: "I doubt that he will be on his way to Villa, just seems to me that Villa can and wil be able to get better players, not that I am botherd if he does go to Villa, in all honesty I think you will be doing Newcastle a favour. At end of the day though, most of his goals have came against League1 teams or lower, apart from the Man Utd goal. Fair enough he played rather well in that game, but it was one game, what happens when he's playing a game and the TV camera's are off?, it's well known that he doesn't show up in the big games.\r\n\r\nI don't see MO being the kind of manager to take that sort of a risk on a player when he can attract much better, and he can afford much better. And by the way, who is to say Birmingham won't cough up that much, it's well known they have money to spend, and have only just bid Â£9m for Babel in the last 24 hours."
