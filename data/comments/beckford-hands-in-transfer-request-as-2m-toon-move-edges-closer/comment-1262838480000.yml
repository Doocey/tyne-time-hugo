  Dont know Lads I think his attitude and Ego are things that we dont need
  anymore, we have had to many big Ego's before. I think if lovenkrands got some
  playing time he would knock a few in. Saying that if we do get him I will
  support him while wearing the black and white, but we do have good strikers
  its just we dont have a regular pair, as we seem to start with different ones
  each match.
