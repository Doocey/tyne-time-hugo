  i think this guy is an ok squad player but is he really any better than what
  we got??? if you watch him for leeds he only bags 1 in 4 or 5 of his chances!
  and to be honest i dont think he will be any good in premiership, his 1st
  touch is poor and a decent defender will feed on his weakness! i hope im
  proved wrong, still think the club is on boggy foundations and want it all to
  be sorted out!!
