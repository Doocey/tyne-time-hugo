  Bates why mention "European Cup Second Round" various UEFA Cup QF's yet not
  mention the fact we've been in four European Quarters in the last 12 years,
  and one semi final as recent ago as five seasons?  I don't care who you are,
  no one who isn't on the wind up can say they are a bigger club than Newcastle,
  it's beyond pathetic.  Leeds United have a history which started about 1965
  and ended about 10 years later, that's it that's their history, but I don't
  think that ultimately defines a clubs size history even though we have 5 more
  major trophies than them.  It's almost unquantifiable, but how can a club who
  have no history of good support compare themselves with one of the best and
  most loyally supported clubs on eartH??  Leeds United have NEVER averaged over
  40,000 in one season in it's entire history, we have 33 times, and we will
  this season in the second tier.  I know some toon fans who are deluded who
  think we should be back in the CL in 5 years etc... but how HOW can you
  compare that mickey mouse club to us???  I fail to see how.  Sunderland are a
  much bigger club than Leeds let alone NUFC, it aint even an argument, and it's
  not actually possible to put an argument up for Leeds being a bigger club,
  they're nearer a Watford or Hull than a Newcastle United in my view. 
  Newcastle Championship average gate 44,000 Leeds when they went down 21,000. 
  No one notices Leeds, rugby city, big population, absolutely woeful support. 
  In fact in Britain as far as football is concerned, I think Leeds and
  Edinburgh, attendances/local population have to be the worst in Britain.
