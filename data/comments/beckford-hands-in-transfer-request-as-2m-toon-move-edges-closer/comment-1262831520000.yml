e taller than me (I'm 6ft) but not by that much. \r\n\r\nFactual accuracy aside, he plays infront of big enough crowds already, that's got nothing to do with his motives to leave. Like you or me, when offered three times the salary you're currently on, you change job. He isn't the kind of player that goes to a football club through passion, I assure you, but don't doubt you'll continue to romaticise this move regardless. \r\n\r\nI hope he does well for you. He's provided a lot of goals for Leeds and I hold no hard feelings towards him. TSS."
