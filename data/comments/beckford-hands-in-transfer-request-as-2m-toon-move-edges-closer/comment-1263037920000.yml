  "Robert Snodgrass" check newcastles history and count all the cups we have won
  then count yours lol. we piss all over u. plus get ur facts right coz we won
  most of our cups in the 50's and are u sure u wanna compair us to leeds in the
  past 15years lol. that will be from the years 1995 to now. ok lets do it. lets
  start with cups ( newcastle 1 / leeds 0 ) newcastle won the UEFA Intertoto Cup
  in 2006. now its longest time in the prem from 1995 - now ( newcastle 14 years
  / leeds 9 years ). now highest place finish in prem ( newcastle 2nd / leeds
  3rd ). now its how many times in Europe ( newcastle 7 times / leeds 4 times i
  think maybe less.only thing u ever had to be fair was a semi final in the
  champs leage but after that it went downhill plus newcastle have been in the
  champs league 2 times compaired to your 1 lol. plus we helped u with ur fall
  as well coz we beat u to 4th spot in the prem after that season and u needed
  that 4th spot b'coz u needed the champs leauge money. then u went in the red
  and down u go lol.... so leeds are on the road win league one yh lol. well
  newcastle are on the road to win the Championship and back to the prem we go
  lol. do u know why tho ? i'll tell ya " coz newcastle are bigger than leeds
  lol ". now shut it and suck on Peter Ridsdale balls coz that the only thrill
  u'll ever have lmao. oh and 1 more thing. i cant beleve that leeds are so poor
  that ur hoping that the world cup comes to england so u'll get a bigger
  stadium lol. the only reason why newcastle fans are hoping that the world cup
  comes to england is b'coz we want to see football come back to its real home,
  not so we getta bigger stadium. leeds must be poor lol. now hurry up coz Peter
  Ridsdale is waiting 4 you lol.
