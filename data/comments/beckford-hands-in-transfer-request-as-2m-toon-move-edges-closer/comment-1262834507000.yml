message: "No doubt Beckford can finish, but also definately the most dislikable \"street rat\" in football. Can score goals, but has never been a \"hero\" at Leeds !\r\nSo, a player with a massive \"attitude problem\" will only add to the problems Newcastle already have. \r\nShall see Backford in the Championship next year, cos he does not have the intellegence to make it in the Premier League, even if you get there !\r\nBye bye \"scuffer\" Beckford."
