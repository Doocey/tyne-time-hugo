  hi i am a leeds fan and i aint that bothered he is goin ok he scores all them
  goals but he is one lazy player. every one keeps going on that leeds wont
  score without him but i think it will be easyer without him give some of the
  other players to shine insted of playing in his shadow all the time so good
  luck newcastle with him
