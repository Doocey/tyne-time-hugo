  If we sold against Boro it would've beaten your record gate.  There's not one
  way you can explain to me that Leeds are a big club let alone not as bigger
  BIGGER than the toon.  Leeds United.  Club who's never averaged over 40k in
  its history.  I'm trying to put mesel unbiased in a born n bred Leeds fans
  head, nah we're still a shit club.
