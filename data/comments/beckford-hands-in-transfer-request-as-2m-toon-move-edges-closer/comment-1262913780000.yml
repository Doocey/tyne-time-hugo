message: "Leeds fan here, I'd just like to say I think Beckford's been a great deal for Leeds United, we signed him for Â£40,000 and he's probably worth 100 times that now, so if he goes I wish him well.  I don't know how he'd do in Premiership, but I will say this, worse strikers than him have scored goals in that league.\r\n\r\nI was born in Hunslet near Leeds, but when I was 19 the family moved to Ryton as my dad was in the RAF and wanted to move nearer to Boomer.  Football in Leeds has never been as big in Leeds as it is in Newcastle, but don't criticise the Loiners as you don't really know about NUFC till you live here, but Leeds certainly are a more succesful club in the last 50 years, but I have to concede football is more important in peoples lives in Newcastle you have always had more people willing and able to go to games, and you're more newsworthy nationally, or the papers certainly seem to think so!! So marginally I'd say Newcastle were bigger club."
