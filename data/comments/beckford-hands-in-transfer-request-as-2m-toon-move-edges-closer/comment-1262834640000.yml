  The only way beckford will go to villa is for a cash dela only no chance of
  him part exchanged for harewood as hes on 28,000 a week at villa and no way
  would leeds pay that amount of wages. the best thing id for beckford to come
  to the toon have a few months in the championship get bedded in with the team
  and then he will get his shot in the big league when we are promoted at the
  end of the season and for 2m certainly no gamble anyone remember ian wright
  started at palace at age of 25 and look how he ended up playing for arsenal if
  this guy is half as good as him great
