  not a bad deal for newcastle, as the way i see it its a win-win situation, hes
  great scores goals in the championship and premiership for 2 million or fails
  to grab his chance we could still sell him in a year or 2 for 4 or 5 million.
  and to the bitter leeds fans out there he was always going to choose newcastle
  over leeds, newcatsle are by far bigger the leeds there is no competition. we
  havnt won a great deal in our history but thats still more then leeds, we have
  a bigger stadium, bigger world wide fan base, bigger home crowds, newcatsle as
  a business make more money then leeds, bigger sponsers than leeds, more
  expensive players, higher wages then leeds, oo and the biggy we take all your
  best players, so remind me how leeds are bigger :S
