message: "I gave up reading that after the first scentance. The fact you regard \"the intertoto cup\" as anything special as well as your texaco cups, makes me laugh - for such a big club that you are. You also wasted that Champions League spot \"u nicked from us\" as you couldnt even qualify, thats what the small teams do, such as Shelborne and Everton. \r\n\r\nThe only thing you can hold claim to is the fact you won the FA Cup more times. 3 times in the 50s, and you're telling me thats when you won all your trophies. What a small minded club you must be. We dominated the 70s. You dominated NOTHING. You also conviniently missed out the fact we were in the European Cup final and got robbed then by some cheating officials. So dont give me \"the only thing you can claim is SEMI FINAL of Champions League\". In fact, yes, at least we qualified, unlike your massive club eh!\r\n\r\nFootball got big post war, and you haven't won a top division since. Congrats! Massive achievement! Were there even European Competions back pre war??!\r\n\r\nWho is your biggest legend I ask? Alan Shearer, well he won nothing with you, and he is the ultimate legend??!!??!!!!!!\r\n\r\nNow stop pretending and face facts. Have a think about it in the Sport Direct store.. oh thats @ St Jame's Park by the way."
