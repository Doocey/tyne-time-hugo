You can't even sell out play offs, yet we've had 44,000 in against Peterborough and the like.  You are the most deluded club in the world bar none.  I didn't even realise you classed yourself as a big club, let alone BIGGER than Newcastle LOL.  It's like comparing Man Utd to Rotherham, yes, truly."
