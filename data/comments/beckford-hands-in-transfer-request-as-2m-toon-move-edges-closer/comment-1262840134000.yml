  There certainly is better than Beckford out there but as Reality Check and
  myself have said, we need someone who offers something different. We already
  have a few 'battering rams' (to be harsh) and we need another Lovenkrands,
  except younger and more energetic.


  Maynard is my preferred choice but the likes of Beckford, Chopra aren't the
  worst one could ask for.
