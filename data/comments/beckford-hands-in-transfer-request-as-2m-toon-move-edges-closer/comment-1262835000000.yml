message: "i think beckford is overated, misses a lot more than he scores and hes really dumb, not premiership material, is it really worth forking out 2 million! how about getting a few quality players in,  victor moses, or even billy sharp!\r\nThen sell mike ashley to sunderland for an undisclosed fee, then give llambias job as ball boy so we can all donate our hot bovrils to his empty head"

 to think he's not been a professional footballer for long either but certainly not the finished article yet. \r\n\r\nI'm more worried about any potential outgoings but there seems very little action in that direction so far, except for Geremi, so we may be ok."
