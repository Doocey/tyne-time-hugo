message: "Jermaine will go, I am sure at some stage. His heart is not at Leeds. Depends on the agreement he has made with the club. Wait until the summer and see what happens or cash in now and take the gamble. Time will tell which is the best approach. Either way, LUFC will be in the CCC next season and Beckford will either be a legend or forgotten.\r\nMOT"
