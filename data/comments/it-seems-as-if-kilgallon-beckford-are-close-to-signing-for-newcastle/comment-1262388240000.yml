message: "No-one is keen on his attitude but we've got Barton FFS and Bellamy was one of the best strikers we had at this club...we NEED footballers who think they're the sh!t because we have a squad full of 'could be good players'. Maybe we just need players who instill that confidence thinking 'i am the t!ts' and the others might start buying into that ethos.\r\n\r\nI'm all for Kilgallon and Beckford because it's better than the Stoke reserve defender and Harewood/Helgusson, Killa and Beckford are young-ish players, with something to prove...not 30 year olds looking for their last pay day.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think we couldn't go wrong by trying to get Tom Cleverley on loan or even a pipe dream of Jack Wilshere."
