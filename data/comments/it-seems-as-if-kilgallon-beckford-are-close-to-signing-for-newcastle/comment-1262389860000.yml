message: "I'd be very happy with Kilgallon and Beckford - two good buys and we have to hope they can hack it if we make it back to the Premiership this season. I also think that Khizanishvili would be a decent squad player for us - if we can get him for a really low price. Zurab can play central defense or right back and Kilgallon can play central defense and left back. And all 3 players apparently are dying to come to Tyneside - so that's good news too. Oh - and we need to tie up young Danny Simpson - whether now for a small fee - or for free in the summer. Would also like to see some young players brought in - to continue the youth policy started a couple of years ago. Ranger, Kadar, Krul and Vuckic are all stars of the future at Newcastle. Then we need another 8 game winning streak starting against Reading a week tomorrow. That would be a decent start to the new year for most Newcastle fans.\r\nHoway The Lads!!"
