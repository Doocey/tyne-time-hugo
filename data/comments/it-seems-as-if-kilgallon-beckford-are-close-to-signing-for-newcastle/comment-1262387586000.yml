  Kilgallon is a must for me ,as every time i see him ,he really seems to be
  getting better and better .He can also fill in at left back if jose gets
  injured ,as he left footed and has played there for sheff utd .Danny simpson
  ,we also need to tie up ,fergie made him  eligeble to play for us in fa cup
  ,and the lad a good player and seems to be loving it on tyneside .Beckford is
  a maybe for me ,not keen on his attitude ,but for 1.5 mill ,he will score
  goals .
