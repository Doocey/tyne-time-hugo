message: "Bert\r\n\r\nNow, now, no need to be peevish.\r\n\r\nI will be delighted if we keep all our first teamers and if we also get Killgallon and Beckford, together with at least getting Simpson's loan extended, it will be the best transfer window for ages.  \r\n\r\nI am getting greedy now, as I would really love us to sign an attacking wide right player to balance the team, and if Barton lives up to his reputation and supplies the energy and skill in the middle of the park, we will be well set up for the second half of the season to consolidate our top of the league position.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year Doocey  (keep up the good work in 2010) and all fellow bloggers.  Lovely to hear from you again Ed, Happy New Year to you too.  Are you setting up your blog again anytime soon?"
