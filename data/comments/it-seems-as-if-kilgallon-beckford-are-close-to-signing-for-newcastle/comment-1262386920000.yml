message: "Certainly better than Helgusen, guess he wants his day in the sun against Man U. @ Old Trafford though, thats ok !\r\nWell that sounds a bit better two possibly decent signings, though Beckford is somewhat of a risk, but at probably less than 2m. not that big a risk and the kid may come good."
