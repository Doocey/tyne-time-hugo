  I think they would be two good siginings, but Danny Simpson!!! He has some of
  the worst ball distribution I have ever seen, and surely if he was premier
  standard Fergie would have recalled him whe he had no defenders!!!!!!! We
  should take a look at Jason Shackle a decent centre half, he is with wolves
  but on loan to Darlo, played with Norwich last season on Loan from wolves as
  part of an agreement when wolves bought him. Also does anyone think we could
  do with a bit more creativity in the middle of the park? I know we are doing
  ok but the game against Derby highlited our lack of Midfield creativity, we
  were long ball, up and under footy!!! Anyway, happy 2010 to all Toon fans,
  KEEP THE FAITH!!!!
