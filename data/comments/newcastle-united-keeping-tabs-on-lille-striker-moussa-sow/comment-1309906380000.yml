  Sorry but ne chance of this happening.


  Non-starter. TB H we need to look at another league than France now for our
  stikers. We've tried (allegedly) and failed with Gervinho, Gameiro and in all
  likelyhood Erding. So whats the point in getting a French league second rate
  striker?


  Sow would be class but this is media BS nothing more. I think we should start
  looking at the German and Dutch leagues now and see where we go from there.
