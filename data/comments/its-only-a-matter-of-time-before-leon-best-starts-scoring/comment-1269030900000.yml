  I don't think he has had enough minutes on the pitch yet to decide he isn't
  good enough, he has often come on late with the game won. He is an honest
  player who should not be judged on goals alone, his ability to hold the ball
  up and bring others in to play is excellent, he is very much a team player,
  this sort of thing is often ignored when you are a striker not scoring. His
  cross for Carroll against Swansea was excellent and a sign of what he can do
  and I think if he is given more time on the pitch he will come good.
