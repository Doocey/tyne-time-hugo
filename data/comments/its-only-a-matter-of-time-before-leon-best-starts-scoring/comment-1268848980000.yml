message: "Wishful thinking, I fear.  Best has scored 10 goals in 30 or so appearances this season, making him an OK player at Championship level.  We signed him on a 3.5 year contract (I think), but I’ve seen no evidence to suggest that he will be able to cut it in the Premiership – Hughton obviously thinks otherwise.  He is already a bit-part player for Newcastle, so if he isn’t good enough to hold down a place in the team this season, what chance does he have next season?  Our other targets during January (Beckford and Moses) might have been able to make the step up to the Premiership.  When we didn’t get either of those we should have just given up on signing another striker in January, the better option being to leave it until the summer and seeing who becomes available once we have (hopefully) won promotion.  \r\n\r\nI really don’t know why we signed Best.  We already have Lovenkrands, Carroll and Ameobi ahead of him in the pecking order.  And is he really any better than Ranger?  We had the perfect opportunity to give Ranger a chance to develop, by letting him have some time on the pitch in a team that is doing well / creating chances etc.  But instead we’ve just wasted money on a striker who is probably going to turn out to be useless to us, and at the same time stunted the development of one of our up-and-coming youngsters."
