message: "Does he have a case ? sure.\r\nDo you believe he wanted to end up being hated by thousands of Newcastle fans, after such a promising start to the relationship?\r\nIt has been unfortunately for everyone \"a comedy of errors.\"\r\nHis first mistake was getting shafted by The Halls &amp; Freddy, \"buyer beware\".\r\nHe intended I believe to base the club on the system used by Arsenal, \r\nHis second mistake was to hire people who either knew nothing or too much about the game, naifs and hustlers.\r\nWhich continues to this day.\r\nThe fans were not particularly helpful, being mainly responsible over the years for the revolving door policy of managers and following the success of Sir Bobby, the club was short of funds and in decline.\r\nDoes he deserve the treatment from the fans, not really, the most he can be accused of is Ignorance, perhaps stubbornness,lack of communication and as far as calling him parsimonious, he has spent quite a lot, in fact taken a bath.\r\nCan anyone blame him for wanting out, not really, but in this economy it aint easy to find that kind of dough."
