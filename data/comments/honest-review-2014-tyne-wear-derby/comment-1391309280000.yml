  I wish to applaud you for your frank and honest assessment of the game today.
  I am friends with many toon fans but generally get a biased and distorted view
  of games especially derby matches. Normally they point out 1 incident and use
  that as an excuse. ( many Sunderland fans are guilty of this also ). I prefer
  to analyse games and accept when we get beat by the better team, which is
  often, unfortunately. I honestly felt confident this morning and what
  materialised didn't come as too much of a surprise because even though we
  sometimes lack quality, Poyet has instilled fight and belief throughout the
  team. Couple that with losing your best 3 players and therefore hence the
  confidence. Once again, thank you for the honesty it is very refreshing. Shame
  more aren't like you.
