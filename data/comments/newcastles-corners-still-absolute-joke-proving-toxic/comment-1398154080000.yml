  100% agree, but i've been complaining of corners for a lot more than a year.
  Newcastle winning a corner is honestly like just giving the ball back to the
  opposistion for a goal kick. we are completely useless, and its all pardews
  fault. what does he see time and time again when he's re-watching our defeats.
  does he not see that the current system from corners is a long way from the
  standard required?? I always considered corners to make up the very basic
  fundamentals of the game, one of the first things you need to get sorted.
  pinching the odd goal from a corner leads to wins from draws, draws from
  defeats etc and can change the entire flow of a game in your favour -
  unfortunately just one of many things pardew is not getting right at toon.
  time to leave pardew
