  Good post Doocey,

  Hba has been impressive and all praise has gotta go to AP.

  We,the fans gave him green because he wasn't playing him but Pards has done a
  great job in teaching him about his team duties and overall work rate.

  He most certainly would fit into most teams in the top stage.

  Valuation?

  Definitely would make 25 to 30 if to more
