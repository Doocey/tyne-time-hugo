message: "Cisse, Ba, Tiote and co and brilliant players, but HBA has the potential to be on a different level.\n\nGoing on his technical ability and natural talent he could grace any team in the world, its just getting it out of him on a\_consistent\_basis, and also he needs to learn when to try that cheeky turn and when to play it safe.\_\n\nRunning with the ball at pace the close control he has to be one of the best in the league, the time the defender chasing him has taken one stride Hatem has had 2/3 touches of the ball keeping it under his spell.\n\nLike i said, Hatem can be as good as he wants to be, as he has all the talent in the world.\_"
