  We paid 2.5M for the initial season long + 5.5M for the option to buy = 8M. 

  Also Ashley isn't just starting to get things right, he's doing what he set
  out to do all along it's just that fans are starting to believe in him again
  after the results of this season.  Also, Ben Arfa needs to perform and stay
  fit for at least 2/3 seasons before he is entitled to 'that' claim.  Cracking
  player though and can be a toon great if he stays.
