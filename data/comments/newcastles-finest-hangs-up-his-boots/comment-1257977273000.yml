  Thanks and I hope you enjoy your time on here.

  Ed planned to close it just before Alan Shearer got the job in April but
  decided against, he again considered closing it in the summer after the club
  was relegated but he didn't feel it was a right time either.

  With a new job, his favourite team top of their respective division it wasn't
  the worst time to leave.

  All the same, I was a regular visitor of his 'blog amongst millions of others.

  Doocey.
