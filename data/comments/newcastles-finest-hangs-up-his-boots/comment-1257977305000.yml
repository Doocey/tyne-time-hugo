  It's a sad,sad day knowing that you are leaving us Ed. You have enlightened me
  with up-to date articles over Newcastle United many times. You have been a
  true fan that wrote from the heart and I will miss the many discussions
  amongst fans over your entertaining articles. I WILL REALLY MISS YOUR GREAT
  ARTICLES AND HARD WORK ED. GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE AND TAKE CARE.
