message: "Yeah, on reading the above, shifted to Ed`s site to thank him and wish him the best.\r\nCan`t believe the viciousness of the final comments, to-wards a guy who although we may not have agreed with, was trying hard to produce something of interest and entertainment.\r\nHey, two long years of producing a daily group of blogs, takes hard work and dedication, regardless of the fact it`s about something close to ones heart.\r\nHope he finds gratification and success in his new endeavor. \r\nAnd thank`s Ed."
