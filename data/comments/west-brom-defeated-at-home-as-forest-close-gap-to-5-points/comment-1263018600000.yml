  Shane your right, the way the Mags are going you don't need to care about
  other results, it is in each clubs hands. The thing to worry about is if we
  (NUFC &amp; NFFC) get promoted have we the teams to stay up. As a Forest fan
  born in Nott,m and lived in the Toon for 23 Years I feel for both. Hope you
  beat WBA next week.
