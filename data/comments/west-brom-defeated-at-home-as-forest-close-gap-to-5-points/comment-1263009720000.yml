 had a wobble
  recently and are still well clear which is a great sign. Mentally, Forrest and
  the Baggies believe we will win the league but having them both capable of
  decent runs keeps us on our toes. I never expected to be this far clear at
  this point and think we will power on now and win it by 15 points. Good to
  have it lively and I hope  Forrest go up with us and that the Baggies get
  knocked out of the playoffs. Toon Toon !!
