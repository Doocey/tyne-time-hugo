message: "Surprisingly the game was on live over here in the US - Forest played so well - and deserved the win if only because they approached the game so much better than WBA. If WBA play like that in defense a week come Monday we'll take them apart. They looked very ordinary last night - but our future is in our own hands - and it's up to the lads to put together another win streak - a long one - we will determine our destiny this season - nobody else. \r\nHoway The Lads!!"
