  Some guy on the Toontastic forum reckons he's got it on good authority he said
  theres no mention of the take over just Shearer/Carver management team and
  apparently Stevie Taylors staying as one of Shearer's conditions wether
  there's any truth in it i dont know all we can do is carry on doing what we've
  been doing and wait and see BTW a cracking result last night only one goal but
  3points all the same a hard game against Palace coming up but i really fancy
  our chances and i'm sure the lads will be well up for it
