  Lennon? Are you kidding?

  What relevant experience does he have?

  Bit of a difference between climbing onto the favourite in a one horse race
  and stepping into the 7th pit of hell at SJP with little in the way of
  success, players or money.

  What has he actually done that suggests he could do the job?

  Moyes would be my pick. His success and consistency at Everton with nothing to
  spend have shown that he knows what graft is all about.
