  Neil Lennon would also make my shortlist for the next manager.

  Would bring passion, and Champions League experience with him. Has played at
  the top level, and his style of football with Celtic is encouraging.


  Going to make an article out of Neil Lennon and post it next; the pros and the
  cons of his potential appointment.
