  My theory... Ashley has offered him a player-manager position when P45dew is
  sent packing. Makes sense as... 1. Colo &amp; Ashley met up the other day. 2.
  All of a sudden he's happy to stay even though we know there will be little
  investment in the team. 3. As an experienced international he'd have respect
  of the players. 4. Ashley would save money as he'd have one person doing two
  jobs.
