  From the comment below regarding the appointment of lennon

  from celtic. I like it! I’ve never thought of him as toon boss until now, and
  I

  reckon it isn’t that far from possible. Surely he’d be keen for a change now,

  must be boring easily winning the league every season, and they are only ever
  realistically

  capable of winning the second tier European comp and that’s only when the
  don’t

  sell their best players, which they’ve been doing recently – wanyama etc. 
  Lennon might work you know, and id take a shot

  with him over Pulis anyday. 

   

  Happy to hear colo is staying too, one less player to

  replace – C’Ashley will be pleased.
