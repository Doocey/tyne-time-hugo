  Nope not kidding, and moyes would still be my top pick too,

  but Lennon would be worth the gamble. What’s he done to deserve it? Oh how

  about winning like 7 league titles, 9 cups, and having some pretty decent runs

  in Europe. That’s pretty good experience in my book, maybe even better than

  moyes, albeit Lennon in a much easier league. Financially, celtic don’t spend

  much either – no one decent ever wants to play there, so very similar to toon

  in that regard.   I see moyes and lennon

  as being pretty similar, hard nosed, no nonsense kind of guys that would get

  the players busting their hump, which is well overdue. If moyes wasn’t keen, I
  wouldnt

  be too upset to have lennon come on board.
