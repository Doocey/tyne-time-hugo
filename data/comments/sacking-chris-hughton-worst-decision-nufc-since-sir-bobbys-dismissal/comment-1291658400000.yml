  Morale could fall through the floor if Chris gets sacked, it's no secret that
  all the players have great admiration for him. We've spent most of the season
  in the top half, despite everyone saying at the start that 17th would do (and
  it would). In this sense, its nearly a shame we're doing so well, because a
  couple of bad results here and there leads people to talk about a "crisis" and
  other rubbish.
