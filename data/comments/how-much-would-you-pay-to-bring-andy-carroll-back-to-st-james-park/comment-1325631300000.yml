  You speak of "lazy journalism"? This article is littered with factual errors
  and what is left is based on the author's completely misguided opinion. 


  Do you just type anything that comes into your head, love? 


  In fact, you're so poor you leech off lazy journalism to produce your own
  brand of even lazier journalism... get a job, you bum.
