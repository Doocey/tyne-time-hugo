  Hi I'm a Liverpool fan and really want andy to be a success. I don't think
  he's had the opportunity to show what he can do at Liverpool just yet an I can
  see he's highly rated by the Toon Army. He was never worth 35 mil, but who is?
  I hope he stats with us and I feel that he'll start to show his worth if he
  does. Anyway good luck with the rest of your season.
