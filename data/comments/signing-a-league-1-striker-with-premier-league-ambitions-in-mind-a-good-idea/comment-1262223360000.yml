message: "Leeds United fan and fellow blogger. Ran with this story too - http://www.thescratchingshed.com/2009/12/january-transfer-window-beckford-to-newcastle-united-gradel-and-martin/\r\n\r\nAlso not sure as whether he could take the step up to the Premier League, but certain he could do a job in the CCC. If he's not going to cost you an arm and a leg and does produce the goals that take you back to the Prem, he's worth every penny. After all, at that point you can sell him again and you'll have made a fortune from the Premier League monies."
