message: "Beckford Eh?\r\nTaking a risk but for 1.5 mill.why not could turn out to be another Andy Cole.\r\nWhat appear to be the alternatives are a rumored Boyd from Rangers, a proven goalscorer, but would cost a lot more, plus unproven in what might be a step up, the PL.\r\nThen there`s Harewood who has gradually improved and has five goals, problem is he has never been a great scorer and is around thirty , as apposed to the other two in their mid twenties.\r\nLooking at a possible deal for Beckford @1.5m. plus 2m. for killgallon, strengthening both CD and CF, sounds like good business."
