  Sky Sports are saying we could probably get him for around Â£1.5m because he
  will be out of contract at the end of this season.  If this is true, then he
  is probably worth a punt.  I'd much prefer Beckford to Harewood - Harewood is
  cleary too old, too slow, too talentless, and probably too expensive (despite
  some of the fans getting carried away as usual becuase he scored a couple of
  tap-ins).  We need to be signing players who can cut it in the Premier League,
  which we know Harewood can't, but can Beckford?  I suppose there is only one
  way to find out!
