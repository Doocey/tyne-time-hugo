message: "In January, Beckford is able to negotiate with other clubs providing he sees out his contract at Leeds until end of season.  \r\n\r\nTherefore any money Leeds can get now is surely better than nothing at the end of the season.  I cannot see any club paying more than Â£1.5m as they could negotiate a deal with the lad direct for the following season."
