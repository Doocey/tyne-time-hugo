message: "Jermain Beckford has shown he is far too good for League One. Far too good. The guy scores for fun.\r\n\r\nHe has pace and guile, an eye for goal, and is full of confidence, so why not get him in? It will be a step up for the lad, but so to will be the players around him. We are a step or two above Leeds and Jermain should prosper with the likes of Gutierezz, Carroll, Ameobi, Nolan, Smith, Guthrie, Barton etc all around him. These guys are international quality players (maybe with the exception of Guthrie and too soon for Carroll). If we get him in positions to score, I am confident he will score. We need his type.\r\n\r\nDan Egan says we need to find another Peter Beardsley? Well he may not be in the same class as him yet but Tom Cleverley from Watford via Man United is the guy I want desperately. He is a playmaker, wonderful talent and would help our midfield creativity heaps.\r\n\r\nI think we will get Matt Kilgallon and Jermain Beckford this transfer window and hopefully sign Danny Simpson permanently. Good business that will hopefully carry us back to where we belong, The Premier League."
