  It seems to me that Beckford is a natural goalscorer and these guys will score
  at any standard, given the right support. Look at Andy Cole - we signed him
  from a club who, albeit in the same division as us, were not the same
  standard. With our brand of attacking football, Cole quickly settled and as we
  progressed so did he. So I would say it's all well and good signing Beckford
  but maybe we need to find another Peter Beardsley as well. Easy said than
  done???
