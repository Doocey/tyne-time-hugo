message: "There are a lot of players in the same situation as \r\nBeckford.\r\n\r\nThe two Cardiff players Joe Ledley (who we have been linked with in the past) and who quite a few premiership clubs are sniffing around now.  \r\n\r\nBut more interestly to me is their right back Adam Matthews - although he is only 17, he is playing for the Welsh under 21 team."
