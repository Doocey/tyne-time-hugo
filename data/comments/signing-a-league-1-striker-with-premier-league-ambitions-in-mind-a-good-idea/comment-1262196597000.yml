  I have commented on this guy on my previous post..great striker and I would
  love for him to be the one to replace harewood and in the long run I believe
  even shearer's goal..great potential from the lad.

  Another couple of players I really think we could do with are hull's Nick
  Barmby, Bolton's Ricardo Garner and George Boyd from Peterbrough.Both players
  would bring in a much needed creative influence on our team..
