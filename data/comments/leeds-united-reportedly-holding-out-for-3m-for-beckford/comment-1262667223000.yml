message: "Dear ToonArmy2010 laughable comment \"If u lads want to turn down £2m ,then let him walk at end of season for nowt; that just typifies what bates is all about\" So you're saying, Bates values promotion over a mere £2m; sounds a great chairman rather than a greedy money grabbing fool. Exactly what is your point?\r\n\r\nEven more laughable is criticism of Bates given your own, er Owner. Bates may be a right b****** at times, BUT knows how to run a football club. We make profits, we invest in players and are a club on the up. You've made a great start but . . . the weaknesses are just beiginning to show aren't they? Let's face it your challenge is on the edge. You will pay whatever we want for Beckford simply as he is a MUST have. Ha ha, £2.5m for a striker who won't do a thing at a higher level; kerching!"
