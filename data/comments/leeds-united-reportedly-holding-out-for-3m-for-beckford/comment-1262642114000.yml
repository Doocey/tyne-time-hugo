  nobody will pay 3 million pounds for a player that's out of contract in 6
  momnths, clubs know they will be able to save on the cash and offer him a
  massive contract, newcastle have learnt their mistakes and with the financial
  pickle you're in I can't see Ashley parting with much brass. I have a feeling
  we'll keep Beckford until the end of the season, he'll score the goals to take
  us up and a middle of the road premiership team will sign him on 30k a week
  and we won't get a penny, if 3million came in for him it would make business
  sense to take that and lets face it - its peanuts for a man with the amount of
  goals he has in him.
