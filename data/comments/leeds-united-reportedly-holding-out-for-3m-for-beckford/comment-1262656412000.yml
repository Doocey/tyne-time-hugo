message: "To be honest lads, he'd die for a move to a club like Newcastle United.\r\nHe doesn't want to be playing in front of 1,000 people every Sat/Sunday, instead, he wants crowds of 35,000 +.\r\nNewcastle can provide this.\r\nPlus he'll have better players to work with, Nolan, Barton, Smith etc.\r\nIt's a no brainer for both sides.\r\nSplash out Â£2m and he's a Toon player, simple as."
