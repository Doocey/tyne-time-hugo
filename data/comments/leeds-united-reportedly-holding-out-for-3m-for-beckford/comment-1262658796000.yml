Your not a bigger clu than Leeds, hahaaha\r\n\r\n\r\n*************\r\n\r\nMight be a hard pill too swallow, but Newcastle are a far bigger club. Just because you had a decent time in the Premier Leagues years back, like Newcastle, doesn't mean you're the biggest club around.\r\nTo be honest, Leeds were never that big, just big money and big debts."
