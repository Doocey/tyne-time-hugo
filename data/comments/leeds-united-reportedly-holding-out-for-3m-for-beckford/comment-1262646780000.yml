message: "Icedog-why is asking what you want for a player that belongs to LUFC til the end of the season being greedy? Isn't it just getting the best deal you can like any club would? Why when its Leeds United or Bates then is it classed in your world as being greedy?\r\nAs for Newcastle being able to pay Â£3m-ha ha I havent laughed as much since we beat Near Manchester Disunited yesterday! The Toon are potless, badly run &amp; deep in the do do debt wise so you couldn't afford him anyway! Stick to the cheap loan deals lads thats all your worth!"
