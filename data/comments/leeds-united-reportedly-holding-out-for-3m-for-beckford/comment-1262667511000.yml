  So Jimmy, what makes a big club? Fanbase, history and trophies i guess. Yip
  the deluded Geordies know how to pull in the numbers alright but . . . better
  wash over the history and trophy aspects, eh? Given the amounts you have spent
  in the transfer market over the last ten years, you are probably the most
  underachieving club in English football. Laughable, and why you will always be
  'cartoon'.
