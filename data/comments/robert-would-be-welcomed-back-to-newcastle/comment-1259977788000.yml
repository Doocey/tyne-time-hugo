message: "have been working as a coach with the New York Red Bulls and seen Laurent Robert play for Toronto FC in the MLS. This guy is not the player he once was. As a massive NUFC fan he would not add any thing to what we have in class, only another option if needed... \r\nTo be truthful we have limited creativity in the middle at the moment, Laurent Robert is old and not the direct answer we need. However if he is cheap then a contribution to our goal difference my be what were needing. \r\nOur longer term vision is to bring in some of our young lads; Lua Lua on the ball will offer questions to opposition with runs on the ball. I do admit he is young and limited experience; however from the few performances he has played he has shown promise in some areas of his game with relatively good technique. He needs a bit more guidance and purpose to his game this would and can solve the issue for cover and introduction to the game. He could be a good player and have a similar part to play as Kieran Dyer was."
