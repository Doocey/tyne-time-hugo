  Scotty, I have to agree, if Ash sells us now we will be screwed! We will end
  up with the NUST running us which would be a fate worse thatn death!! Or Barry
  Moat who couldn't afford to buy us earlier so even if he raises the cash to
  buy us how will he afford players? Oh I know, just like Fat Fred he will
  borrow and put the club at risk. Please can fans stop blaming Ashley for
  everything and get behind the club as a whole!! Things could be a shite site
  worse, we could be Crystal Palace or Pompey!!!!
