  Completely agree, we&#39;re always going to have people like this though. All
  the lads have done well this season, dont get on any of their backs and lets
  just see what happens, we cant control the team and we shouldnt be heaping
  negativity from booing or such onto our players.<br><br>the boo boys will be
  back in force now we are in the premier league and the real fans need to drown
  that out of our club.<br><br>we should support anyone that plays in a black
  and white shirt.
