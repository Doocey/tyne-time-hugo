  Leon Best&#39;s record is atrocious, he has averaged one goal every four games
  throughout his career playing at clubs like Coventry and Crewe.  His last
  season at Coventry he was doing okay, but nothing I have seen makes me think
  he could score goals in the premiership.  He is a division one/championship
  striker.  We need striker that can score 20 goals in the premiership no goals
  from 13 appearances in the championship (albeit inc 7 sub appearances)
  suggests he was an atrocious buy.
