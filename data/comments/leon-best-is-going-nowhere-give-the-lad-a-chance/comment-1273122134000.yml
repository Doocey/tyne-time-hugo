  Give the guy a chance, I thought we Aussies were fickle especially with the
  AFL clubs we support. Leon is only 23 and still has plenty of improvement left
  in him. Think of him as a work in progress. Next season I think he will
  surprise a lot of the boo boys once the ball goes in the back of the net the
  first time for him.
