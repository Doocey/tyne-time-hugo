  Hirdy - There can only be improvement because he can&#39;t possibly get
  worse.  No pace, no vision, no discernible skill.  Coventry must have laughed
  all the way to the bank.  The lad is so far out of his depth it is unreal. 
  The only reason to have a player like that at the club is to make ameobi look
  good!
