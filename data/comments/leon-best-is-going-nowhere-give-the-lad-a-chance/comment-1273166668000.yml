  Is there anything more childish than people saying "you obviously don&#39;t
  know anything about football if...."???<br><br>THat is to suggest comment
  isn&#39;t valid if it doesn&#39;t match your own? One of the problems with
  newcastle has always been the lynch-mob scapegoating players for their pound
  of flesh.<br><br>L Best may or may not work out next season- from the bench,
  but  any successful club has to give players a fair crack. I&#39;m sure
  hughton will bring in another striker regardless. <br><br>The benwell rat boy
  bile that you read on these pages,, honestly it gives us a bad name.
