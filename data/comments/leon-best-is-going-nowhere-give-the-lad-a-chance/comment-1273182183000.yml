  Coventry fan and this season Leon looked like a new player and I was gutted
  when he left. Holds up a ball as well as anyone and will win a lot in the air
  too. Against Watford away he was awesome, they couldn&#39;t handle him, which
  we could&#39;ve done with last week!<br>I believe the problem is without doubt
  confidence, every successful striker scores at their new club early on and he
  hasn&#39;t and therefore I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be a success at Newcastle
  (Forlan for example at United, European Golden Boot twice since he&#39;s
  left). Until January I would&#39;ve said he was on for top goalscorer and
  would&#39;ve walked into any side but since looks half the player.<br>I think
  you have to remember it&#39;s an intimidating atmosphere for the lad, walking
  out at St James Park and he&#39;s bound to be feeling the pressure.<br>If you
  don&#39;t make the signings give him a chance cos despite Andy Carroll&#39;s
  success, I&#39;d rather have Leon, If not offload him while he&#39;s still
  worth something.
