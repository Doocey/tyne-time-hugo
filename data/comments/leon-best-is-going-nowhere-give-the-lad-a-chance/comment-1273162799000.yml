  I&#39;m a Coventry City fan. And to see you&#39;re ridiculous comments about
  Leon Best, it makes me laugh! Have you seen his aerial skills? have you seen
  how he can hold up the ball? Leon Best is a pure goal scorer. Hughton is not
  giving him enough of a chance! How many players score on their debut? not
  alot. If I were a Newcastle fan, I would want rid of Shola Ameobi
