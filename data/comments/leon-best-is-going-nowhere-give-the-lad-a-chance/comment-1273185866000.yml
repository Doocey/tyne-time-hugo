  Johan - so you actually have the ability to say anything without using the "F"
  word? Very mature! And yes, he failed in the championship for us (unless you
  are you a Coventry fan?). <br><br>As for "boaterboy". Blind faith is one
  thing, burying your head in the sand and pretending everything will work out
  is another. When someone clearly isn;t cut out for the job, just accept
  it.<br><br> No doubt you both thought Souness, Big Sam, Marcellino, Boumsong
  et al all  deserved a chance too? Didn&#39;t they all work out well.....
