  What a load of rubbish how low can this guy go he was never going to sell the
  club over the last year he's completley frozen Alan Shearer out of the club
  tried to paint Kevin Keegan blacker than black admitted that he's lied to the
  press public and supporters put the club on the market twice never bought any
  players now suddenly he says he wants to inject 20 million which will probably
  be used in running costs as the window is closed and it cant be used to buy
  players that we desperatley need and now wants to rename the ground why so he
  can pocket some more money he'll probably change the kit to red &amp; white
  stripes next i just can't believe how this nightmare is continuing to be
  played out in public and making the club become a bloody laughing stock
  were/when will this all end just when you think things cant get any worse
  something even more ridiculous happens
