message: "Hey ! i`m glad he did`nt sell to some bunch of hustlers ( as they say in Texas \"all hat and no cattle\")\r\nAnd re naming the stadium is not that big a deal, if it brings more money to the club (it will be known forever by the fans as ST. James Park)\r\nAnd yes it`s very good news that Ashley realizes we have to strengthen a small and not very talented side.\r\nIt`s obvious he is not about to gamble on promotion and understands it would be more difficult if not accomplished in the first season.\r\nLook the present economy combined with the fact this club is in the second tier of football, does`nt make it the most attractive 100m.`s worth.\r\nI really dont care if (person you hate most) owns the club as long as they \"do the right thing\" in regards to the wellbeing and future of the club.\r\nYeah I realize there are those who will disagree, but a little pragmatism please, would you rather see Ashley spend 20m. or be at the mercy of some hustler who can`t even match the asking price &gt;"
