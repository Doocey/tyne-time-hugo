message: "(Chuck) I'd rather see Ashley spend 20m. But when have we had a reason to believe anything he's said since he's taken over? Especially considering he's actually told us (indirectly of course) that lying seems to be a good public relations exercise... He was a billionaire when he took over, how could he not find a few spare million for a few players back then? Was Newcastle really in so much debt that even a billionaire couldn't sort it out? Apparently... what a complete waste of a human specimen. And congratulations to you, Mike, now we're relegated you're worth nowhere near as much. Business genius you are!\r\n\r\nAs for renaming the stadium, I'm not exactly excited about it. But if it brings in some money which actually helps fund the team and not just line Ashley's pockets, then we could do it, at least for 1 or 2 seasons. Then we can go back to being St James'! Or better yet, the Sir Bobby Robson Stadium... But if we rename the stadium and he turns up to the next match in a brand new helicopter, I'm calling the police."
