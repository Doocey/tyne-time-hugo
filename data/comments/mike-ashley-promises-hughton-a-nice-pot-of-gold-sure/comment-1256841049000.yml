  BTW can't the City Council do anything about the re-naming thing as we know
  Ashley owns the club etc but does he own the land the club is built on ? if
  not and its owned by the council surely they would step in as SJP is part of
  the heritage of the city i still can't believe this and in doing this Ashley
  has shown his utter contempt to the very people who turn up week after week
  surely this is a step to far even for the most ardent fan i know we have to
  get behind the team but the way things are going if Ashley is allowed to carry
  on doing what he's doing we wont have a team to get behind
