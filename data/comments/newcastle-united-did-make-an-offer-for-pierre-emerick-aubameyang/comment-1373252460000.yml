  finally won somthing i follow and andy murray won in style and it feels great
  and tennis doesent hit me in the pocket like football does supporting
  newcastle i feel newcastle needs to start delivering the fans have been loyal
  enough the time now is that if newcastle is showing no signs of showing
  ambition to compete with the big boys we should not be so loyal and not turn
  up till things change
