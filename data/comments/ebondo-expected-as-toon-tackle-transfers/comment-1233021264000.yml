  Keep it up Doocey.


  Tis kidlooks a tidy buy as will provide cover for Beye and at the same time
  learn a lot from him. Which is what I feel is letting Jose down on the Left
  someone to push him and learn from.


  On the Given situation, I really dont want him to leave but it is a situation
  where we have more than adequate cover and will ensure Krul and Forster stay
  to fight it out for the bench place.


  Owen.----------BYE!!!!!  I feel he has been almost as bad a buy as Luque never
  come to the plate when we really have needed him especially of late and at
  around Â£1.5 million per goal has been a disgusting return from the man we took
  back to England when no-one else wanted him.
