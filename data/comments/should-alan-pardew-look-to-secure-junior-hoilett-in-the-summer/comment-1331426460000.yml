message: "And Tiote must be nursing a broken jaw from his vicious beating the other day right?\_\n\nAlso Jonas never dives does he?\n\nLook mate, as much as I hate it, it is actually part of the modern game now and to snub a player of his quality for a dive against us would be crazy.\n\nWould you not have Ronaldo playing for us just because he's a big girls blouse who dives every chance he gets?"
