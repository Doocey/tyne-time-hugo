  We really were unfortunate last night, had we converted our early dominance
  into a second goal i think the game may have been ours. Unfortunate defending
  by Steven Taylor with the second goal, but the incident with Ronaldo was
  unacceptable in my opinion. With the injury crisis we have, we need every
  played we have to be playing, but we are losing our heads so often, i.e Nolan
  a couple of weeks ago and Taylor last night. If we carry on like that then we
  may start having some problems. I agree with the Vidic comment, he knew he was
  beaten and did it to save his team. The phrase 'agricultural tackle' springs
  to mind when you watch that tackle.


  Regardless, if we show that determination and style of football that nearly
  earned us a point against what looks like the Champions, we should be fine.


  One final note, was that it was great to see the fans get behind the team, and
  give the players a deserved standing ovation at the end.


  Keep up the good work Doocey,
