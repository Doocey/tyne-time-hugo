  Thanks.

  Well to be honest he's been left with a bad situation on his hands but on the
  plus side our injuries are clearing up :) Hughton is a very good coach but
  perhaps that is his limit, I have the upmost confidence in him and indeed
  Calderwood to keep us up :)

  But to answer your question simply - There is better than Hughton out there
  but for now he's the man in the job :)
