  The main worry now is injuries we know by the time Tuesday comes at least a
  couple more of the current players will be away its just who is bought in to
  replace them were doing well in the league a good result last night i would
  have hoped the new signings we keep hearing about would be here by now and not
  left to some panic signing on Tuesday
