message: "Sell Barton and Guiterez for 9 or 10 million and bring in a couple of players on loan then if we get promoted sell the club for 200 million after making 35 million on player sales.\r\nThis would leave a new owner needing to invest heavily to keep us in the premiership, probably the NUST.\r\nAnyone who thinks Ashley is a fool needs their head examined, he may look stupid but he will have removed as many assets as possible before he leaves.\r\nExpect our prospects Carrol, Ranger and Kadar to be sold at the end of the season before new investors buy him out."
