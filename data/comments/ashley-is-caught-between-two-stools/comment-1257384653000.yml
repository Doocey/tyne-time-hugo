  I thought the two stools must have meant Wise and Llambias. Ashley will not
  put any money in for new players. He will probably put the club up for sale
  again in January and again use that as his excuse for not buying new players.
  His puppet will be required to look at the loans market. We cannot believe a
  word that comes out of SJP these days. But I suppose that NUFC supporters will
  moan and groan for a short while then put up with it and go on filling the
  pockets of this fat waste of space.
