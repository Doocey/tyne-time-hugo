  That should be the line up for today. Looking forward to Tiote completing his
  ban too and seeing our best 11 back together. It's been a long time since
  we've had a full strength squad. Hopefully everyone can stay fit up until
  then. Will be a tough game against WBA but I think we will nick it 2-1. NTID
