  Well with all the premiership expierenced players we already have i dont think
  we will struggle to stay up . Do not think we will challenge for Europe though
  ;), an injection of 4 or 5 new faces all prem quality and i can see us doing a
  Birmingham , Ohara would be a great signing . Would like Ryan Babel on loan
  from Liverpool with a view to a permanent deal , the lad has talent but for
  some reason hasnt quite done it at Anfield , would be worth a try .
