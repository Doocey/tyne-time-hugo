message: "I appreciate the effort Pancrate has given to Newcastle. When you look at his history with other clubs he doesn't particularly score many for a pacey and powerful player you tend to believe he is.\r\n\r\nUsed as a right winger but I don't see why he can't become a striker, pending whether or not he can finish.\r\n\r\nI don't see him as a player we will want to keep hold of, but no doubt he would have no problem finding another club to play for, probably back in France no doubt though."
