message: "Good man Doocey, congratulations on your blog site. \r\nYeah it`s unbelievable,  the old \"who`s on first\" baseball routine would be appropriate for the way this club is being (or not) run.\r\nWith a decent squad (2nd tier standard) but thin in numbers, it`s only a matter of time before we will be playing a teamfull of youngsters.\r\nIt`s in everyone`s interest to ensure this club is promoted, therefor our owner should be looking to strengthen the side , not sell players.\r\nHe made that mistake last season, a bad gamble, which he could  repeat again this year."
