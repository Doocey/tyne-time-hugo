  Seen a few videos of him looks a decent player. Im still dubious as to who is
  making the signings though.

eed two of
  the existing strikers - Rangers is on his way (quick but un-co-ordinated) and
  I am not convinced about Best (good for Championship and lower half of the
  premiership). Ameobi - when he is on his game - yes; Lovenkranz as support
  player. So we still need 2 strikers and if one is not a guarenteed 20+ goal
  scorer we need Zog back because he will score 10. I would throw the bank at
  Sturridge, Gomez, Defoe or Pavlychenko and then take one of the current to in
  the press. We need someone with real class.
