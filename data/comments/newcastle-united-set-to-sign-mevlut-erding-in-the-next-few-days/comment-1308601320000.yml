message: "NO CAPITAL OUTLAY!\n\nEnrique and maybe Barton will move on and the money for those 2 will buy several more bargain basement players. Ashley will conveniently forget to spend the Andy Carroll money and the club source will again remind us\_ of the clubs \"dire financial situation\", how \"there wouldn't be a football club without Mike\" and \"Mike hasn't taken a penny out of this club\".\nNothing has or will change with these tossers at the helm of the club. \nForget this at your peril."
