  Depressing but realistic assessment. I agree Charnley is out of his depth, a
  man promoted beyond his capabilities, unsuited to the role and is so grateful
  to the owner for the job he has been given that he follows his leaders
  instructions to the letter. This has been Ashleys MO since buying the club
  with all his appointments.. To be fair to Charnley (its hard I know) he is
  working within the constraints imposed on him by Ashley which will be set in
  stone regarding wages and fees. Add to that the lack of drive and ambition
  then its a disaster. I agree we wll make some signings (and probably sell a
  couple) but they will be nowhere near enough to lift the club out of the
  doldrums. The appointment of Captain Bob and McClaren to the Board is a
  cosmetic exercise in an attempt to appease fans but it wont work judging from
  what I hear from fellow fans. Does McClaren realise the position he is in and
  is he, like Pardew, grateful to be in the Premier till something better comes
  along? He is already starting to sound like his predecessor. Nothing has
  changed.
