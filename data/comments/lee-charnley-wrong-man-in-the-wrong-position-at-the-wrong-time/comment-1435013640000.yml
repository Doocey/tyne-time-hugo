  How can you say " the true magnitude of the overhaul is lost on charnnley and
  the majority of others on the board" ? FFS we should have been relegated, we
  lost eight games in a row, what evidence did they need? Carr has been in
  football for over 50 years, Moncur the same, your just making excuses for
  them, every news agency has been going on about our threadbare squad,, we need
  a minimum of 8 players that includes a back up keeper, most sane people can
  see that, they are getting paid thousands per week to know this, charnley has
  been in football long enough, he watches the f******* games as well as us,
  don't make excuses for his and the rest of the parasites ineptitude and
  greed,,,,,
