  Look Charney is just a puppet. His strings are pulled by the Porker. He has
  probably never had an original thought in his life and I think hat is what
  Ashley requires. I won't believe the club will invest until I see players at
  the club posing in the shirt. I assume we won't get Charlie Austin coz he
  wouldn't accept a zero hours contract.
