  "I want anyone who's reading this to hum the tune to "The Wizard of Oz""""""
  Chumley doesn't have a clue "??,He's Spashleys Whipping boy and hasn't had ANY
  experience in the job he has been given,It's a case of Splashley asking
  ,"Which idiot can we put into this position who doesn't know what he's doing
  and will ask me what to do" We need a Scarecrow without a brain ,So that's
  what happened from " Boot boy to Managing Director " ,Splashley  said ," He
  will  be forever in my debt " , He will tell me everything ,even when Sissoko
  scored that goal against West Ham he turned to me with clenched fist and a
  gurning grin looking for my approval .."Oh what a smashing Patsy I have his
  nose has Never looked so Brown ..."

  " Oh we're off to see the Splashley the wonderful Splashley of St James"..HWTL
