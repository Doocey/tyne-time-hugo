  My eyes were drawn to Perez his partner in breaking up play. I was watching
  Perez as hes the type of player i love watching no nonsence all or nothing
  sort of player, but Arevalo kept catching my eye as well.<br><br>Either one of
  Perez or Arevalo would be so awesome. Arevalo is at a less of a club so hes
  the more likely to come. He looks fat to be fair but is in the right place at
  the right time!
