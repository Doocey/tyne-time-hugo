  Agreed Robby Bobson Perez was brilliant, a younger version of Arévalo.
  However, he&#39;s with Monaco and would carry a pretty sizeable price tag
  before he&#39;d even consider us. Unlike Perez, Arévalo is 28, plays for
  Penarol and would be moving on soon enough. There&#39;s little chance
  we&#39;ll get him, or even go for him, but I think he&#39;s a very decent
  player. Looks like I wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed.
