  Anthony Annan was very good indeed at the World Cup with Ghana but he&#39;s a
  very highly rated youngster and is being touted with a move to clubs like
  Aston Villa, Napoli and so forth. Little chance we&#39;d get him but he&#39;d
  be a very good player for Newcastle as well, good spot Fozzle.
