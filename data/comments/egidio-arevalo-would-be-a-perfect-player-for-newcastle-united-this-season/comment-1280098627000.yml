  He hasn&#39;t signed for AEK. I&#39;m from Uruguay, and a Penarol fan also, so
  I know Arevalo as he played in my club. According to the local press in
  Uruguay there are two clubs intending to sign him: one of them is Newcastle
  and the other one is Cagliari from Italy. He a great player, playing in a
  vital function for any team. Hope he signs for Newcastle!!
