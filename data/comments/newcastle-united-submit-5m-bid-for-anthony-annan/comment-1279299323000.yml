  like all newly promoted clubs, Newcastle will only get the players more
  established clubs don&#39;t want . . . . thats the way of the world ! There is
  a pecking order, and like it or not, newcastle are WAY below the likes of
  Bolton, Wigan, Birmingham and (sorry to say this) Sunderland in that
  list.......newly promoted clubs only get the scraps the bigger and better
  teams throw them....FACT
