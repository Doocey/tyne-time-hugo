  I&#39;m Norwegian too, and cannot agree completely with Are. Anthony is a
  fantastic defensive asset to any side, but he has had some "fair play issues"
  that will probably need addressing. However, this season he has improved a
  lot, both in the way he has played and the way he has handled himself in
  heated situations on the pitch. He&#39;s been in the media for being
  "unsporting" several times this year, but really, it&#39;s nothing more than
  using what strengths he has to succeed in the game, since he is ridiculously
  short.  <br>Should he sign for the Magpies, he certainly would be a great
  asset to the squad. Nothing gets by him, and he has single handedly stopped
  countless counterattacks for RBK the past two seasons. <br>Note that Anthony
  Annan is a defensive player throughout. He cannot shoot the ball, he is very
  rarely the man that sets off an attack or counterattack, I can&#39;t remember
  ever having seen him win a header.. <br>Would I love to see him in another
  black and white shirt than the Rosenborg one? YES!
