  I&#39;d like to say it again...this is surely not a guy that would fit in with
  our current squad. He would be bad for the whole team. But anyway, not likely
  at all. The rumor came from a random norwegian dude who had posted it on the
  rumor site on skysports, and then a journalist made a big deal of it. There
  has been nothing in Norwegian media linking him to Newcastle. <br><br>Hughton
  also said today that he expected two signings. A class striker, and a backup
  for Enrique. <br><br>In other words, no Annan.
