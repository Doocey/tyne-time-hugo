  Well The Sun say's aload of old toss these days, the price if we would go for
  him would be probs 2m or 1.5m as Leeds know he won't sign a contract with
  them, clubs such as ours and Bolton are after him and will want what they can
  get for him. Beckford, Kilgallon, Simpson and Skjelbred would be the perfect
  january transfer window for me but as we all know it won't happen.
