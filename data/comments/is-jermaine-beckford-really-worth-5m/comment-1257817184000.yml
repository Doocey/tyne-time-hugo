message: "I think Beckford is worth this price for sure! He could net some goals, enough iam sure, to send Newcastle back, and a goodbye and a leave from the wankership! We must also try to buy Matthew Kilgallon from Sheffield United for a nice price, and sign Danny Simpson permanently! \r\n\r\nThen we can score some goals and hold some clean sheets! \r\nBig Nufc Fan from Norway"
