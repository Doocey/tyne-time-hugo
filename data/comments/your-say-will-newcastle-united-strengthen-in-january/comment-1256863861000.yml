message: "Name : Jermaine Beckford\r\n\r\nPrice: £1.5M Leeds Utd (Cut price as in last year of contract)\r\n\r\nWhy: Reminds me of Andy Cole, he's proven he can score in League 1 &amp; Championship and I personally feel he'll be capable of scoring in the Premiership.\r\n\r\nName : Per Cijan Skjelbred\r\n\r\nPrice: £2.5M Rosenborg\r\n\r\nWhy: We've been after him for what seems to have been an age, he has the creativity we lack in our midfield and is more than capable of scoring a few goals aswell. Also he's only 21 and is a Newcaslte supporter.\r\n\r\nName : Erik Huseklepp\r\n\r\nPrice: £2.5M Brann\r\n\r\nWhy: We were after him last year and in the summer, has a number of admirer's with Chelsea been linked to a bid before transfer ban. Basically this kid has what we lack on the wings, crosses and goals, one of them players who can turn nothing into something.\r\n\r\nCan't think of any others I would like but these 3 players we have been linked with loads, so it wouldn't surprise me if we bought them. But also would as Ashley bit stingey on the dosh. Can't think of any defenders that I would like except from Song from Arsenal but thats it."
