  I've now come to the conclusion after this weeks latest instalment that Ashley
  couldn't give a toss about this club,the fans &amp; the people of Newcastle
  and the transfer window will come and go with no money spent on players unless
  he goes all i can see is more and more heartache for the club and fans i
  expect he'll try and sell Stevie Taylor and anyone else he can come January it
  wouldnt surprise me if he started digging the turf up and start selling it on
