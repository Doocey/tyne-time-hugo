  craig chisholm is spot on. Anybody who thinks Ashley will spend a single penny
  on new players is fooling themselves. It should be clear by now that Ashley
  only uses transfer windows as a way of lining his own pocket by asset
  stripping the playing staff. Expect the likes of Steven Taylor, Nolan,
  Colloccini and Smith to be sold in January with the only incoming transfer
  activity being a couple more carthorses on loan.
