message: "anyone whothinks ashley is investing any money in players is a nobber.  He has told you already in his own statement that he is not buying nay players.  He said he is investing 20 million in the next week.............well, saying as he cant actually buy any players till january and he is investing it next week, its safe to say he is not (as usual) investing a penny in the squad. Its a known fact that he has to pay off 12 million with immediate effect to reduce the barclays loan to under 10 million - its the rules and we are at 22 million right now. So that leaves 8 million.  3.2 million goes to KK and that leaves 4.8 million.  Thats about 5 spins of the roulette wheel for fatty.  Why the fcuk everyone thinks he is going to buy any players is beyond me ffs! houghton is looking at getting a loandeal on carl corts 30 year old brother - who is shit, does that sound like mike is investing??  does that sound like we have any chance of ever getting out of this div (in an upwards direction that is)?  No, it does not.  Also, you have to remember and face up to the fact, that if we dont do it this season we will have no chance next, cos many of the players that are at ours currently will move on in the summer if we dont go up - smith and nolan and also taylor etc.  they will all leave and rightly so. So, obviously they will be replaced with total shit players as thats ashleys plan anyway. \r\n\r\nAs for this actual blog topic - i would like to see us get vinnie jones and get him to kick the shit out of ashley."
