message: "Very much doubt any signings other than loans will take place.\r\nApparently there has been some confusion as to where the allocation of the 20m. will go. (day to day operation)\r\nSo in case any hopes are raised, fugedaboudit !\r\nYes it`s unfortunate and short sighted, the main goal should be to gain promotion, that`s where the money is, there`s little revenue to be had in this league and the longer we stay here the more difficult promotion will become.\r\nThe one thing MA said that you can take to the bank is, in admitting he is no footballing expert.\r\nI would like to know in that case, from where does he get his advice ?\r\nHopefully not from Llambias, the blind leading the blind."
