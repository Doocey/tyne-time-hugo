  No I don't think we have overreacted. I personally don't think he would have
  kept us up. He had a 22.22% win ratio one of the worst in the clubs history
  and given the state of the morale of the players by the time Shearer took over
  I don't think he would have done any better. I also think his PR is horrendous
  and how can he cancel the transfer of Douglas at the last min because 'he
  never heard of him' that almost cost the club Graham Carr which would have
  been a disaster. He has a total disregard for the fans and so far seems out of
  touch with the modern game. Time will tell but so far it isn't looking good. I
  agree with you in regards to Ashley though I am surprised that people are so
  quick to praise him in regards to the current state of the club saying we are
  on a sound financial footing when we are in more debt than when he initially
  took over the club!!
