  I guess portsmouth in there current financial state are just glad to get rid
  of another wage of the bill at least we can aybe pay him on time. Netherless
  we were also after him at the same time as portsmouth but of course MA wasnt
  forthcoming with funds and we lost out all i can say any player coming in is
  better than none as the squad as a whole is still thin compared to many and
  should we get promotion which i guess we will, can you really see us buying
  big in the future. the simpson williamson? and a couple of other signings
  wages will be paid by the geremi sale to turkey on his 58k a week wages so the
  wage bill will not increase and for 3 or 4 new faces is a good bit of business
  for hughton
