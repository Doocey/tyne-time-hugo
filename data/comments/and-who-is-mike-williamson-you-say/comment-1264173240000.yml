message: "I watched Willo play week in week out for Wycombe and he was a class player. He was of better quality then Roger Johnson when he was at the club, and now see where Roger is.\r\n\r\nWillo will be great cover for Taylor and Collo and could be used against large strong forwards for his aerial ability.\r\n\r\nA great signing if this happens, all we need now is another RB, a forward with pace and power and a midfielder to replace Butt and we will be sorted."
