message: "Only know bits and pieces about the lad.\r\n\r\nNot sure if he was at Wycombe when Steven Taylor was there, but Williamson blossomed under Tony Adams and moved to Watford.\r\n\r\nNot seen much of him at Watford, but do remember the Watford side he was in played good football and regularly challenged the CCC league. My mate is a Watford fan and remember last year asking about him when we were linked and he told me he was very decent and one of the better CCC defenders, didnt want to lose him.\r\n\r\nLike everything else, time will tell."
