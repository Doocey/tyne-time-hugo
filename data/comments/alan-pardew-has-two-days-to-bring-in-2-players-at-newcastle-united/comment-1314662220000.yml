message: "I'd love a top class striker too - but... hold on\_ minute...\n\n1) We're not in either the champions league or even the Europa league this season - so we don't have the pull of offering European football (nor the income it brings).\n\n2) We're in our second season after coming back up from the championship, and didn't make the top ten last season.\n\n3) Our owner is tight - and wants to tun the club on a tight budget - so we won't offer 'high' wages or big transfer fees.\n\n1) + 2) mean we have no chance of signing well-known top strikers as many seem to expect we should/can.\n\n3) just compounds this.\n\nWe will either get a potentially great young striker or nowt. Just thank god I can't add an over the hill 'big' name on crazy wages (Owen, Viduka, Klivert etc.) to the list anymore.\n\nWe need to be realistic. I don't like it either - but that's where we are right now..."
