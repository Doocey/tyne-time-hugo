  You are probably right, but the strikers we have a the moment just aren't good
  enough if we want to finish in the top half of the table.


  It's ironic that although our defence is pretty solid for once, but we are
  likely to struggle because we don't have decent forwards who can hold on to
  the ball and score goals.
