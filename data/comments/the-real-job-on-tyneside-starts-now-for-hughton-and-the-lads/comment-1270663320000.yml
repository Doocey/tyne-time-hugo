message: "There`s going to be a lot of speculation as to both the amount of available dosh and who it will be spent on.\r\nFrom now on you will hear about so many players we should be signing, many that perhaps few have heard of, but fit the requirements, cheap and not over twenty six.\r\nA requirement which IMO is ridiculess, every team needs a certain amount of seasoned players, to set standards based solely on age is nonsense.\r\nDoubt if we will spend much over ten million, could be a gamble, but then if things go brown, we can spend during the winter window.\r\nThe program appears to be get a couple of decent players in, to survive the first season back, then build year by year by adding and selling.\r\nCertainly not a bad policy, it`s just the age limit that bothers me, we would never have signed such players as Pedro, Ginola, Robert, Speed, Sir Les.,Lee etc. had that policy been in effect. \r\nMost athletes reach their prime @ about twenty seven or eight and depending on fitness and lifestyle play their best football up untill early thirties.\r\nBut hey! what do i know ?"
