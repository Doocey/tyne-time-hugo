message: "I think it will be £25m max – some reports are saying as little as £15m (but nobody really knows, so these figures are probably all just random guesses if we’re being honest).  AussieToon says that Hughton has done well in the transfer market so far.  What does everyone else think? Doocey, perhaps a separate thread for us to debate this?  I was initially quite pleased with the January signings in particular, and especially as there was little money to spend.  Then I thought about it a bit more.  Here are my conclusions on our 2009/10 signings:-\r\n\r\nSimpson – did an OK job this season but will struggle in the PL.  \r\n\r\nLovenkrands – a very good signing (well, re-signing, so not sure if Hughton gets all of the credit for that one!).  In my opinion our best striker and will probably do reasonably well next season.  \r\n\r\nPancrate – one or two decent performances but not good enough for the PL, barely good enough for the Championship.  Will almost certainly leave in the summer.  \r\n\r\nRoutledge – has done very well so far and although it’s still early days, seems a good signing, potentially a bargain.  A bit concerned about whether he can maintain form and fitness over a sustained period of time, given the number of clubs he has had for a relatively young player.  \r\n\r\nWilliamson – so far so good.  Another potential bargain.  \r\n\r\nBest – an absolutely disastrous signing.  Not even good enough for the Championship, so has no chance of cutting it in the PL.  \r\n\r\nSo a bit of a mixed bag, in my opinion."
