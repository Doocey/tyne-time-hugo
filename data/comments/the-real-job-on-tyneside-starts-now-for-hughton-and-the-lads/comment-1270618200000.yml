message: "I think if we do get the rumored Â£25m or so it will put us in good stead for the Premier League.By no means should fans expect any European action, I think Safety would be goal with mid table security an awesome achievement in the first season.\r\n\r\nJaime O'Hara would be a good addition. \r\nAlan Hutton also would bolster our defence.\r\n\r\nWho else can we get?\r\n\r\nThe one thing is Chris Hughton has proved very good in the transfer market so having those type of funds will go a long way for us."
