message: "I honestly believe that four quality signings rather than 5 or 6 average players will see us do very well in the PL next season.\r\n\r\nThe big thing for me is that we bring in players with PL experience and not take to many chances;\r\n\r\nOuts; \r\n\r\nLeon Best (nothing short of woeful; we need 5 strikers in PL; Ameobi, Carroll, lovenkrands, ranger + 1 new addition)\r\n\r\nNicky butt - out of contract\r\n\r\nPancrate - out of contract\r\n\r\nAlan Smith - to slow for the PL + on big money ( we need a creative pacey central midfielder)\r\n\r\nIns;\r\n\r\nCurtis Davies - 4/5 million (Not getting a sniff at villa)\r\n\r\nJamie O-hara - 4/5 million\r\n\r\nCarlos Vela - Season long loan ( i'm convinced this lad will score goals in the PL; a real talent with plenty of pace)\r\n\r\nJoe Ledley - Free transfer (out of contract at end of season; has had injury troubles but still only around 25 and has plenty of skill and ability; the one of my signings who has not played PL football yet)"
