  Mike Ashley has to be a realist, and he will have to sell at the rate of
  recession. 70.000.000is good, and if he can get an extra 15, say 85....and
  10...more if Newcastle climb from the Championship.  Newcastle have only won a
  second div title, Michael Owen scores for Man-U, but not for the Magpies, very
  sad.
