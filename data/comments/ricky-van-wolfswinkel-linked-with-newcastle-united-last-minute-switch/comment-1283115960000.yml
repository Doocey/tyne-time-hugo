  Of course it's a big step up for the player, so no hard feelings if this deal
  goes through. I'd be glad to see him go to a club with a grand tradition and
  great supporters tbh. We won't be able to hang onto him in the long run anyway
  unfortunately.


  And if you really want to rip our hearts out: have a look at Dries Mertens.
  Easily one of the best players in the Eredivisie, young, and improving each
  week...
