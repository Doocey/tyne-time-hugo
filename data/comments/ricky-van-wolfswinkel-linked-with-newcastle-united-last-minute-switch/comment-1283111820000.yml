  I prefer this feller to the aging Keane.

  One link on the net saying Keane would prefer Newcastle where he would be
  "guaranteed" first team football rather than Villa - eh ?

  NOBODY should be "guaranteed" anything. Least of all a feller at the twilight
  of his career.

  I like Keane. But would prefer an up and coming FAST and YOUNG prospect.
