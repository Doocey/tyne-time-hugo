  Utrecht fan over here... We'd be gutted if you take him off our hands. He's
  one of the most talented forwards over here and has the right mentality. I do
  think he's a little lightweight for the EPL though. He'd need to buff up and
  will only be showing you what he's capable of later in the season. The Utrecht
  owner is a selfmade millionaire with a will of his own though. He doesn't need
  the money. Only if the player wants to leave himself will he be allowed too.
  This being the first season he's really the undisputed #1 forward, I doubt
  whether he'll deem himself ready and willing.
