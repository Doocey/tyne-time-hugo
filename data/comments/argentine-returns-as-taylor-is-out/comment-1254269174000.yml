  Well Phil, how's things?

  I'm not sure whether Jonas will start the game but I'd expect him to make some
  impact. Geremi could play RM I think, that or Guthrie, or indeed Guthrie
  switching to CM. Who knows.

  Geremi can cross the ball for sure so he's an asset when he wants to be.

  Ranger might be given a rest, and Lovenkrands might start upfront alongside
  Andy.

  Honestly don't know though, it's a pretty strong looking team as is.
