message: "You really don't have much of a clue about blackburn rovers, Nzonzi is young and strong but his striking of the ball couldn't be much worse. People remember a goal he scored against everton which was one in a million of his attempts from that distance. However he does have great potential and will not be providing BACK UP for anyone next year. Pedersen would be lucky \_to get into any other side in the top 3 english divisions, decent left foot which of late has deserted him and he has zero else going for him, slowest player in the football league. If we lost pedersen on a free I would have a party, he's worse than jason roberts!! About time this idea of him being one of our better players disappeared, we have been applauding his removal from games for a full season, people don't seem to have picked up on this yet."
