  in the article the Manager of Tasci is saying that he is currently not
  interested to move to Tottenham or Newcastle, because it is no improvement to
  his current club VfB Stuttgart, as Stuttgart as well as Newcastle and
  Tottenham play in the Europe League next season and that he only would be
  interested in offers from clubs who are playing in the Champions League next
  season. He also says that Tasci has a clause in his contract like Demba Ba.
