  The first paragraph is about the fact that he's due back for pre-season
  training with Stuttgart on July 2nd and working on his recovery from injury
  without a summer break. The key part is here:


  " The English Premier League Clubs Tottenham and Newcastle want to sign him. '
  We're aware of the interest' said Tasci's representative, Uli Ferber, though
  he immediately added 'we're really not considering it at all'.


  It claims he'd only consider a move if it guaranteed a more prestigious and
  better level of European competition, and since Stuttgart are also in the
  Europe League, neither we nor Spurs can offer that. He'd only move to a
  Champions League club. It adds that he could theoretically leave for a foreign
  (non-German) club for a fixed amount via a release clause in his contract,
  which in any case runs to 2014. 


  The overall tone is that he's not that keen to move, and even if he was, he
  wouldn't come to us.
