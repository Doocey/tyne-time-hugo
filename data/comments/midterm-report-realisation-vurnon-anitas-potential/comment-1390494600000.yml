  Spot on article Vernon is a very important part in our midfield and if he can
  hold his own among Tiote, Cabaye, Sissoko and Goufran is a sign of a good
  player, when you include Ben Arfa to the above five you realise what midfield
  we have got, no wonder that Bigirimana, Gosling, Sammy and Vuckic all
  considered reasonable premier league squad members cannot get a sniff.

  Long may continue and if Cabaye goes as predicted in the Summer I am sure Carr
  has already his replacement in mind.

  My main concern is the front line, Remy is not certain will be there next
  year, Cisse if he stays has to improve a lot and he has to learn the offside
  rules, Shola has proved that cannot play to the standard of the present team,
  and a number of up coming youngsters will not be ready to lead the front line,
  so De Jong must be a solution and undre the present circumstances at Blackpool
  young Ince could be persuaded to joint us.
