  I agree BEN10 is a world class player BUT...he really needs to play it easy
  sometimes. He thinks everytime he gets the ball he needs to attack or score,he
  gets caught with the ball in dangerous areas and finds it hard to play the
  short easy pass. He has all the flair you can wish for but must learn that the
  game is about a team not a individual.I think Tottenham went 26 games without
  winning when they played Gareth Bale but then Bale changed the way he played
  and become more of a team player. I believe BEN10 can become a better player
  than Bale but he must learn and adapt to our style of play and do the dirty
  work as well.The 5 yard pass can be just as effective as a 40 yard pass if
  used correctly. "BEN..if we have the ball they cant score"
