  I would avoid using Santon and Ben Arfa on the same side, who would defend? It
  would also unbalance the side a bit ... with all our attacking wing play
  coming from the right. I would play Raylor at RB and Santon at LB. Raylor
  would provide Ben Arfa with better defensive cover and doesn't need to take
  players on to be threatening, he's probably the best crosser of the ball in
  the team as well. Also, playing on the right he wouldn't have to keep cutting
  back to cross the ball in on his right foot! 


  Besides, Jonas compliments Santon quite well too, and offers alot of cover for
  when he's attacking.
