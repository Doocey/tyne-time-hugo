message: "Sorry...For me he is exactly the wrong type of player for newcastle united. Ive seen him in the home games against QPR (as a sub) and then starting against Bristol City &amp; Doncaster. On top of that his start against Forrest was televised. The lad is a million miles behind Young Nile Ranger and other than his goal against QPR has been completely ineffective!\r\n\r\nHe doesnt chase down defenders like Nile or Carroll. He has missed good chances (a sitter for me in the opening minutes agianst Bristol city)...How much time do we give him? Is 3 substitue appearances and three starts not enough to prove that he isnt up to task?\r\n\r\nthe championship is purely and simply a results business for us this season. The facts show that we have won one in 5. Harewood has started 3 of those games and added nothing. Ranger deserves a run of three games coming up to show us what he had already began to show at the beginning of the season.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in booing players at St. James (...ok ive done it a couple of times when Geremi has sluggishly waddled of the pitch after having been missing for his entirety of his happening to be on it....) but surely the fans can see that starting harewood is not in the best intersts of the team and results. \r\n\r\nIn fact the only times he's actually looked ok was in his sub appearances aginst ipswich and qpr. Let's use him from the bench if need be...but as a starter?????? Absolutely not."
