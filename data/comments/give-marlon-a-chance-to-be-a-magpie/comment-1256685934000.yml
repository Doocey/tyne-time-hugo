message: "Harewood and Carroll do not work together but I'm not entirely sure why Harewood is getting all the flak. Carroll was awfull until his goal on Saturday and it could quite easily have been him that should have been subbed. Nile Ranger came on and the game changed but I'm not convinced that was purely down to Harewood being taken off.\r\n\r\nI'd still like to see Harewood and Ranger given a chance up front because I honstly believe that Carroll offers very little and is so slow at times it's unbelievable\r\n\r\nI'd say on paper Harewood has the most goals in him out of all our strikers but playing him alongside Carroll and booing him isn't going to do anybody any favours"
