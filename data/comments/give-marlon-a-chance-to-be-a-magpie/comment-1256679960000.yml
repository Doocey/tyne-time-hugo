message: "saturdays booing i think was a combination. harewood hadnt looked good enough or even interested from the start. also it was clear a change needed to made much earlier than it was, and equaly clear that the change needed to be harewood for ranger. maybe it is a bit harsh to boo the lad but if hughton thinks hes the best we have maybe the booing needs to directed there.\r\nto start carroll and harewood was clearly not the right decision and the fact hughton did this (again) simply confrims that he is not the man for the job full time."
