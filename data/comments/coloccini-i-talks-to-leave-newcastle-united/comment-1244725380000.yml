  When he eventually got here after NO pre-season he looked a quality player in
  the first 3 or so games. then. Keegan left houghton in charge the club was for
  sale, no it was'nt Kinnear the clown in, then he almost snuffs it the houghton
  again then its Shearer then were back up for sale. No wonder half the team
  were lost on the pitch. How would we be if our place of work was in such
  disarray.
