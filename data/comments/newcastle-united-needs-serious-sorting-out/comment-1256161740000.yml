  Mike Ashley bought a football club that had a realistic chance of challenging
  for europe. He somehow turned us into a championship outfit. Appointing Chris
  Hughton full time confirms just what we are. At best a good championship side
  that may be promoted but would then scrap for survival like Hull Wolves etc.
  If he stays it will be a disaster and as fans we must let a voices be heard.
  Forget about other fans saying we expect too much. I dont give a toss about
  thier clubs they shouldnt about ours. Oh &amp; how on earth has Ashley's
  appointed investment group failed to find 1 single genuine buyer. Are we
  really going to sit back and keep taking this.
