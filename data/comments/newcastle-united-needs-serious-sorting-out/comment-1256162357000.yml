  not only does ashley need to go but so does geremi! why keep playing him cant
  anyone see how rubbish he is! was at the games on saturday and tuesday and we
  seemed to lack organisation and team spirit, we argued with each other we
  lacked the spirit to win both games.  we are better than this lads come on we
  need to be back in the premiership we belong there playing like we did in our
  last two games isnt gonna get us there! jonas was an inspiration, alan smith
  another great performance and kevin nolans goal was 2nd to non x
