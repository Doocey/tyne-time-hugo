message: "Been saying that forever.\r\nA ship adrift, a know nowt owner and a know even less general manager, the blind leading the blind.\r\nIf i were Hughton I would think twice before accepting the poison chalice on offer.\r\nFace it ,the club has become a joke, chaos reigns, with most self respecting managers giving us a wide berth.\r\nFraid there will be more of the same until the club changes hands.\r\nNot that I am in any way advocating a takeover by Moat, no more than another Freddy in my opinion.\r\nOur only hope is a takeover by big money and for a second tier team in the middle of the worst financial climate since the great depression, that seems unlikely.\r\nWere Ashley to spend some money to ensure promotion, it would certainly be in his interest, selling a PL team is easier and would bring a better price than one bogged down in the fizzy.\r\nI cant believe that option has escaped him.\r\nGuess we will have to hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
