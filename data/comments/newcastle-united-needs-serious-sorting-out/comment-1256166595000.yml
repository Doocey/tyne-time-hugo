  Everyone agrees Ashley is a disaster. Everyone agrees where he will take us
  (1991 again). We need to shout long and loud. He hates it, when we
  demonsttated against Hull last season he threw he towel and put the club up
  for sale. When he took the club off the market he appointed Shearer to divert
  the fans attention (that was his motive I assure you). He's now sneaked in the
  back door thinking we all content being top of the league (or second as it is
  now). He was on the ropes and we must put him back. We must turn the heat up
  so this man walks (not hope for the best prepare for the worst). This club
  means the world to me and has since the early 1970's. Starting with Docaster
  on Saturday we should shout this man out of town. We can do it. Public
  pressure is all we have left.
