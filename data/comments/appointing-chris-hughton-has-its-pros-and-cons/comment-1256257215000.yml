message: "Curbishley or Coppell, surely that`s tongue in cheek, you could`nt possibly be serious.\r\nPerhaps most fans do not understand the situation.\r\nIt would cost money to hire a manager.\r\nAshley , though desperately wanting out, is not about to either spend or give the club away.\r\nThe result will consist of hopefully gaining promotion, with either the present playing staff or supplemented by further loaned players. \r\nDepending on where the club is at come Christmas, certain decisions will have to be made, it may be necessary to buy in order to gain promotion, but only if the club is slipping and appears likely to miss out.\r\nIt will take a lot before Ashley puts his hand into his pocket.\r\nThough I doubt if he will sell anyone, as much as he would like to, last seasons mistakes hopefully will not be repeated.\r\nNot a lot to look forward too.\r\nAs far as looking at people to bring in, just paper talk and agents getting publicity for their clients,pay no attention."
