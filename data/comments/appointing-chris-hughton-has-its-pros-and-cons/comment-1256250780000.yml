  There's no doubt that Hughton has done a great job but now the wheels are
  coming off as the championship begin to find us out. When has a caretaker
  manager ever done well when becoming permanent? Let's just say Chris gets us
  promoted, this will mean he will be manager in the Premier League and we all
  know how bad that was last year. I think we should go for an experienced
  manager like Curbushley or Coppell. This is just Ashley putting another two
  fingers up at the fans
