  I agree with Mickarious when he says Fat Ash has never had any intention of
  selling the club. I said at the time of the club being out back on the market
  that he would wait until after the transfer window, take the club off the
  market and appoint Hughton as manager. Let's face it businessmen such as
  Ashley do not accept Â£130 million losses on any investment. He's suckered us
  twice and again shows his utter contempt towards the very people who keep our
  club afloat, the Geordie faithful!
