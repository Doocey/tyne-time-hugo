message: "Hughton has done a pretty decent job in keeping the dressing room, steadying the ship so to speak, keeping everyone in check BUT 2 draws at home to Bristol City and QPR followed by 2 deafeats at Notts forest and Scunny is not good.\r\n\r\nLets be clear tho, Ashley has no desire to sell the club at all. never mind any of the bullshit we read.  Hughton is a the cheapest option for him, he'll keep the same coaching staff etc.  A new manager brings in a new contract, new staff and all sorts.\r\n\r\nThis fella wants to see if he can recoup anything.  Its his money, he can do what the hell he likes - whether we like it or not.  You buys the goods, you decide how to treat em."
