  It's a shame Hughton's getting the job, would of loved to have seen Coppell,
  Curbishley or Irvine get the job. But as Chuck said simply was never ever
  going to happen, Hughton has been lucky this season and thinking of the
  position of Hughton getting the job now I wish he wasn't. We've only played 2
  good games this season Ipswich &amp; Reading and they both played absolutley
  terrible, it's just been luck that has won us games this season as its
  starting to show as of the past 4 games. I don't think we'll get a result on
  Saturday, Hughton's tactics and team selections are the worst things I've seen
  since Chernobyl, he has no clue what so ever a toddler could pick a better
  team than Hughton. To be honest I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if we
  did a Leeds, we maybe top 2 but after the past 4 games we won't be for long.
