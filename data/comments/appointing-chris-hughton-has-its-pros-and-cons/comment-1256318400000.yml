  He didn't give Shearer the job because Al told him straight who he wanted in
  and who he wanted out of the squad no messing about Al wasn't going to be a
  yes man to Ashley his approach was ''i'll be the manger if you'll let me
  manage the club'' now i know a lot of people will say well were 2nd in the
  league etc and Hughton hasn't done a bad job but we all know a defeat against
  Doncaster tomorrow will be a defeat too many there was trouble in the crowd
  after the Scunthorpe defeat midweek i just hope there's no repeat tomorrow if
  the result doesn't go our way
