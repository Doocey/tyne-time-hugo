  Extremely pleased with this window. The signing of Ben Arfa is amazing. This
  guy has the same amount of talent as C.Ronaldo the only thing lacking is
  consistency from the lad. I believe this is the transfer of the decade for
  Newcastle and I for one can't wait for Blackpool to see Ben Arfa cause them
  all sorts of problems. I was gutted about Arsharvin moving to Arsenal 2
  seasons ago but this player is just as good. Hughton can tame his nasty
  attitude and he will keep faith in a player that is desperate for recognition
  and e3ager to impress.
