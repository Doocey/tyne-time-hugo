  The fact he is at Bayern is about reason 1,000,043 that he wouldn&#39;t come
  to our club mate. Why would the Golden boot winning, young player of the World
  Cup tournament come to a newly promoted Premier league club which is about a
  million miles away from the Champions league or winning any other trophy in
  our present condition? I definitely aint a doom-monger but I am a realist.
