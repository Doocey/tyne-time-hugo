  I agree we do need another striker and Dos Santos would be a great signing. We
  honestly can&#39;t depend on Ameobi, Lovenkrands, Carrol to get at least 15-20
  goals between them to keep us up, it isn&#39;t the Championship and their
  quality will be matched by experienced Premier League defenders. Overall, I
  don&#39;t care who we get but a striker is a MUST. And it must be a striker
  who&#39;s at a decent height and is pacy.
