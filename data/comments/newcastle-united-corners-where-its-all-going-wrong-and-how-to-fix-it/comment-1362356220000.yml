message: "I may be a few out, but my\_reckoning\_has it at 303 corners since we last scored from one, the basic\_strategy\_appears to be gets into the box and hope it works out, this is where the Maanager and the coaches come in, looking at what we have and what the opposition are likely to have, then working out a number of alternatives, we have some good strikers of the ball from the edge of the box bu that is never used as an option. Even some of the lower league teams come up with something novel, \_we seem t come up with the same tactic all the time, are those taking them under instructions or have they no right to determine the tactic."
