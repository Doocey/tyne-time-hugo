message: "I like corners to the back stick as well as long as the delivery is good enough to get above the keeper then dip down fast enough to get on the head of an oncoming striker etc... Also the knock back across can be effective if it is a well worked routine where everyone \_knows there roles and can move into position before the defender can anticipate there movement. For me the set pieces should all be about the delivery and movement. I think our corner takers should focus more on putting a ball in an area rather than hitting a person directly. If you put the ball in a dangerous area as far as I am concerned it is the attackers job to get on the end of it. And \_from a movement perspective as much as I don't like the guy Michael Owen used to score plenty of headers for us and he is smaller than 6 ft. He did this because of his movement. To me these are the two vital things we miss out on with our corners. Our corners are too predictable aiming for Williamson when he was in the team or Steven Taylor now. We need to be a bit more creative and change it up."
