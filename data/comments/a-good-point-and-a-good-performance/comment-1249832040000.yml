  Its a shame Big Al wasnt on the pitch as he would have had the game over and
  won by half time we need someone to stick the ball in the net it's all very
  well having all the possesion but if we dont put the ball in the net we wont
  win games if we'd taken all the chances we would have come away with 3 points
  as it was we struggled to get a point some great work by Krull saved us from
  coming away with nothing
