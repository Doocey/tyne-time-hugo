  Well what can i say who could have predicted this ? 5 wins and a draw a great
  result for the lads i just hope they can keep it going obviously its to early
  to talk about promotion but against all the odds and amidst all the turmoil
  the lads and Chris Hughton &amp; Co have rolled their sleeves up and got stuck
  in were it really matters on the pitch ''Howay The Lads''
