  The glory days are set to return. An insider close to Mike Ashley has told me
  Mike is desperate to invest in the squad after what he saw on Wednesday. He
  has adopted the policy of the Arabs and will purchase backbone players over
  the weekend - and I mean numbers! Nolan is the first to come, watch out for
  more. I am informed Newcastle have made official bids for Joleon Lescott, Mark
  Noble, Elano and Fabio Aurelio. This is to be followed by a second round of
  spending spree in the summer should we survive.


  Those bids are official, but none of them have had any reply as of now. Watch
  out in the Chronicle for future development!
