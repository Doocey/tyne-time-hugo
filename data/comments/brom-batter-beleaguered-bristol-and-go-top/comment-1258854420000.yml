message: "Yeah West Brom. appear to be the team to give the strongest challenge to the Toon, but Cardiff are also pushing hard as are their countrymen Swansea (how long is it since either one was in the top flight ?)\r\nLeicester are also challenging on equal points.\r\nWhat has happened too the smoggies seem to be falling well off the pace, too bad, had hoped they along with the Toon would gain promotion. \r\nWatched The mackems beat a lackluster Arsenal team to-day, though the Mackems may have had something to do with it.\r\nLooks like we may have missed out on not hiring Bruce, doing a good job at the Wearside club."
