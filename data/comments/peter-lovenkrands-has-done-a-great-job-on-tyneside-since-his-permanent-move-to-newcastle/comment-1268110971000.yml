  Don't agree that the winter x-fer signings 'in a way sent us down'. Any and
  all players were struggling to get anywhere near their best, such was the
  toxic atmosphere - plus absence of a manager by rights. It was unimportant who
  came - we had a squad which should have been getting uefa not relegated,, but
  as we have seen this season - a little bit of coherence and stability goes
  along way to getting players back on song.
