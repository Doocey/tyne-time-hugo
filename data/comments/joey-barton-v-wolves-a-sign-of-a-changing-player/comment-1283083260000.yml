  Stop looking for excuses to cloud your disappointment. It's a well known fact
  that Toon fans are among the most arrogant in the country. After that 6-0
  drubbing  last week you all expected to saunter into Molineux and take 3
  points out of the midlands again. Because you didn't, you find it easier to
  say that we 'targeted' Joey Barton. Get a grip and pull your head out your
  arse - yesterday was a classic display of the 'Joey Barton Protection Scheme'
  - so much as breath on him and you'll be booked. 


  Oh, by the way, were you getting a pie when Jarvis was brought down in the box
  for what should have been a stonewall penalty? Swings and roundabouts.
