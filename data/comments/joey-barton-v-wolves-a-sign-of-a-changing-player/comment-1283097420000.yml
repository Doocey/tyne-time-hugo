  You might want to read the article fully before you comment. 

  I said Matt Jarvis should have had a penalty, clearly and not one Newcastle
  United fan said we were going to win it for definite yesterday. Although we
  should have in all fairness, we had all the chances worth talking about.


  Regards Barton, it's so obvious you targeted Barton and tried to get him to
  react, it didn't work though did it? No, and he ended up plugging away at his
  job in centre-mid and inevitably was a major factor in our much deserved
  equaliser.


  I'll agree with you regards the arrogance statement - there are a small
  proportion of Toon fans that think they should be in the Champions League &
  Europe but I'd like to emphasise the word "proportion", as they're in
  minority. If you ask any sane Newcastle fan, they'll take 17th spot right here
  right now.


  Back to Barton for one sec, maybe I missed it, but I think there was only one
  yellow card issued for tackles on him? Anyway, make sure you read an article
  fully before commenting in such a brute fashion, all in all, you know Wolves
  were lucky to have got a point out of that game.
