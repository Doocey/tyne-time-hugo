  to be honest we dont deserve our place in the premiership after the joke of
  the season we've had. at least the teams around us are putting up a fight but
  our lot just dont seem to give 2 shits, but what do they care they'll get a
  move to another team in the premiership and still get paid Â£60k a week while
  we have to go and watch us play blackpool etc. thanks guys.
