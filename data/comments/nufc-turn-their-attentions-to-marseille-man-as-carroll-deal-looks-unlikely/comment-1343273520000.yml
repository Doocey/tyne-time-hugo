message: "I think if we are willing to pay 15m for Carroll then then this one should be a no brainer. Despite the concerns over a heart condition after his move to\_Montpelier, he has really justified their investment in him. Above all else I agree that Loic would be a much smoother fit than Andy.\_I honestly believe that if we can somehow bring this lad in, get Debuchy over the line too and hopefully a center back to improve on Willo, we will have a squad that should be actually competing for the top four on paper. Ashley has made the right decisions so far and I have little to complain about overall, but I honestly hope he does the right thing here and pushes the boat out, just a little to bring these guys in. Quickly. \_"
