message: "I think Colo is one of our better players, but whether he was worth £10m plus £60k per week in wages (some reports even say £80k) is another matter.  He's just turned 28, which certainly isn't too old for a centre half (although I do agree that he's not the quickest), and I'm sure he wouldn't have 30 caps for Argentina if he was rubbish.  \r\n\r\nI don't think we should underestimate just how difficult it is for foreign players to adapt to playing in a new team in a new league, and living in an unfamiliar country with an unfamiliar culture – especially when you don’t even speak the language.  And it must be especially difficult for a centre half coming into the famously shambolic Newcastle defence, amidst everything else that was going on at the club last season as well.  We all know that there have been plenty of big name foreign players who have struggled in the Premiership (Veron, Shevchenko, Luque etc.), or at least taken time to settle.  Taking all of this into account, I actually think Colo did reasonably well for us last season.  I’ve often wondered, do NUFC do anything to help a new player to settle?  Does the club offer support with, for example, finding a house, getting language lessons, getting the kids into a good school, helping the family to settle etc?  I suspect that we probably don’t do anything close to enough.  With all these things up in the air, it shouldn’t be a surprise that players struggle to find their best form immediately upon arrival.  We have to remember that these guys are only human – just because they earn a lot of money, it doesn’t mean they can automatically take all of these things in their stride.  It’s bound to affect their performance, at least in the first instance.  \r\n\r\nI think that overall, I more or less agree with sentiment of the article – if a big offer comes in, the likelihood is that we’ll sell and I probably wouldn’t object.  But not because Colo hasn’t performed well; more because the huge wages we’ve paid in the past have come more into perspective now that we've been relegated and many of the other big earners have gone.  I’ve heard it suggested that relegation might have been just what NUFC needed – a chance to clear out some dead wood and bring the wage bill under control, then return to the Premiership in a much more healthy state.  The “one step back” needed in order to allow us to take two steps forward.  I think that this view may well have some credibility, and the selling of Colo certainly wouldn’t be inconsistent with that philosophy."
