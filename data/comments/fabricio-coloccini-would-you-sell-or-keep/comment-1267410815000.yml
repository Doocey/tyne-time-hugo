  Easy to say that but he has experience and there are any number of imports
  that fail to cut the mustard in the premier league during their first season.
  Thiery Henry was rubbish first time out. Vidic looks really poor too. The step
  back up will be a huge problem for us and we will need at least 8 new first
  teamers to do well. We won't get that and will come down again next season and
  be the new West Brom I fear. Hope I'm wrong. Players like Smith have looked
  good in this division !!! If we were in the Prem with the current crop we
  would be in the bottom 3 for sure. Yes, our youngsters will be a year bigger
  and stronger but I'm afraid we have a team full of prem squad players at best.
  Our only chance is to get a new owner in place by May and a new manager.
  Hughton has done great but we are in denial in terms of the tactics and
  quality for the prem
