  So some of you geniuses think that Curly is not good enough for the Toon,
  despite the fact that the rest of the world think he is good enough to play
  for potential world champions Argentina? My judgement is the current lot would
  be good enough for mid table in EPL. Which let me remind you is where Brum,
  Fulham, Blackburn, Bolton, Wigan and Stoke are. They are the teams we will
  have to beat not Chelsea.
