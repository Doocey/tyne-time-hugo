message: "Alot of over seas players need time to settle in the prem, I'd definately keep him as he's one of a few top class players on the books at NUFC, his wage however might prove a problem.\r\n\r\nOthers imo to leave before him on high £60k plus wages are maybe Butt, Smith and Barton? I don't agree totally with a wage cap of £30K, I just don't think it'll be enough for the quality of player needed at SJP. We'll just end up as a feeder club for others."
