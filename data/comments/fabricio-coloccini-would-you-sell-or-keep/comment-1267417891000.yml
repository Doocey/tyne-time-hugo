message: "Coloccini needed 1 season to adapt as a foreigner to English football. Just look at him now, he is easily one of our very best players, and we must keep him if we go up.\r\n\r\nHe was class yesterday and has been many times this season.\r\n\r\nAs for Last season, Colocini played 6 bad games out 36. those 6 games just got highlighted because he made a couple of mistakes that led to goals, and him being scapegoated. His other 30 games for us were not bad at all, they were quite composed performances yet not top class. \r\n\r\nColocinni is Premier League quality and he will prove it next season."
