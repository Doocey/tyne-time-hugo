  Had felt a bit of sympathy for Pardew till yesterday ---- its obvious he has
  lost the dressing room, also lost the fans some time ago by constantly
  defending poor decisions by the Ashley regime. Time to go but its a big
  concern as to who Ashley will replace him with - Wise, Kinnear bloody hell. I
  hope for once they actually put some thought into the appointment. Does anyone
  really want Bruce as manager - can remember not so long ago what he used to
  get called and now so called fans want him ? Show some ambition Frand de Boer
  and his staff get rid of our coaches - only ones that appear to be any good is
  A.Woodman and P.Beardsley.
