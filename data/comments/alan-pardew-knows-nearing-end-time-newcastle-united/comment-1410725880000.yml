  I think Ashley is mad enough to bring Kinnear out of mothballs again!

  You could then see a scenario unfold in front of the Sky cameras where a Jock
  Stein like episode would happen with Kinnear ending up having a heart attack
  in front of everyone!

  That's how much of a mad man Ashley is and i wouldn't put it past him!
