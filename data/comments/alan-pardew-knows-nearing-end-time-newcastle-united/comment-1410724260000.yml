  Noody knows what Ashley is planning so all the reports are hype generated by
  reporters in the dark. Touting different managers in the media is pointless
  because Ashley always does things left field. Did anyone predict Pardew
  getting the job. I am sure there are plenty who could do the job better but I
  don't trust Ashley to do the right thing and regardless we are still missing a
  goal scorer and centre half.
