  The problem we have is that the press always say we want fight and grit.

  When what we really want is a technique based manager who values flair,
  creativity and and a cavalier approach to attacking football.

  The ironic thing is that Ashley's vision will only work if a manager of that
  ilk arrives.


  For us to become successful and work within our means it means we have to
  utilise players in a way which will improve our players abilities.  That means
  playing them to their strengths.


  Some managers, although good managers, will focus on a defensive system.  They
  believe that the system will bail out players weaknesses and a point or win is
  still obtainable.


  What actually happens though is that the players don't do themselves justice
  and very few will improve.


  Cabella is the perfect example of this.  Any French guy would tell you that
  defensively Cabella is at his weakest.  Yet which player has made the most
  tackles for the toon?


  A technique based manager though, constantly changes his system to suit his
  players.  Those players get better and better because they are played to their
  strengths.  Training is designed to improve them and get the best out of them.


  Arsenal are great at this and Keegan was too.  


  A good way to compare the systems is to look at Ginola and Ben Arfa.


  Ben Arfa ended up on a free transfer and yet Ginola was sold.


  To bring the best out of players you also need a manager who has had success.


  Once your good players have turned into great ones you don't want them to
  leave.


  This is only achievable if they believe a manager can bring them success. 
  Employing a manager who has won titles and cups is the perfect remedy for
  this.
