  Agreed - Ashley is utterly unpredictable at the best of times, but I do
  believe Alan Pardew was actually the bookies favourites throughout the period
  after we sacked Hughton, could be wrong about that.


  But yeah, we do lack a goal-scoring threat, and a solid centre-back. However,
  I do think a better manager would set the team up a tad better, and in time,
  help Ciss√© come back stronger.
