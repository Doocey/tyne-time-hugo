  I'm in a similar boat, but I lost all support for AP a few months back and now
  I just want him gone.


  I would pray that it won't be Joe Kinnear (if Pardew is shown the door), and I
  somehow doubt it will considering his failures in the position of DoF.


  I actually would take Bruce no problem, but de Boer would be the dream.
  Unlikely club will want to pay compensation for a new manager if it comes to
  it, mind.



  For that reason - David Moyes or Tony Pulis would be leading contenders.
