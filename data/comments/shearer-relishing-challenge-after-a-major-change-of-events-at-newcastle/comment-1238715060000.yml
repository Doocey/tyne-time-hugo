  Haha.

  See the reason why people don't comment is because they visit the main page,
  read the article and don't bother going into it and leaving a comment. I get
  on average 100 views a day but all on the homepage. Soon enough I'll be in the
  Worlds biggest Football news directory and when I post a new article on this
  site it will come up on the latest news, resulting in people viewing the
  article rather than the homepage, ie. leaving comments :)
