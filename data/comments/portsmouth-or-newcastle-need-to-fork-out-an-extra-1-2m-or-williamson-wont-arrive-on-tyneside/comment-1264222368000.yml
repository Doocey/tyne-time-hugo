  We nice to see there we as fans are clutching at straws and have no idea what
  so ever is gannin on in this deal. And if it's 1.2million they owe to Watford
  then if we give them another 200k then Pompey would be giving him to us for
  nowt, AINT EVER gonna happen they will want something out of it to pay off
  thier debts.
