  I think you are a little muddled up here. WE've had a 1M bid accepted, but
  Portsmouth still owe Norwich 1.2M. Therefore the extra cash needed to be
  forked out is Â£200,000. And thats what they probably want us to pay. but even
  if they turned us down for not paying the extra 200k it would make no sense,
  as if they accept it then they only owe 200k, turn us down they still owe 1.2M
