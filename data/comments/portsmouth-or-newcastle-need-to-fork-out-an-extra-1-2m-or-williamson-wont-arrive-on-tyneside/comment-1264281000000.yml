  I wonder how many weeks wages portsmouth would have to pay to make up the same
  amount of the extra 200k they need to pay watford. if williamson doesnt go in
  the window then they will have to keep paying the remainder of this seasons
  wages plus still the 1.2m they owe watford which in long term will work out a
  much more expensive option for psmouth
