message: "Cant see how it affects us what they own Watford. Either way they have to pay 1.2 million and if they want a million pound to help pay that (for a player they cant afford to play) they should accept the deal.\r\n\r\nIMO they knew about the situation and thought they could get an extra 200k by changing the deal at the last minute. \r\n\r\nUnlucky for them they are dealing with Mike Ashley."
