  &gt;&gt;killymag...I can think of a few other bloggs where you could post that
  goal link! There is alot of negativity about Best knocking around on the net
  at the moment and something like that might change a few attitudes!! Deffo
  worth giving him a chance, even without seeing that goal. Wish we had more
  creativity in midfield, but otherwise a canny window for us
