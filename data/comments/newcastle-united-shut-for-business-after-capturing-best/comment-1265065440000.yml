  I'm not sure about Alan Smith and Kevin Nolan being our best players. Fair
  enough Smith puts efforts in and can tackle, although pretty badly sometimes.
  Nolan can header a ball well. Apart from that they bring nothing to the team
  and are so slow its painful to watch. I would happily sell them on.
