  Agreed — I think Tioté is just biding his time for a move away. Shadow of the
  player we came to know in recent years unfortunately.



  Gouffran is a typical Pardew player, hard grafter, doesn't complain when he's
  played out of position, and he cost a pittance.



  Ridiculous that Gouffran lasted the full 90 against Arsenal!
