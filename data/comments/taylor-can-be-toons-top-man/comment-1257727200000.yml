message: "Yeah, Taylor is a decent player, never going to have the footballing brain of a Carvalho or the physical presence of say Vidic or Terry, but has a good future on Tyneside.\r\nIt`s about time he showed a more physical game, make forwards think about his presence.\r\nCould improve his passing game, plus someone has to start marshaling the defense, a bit of verbal communication.\r\nHe has shown aggressiveness and good ability in the air on set pieces, so overall a decent young player with room to improve.\r\nUnderstand, Kilgallon, who is rumored to be a target, also an England U21 could would fit alongside him for a solid central defensive duo.\r\nSee what happens, dont hold your breath!"
