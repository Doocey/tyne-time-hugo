message: "I agree with all of the above.  Taylor's spirit is more of a miss, and Colo's price is no indication of his ability or place in the team.  Yes, I think he probably should go straight back in because he is a quality CB, but only CH sees them training and he'll make the right decision.\r\n\r\nNot sure I'm quite as  confident as Brod on our position at the end of the season, but I think it's going to be far more interesting to watch than the season up to now.\r\n\r\nA lot of our away style has been down to a lack of attacking options, but CH and co have plugged that in the window.  It may take a while to get the balance right, but we should now be able to play away games with the same defensive tightness but while still scoring at the other end.\r\n\r\nSuch an optimist, but from what I've read it could all have gone very much the other way on Tuesday night.  Blip."
