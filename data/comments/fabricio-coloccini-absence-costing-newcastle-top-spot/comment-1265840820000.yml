  Well we do have a game in hand on WBA and even a draw would put us back on top
  of the table . For me automatic promotion is what matters and even if we
  finished 2nd i would see this season as a job well done . The fact that we are
  still ahead of Forest keeps my belief that we will get promotion intact .
