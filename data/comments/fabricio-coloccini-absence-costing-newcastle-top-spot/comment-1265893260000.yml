  every team has an off day. home form will see the job done.forest not signing
  any players in january will cost them dear.still rather be 2nd with game in
  hand same points as top and i bet west brom wish they were same points in
  second with a game in hand.think by end of season we will be 8 points clear of
  wba who will finish in 2nd and forest will come third.
