  As far as I can tell, Hughton isn't making a fuss about it.  What fuss there
  is has been whipped up by the media and various message boards.


  Yes, he did an excellent job last season, but he has only been permanent
  manager for little over a year now.  Maybe he was suitably compensated by a
  promotion bonus at the end of last season?


  As for this season, he's been a PL manager for all of eleven games.  Anybody
  remember Tango Man?  He looked bloody good for a while too.  If CH isn't
  creating a fuss, I'd assume he's quite content in the knowledge that his
  contract is due to be discussed at the end of the year - or perhaps when we've
  seen how good he can be in the transfer window (some very good, but some
  shockers so far - Best and Perch).


  As for moving elsewhere.  Hmmm.  Why give up the opportunity to manage the
  biggest club he's likely to have (apart from Spuds, and I doubt a new contract
  would prevent that)?  Championship club?  Well, he has the pedigree for
  gaining promotion, but I doubt that's how he'd like to be remembered.  PL? 
  Who would be likely to come in for him (save Spuds as I mentioned above)? 
  Only a team in trouble, and I'm not sure he'd want to join such as side.


  No - let's stay calm and hope the Ashley does the right thing at the right
  time.
