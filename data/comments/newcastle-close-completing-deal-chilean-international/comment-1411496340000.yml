  I'm afraid and error in the NewsNow system ended up indexing old articles and
  promoting them as new - hence why this post appeared. As Porciestreet notes, I
  published this on July 22nd, and of course since then, Mauricio Isla has since
  moved to QPR.



  Apologies for that, and my condolences to Isla for the long season he has
  ahead of him!
