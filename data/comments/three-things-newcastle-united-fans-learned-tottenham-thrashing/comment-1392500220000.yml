  Disagree that Unlucky 13 should be in instead of Taylor, who has played poorly
  of late but the decision making of the Frenchman is terrible as is his
  positional play. (The penalty against Chelsea when the ball isn't going
  anywhere near there?)

  I don't think there is much between then right now so I'll take Taylor
  until/if Colo is back. 


  Ben Arfa is NOT any sort of answer for central creative needs. Every time he's
  been given an opportunity in there he fails to deliver, his best performances
  have come for us when he's been playing wide. Some of his great solo goals
  have come in the second half where he's been ineffective centrally in the
  first and then moved out wide.
