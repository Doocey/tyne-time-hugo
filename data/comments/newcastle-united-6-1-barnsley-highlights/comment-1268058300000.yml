  great result.  can't help getting a little worried about Nile Ranger tho. He
  doesn't seem like the kind of lad with an awful lot of patience and to be fair
  to him, Leon Best hasn't shown he's a better player at all.  He needs game
  time, reserve football is not gonna do him much good other than keep hime
  reasonably fit.  Why not give him 10 minutes at Barnsley when we are 6-1 up?
