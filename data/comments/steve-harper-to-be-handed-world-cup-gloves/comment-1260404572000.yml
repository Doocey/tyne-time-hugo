message: "By far the best English keeper about atm and good luck to him too and England, imo will have a much better chance with him in goal.\r\n\r\nShould hopefully be another good game tonight and all the results seemed to go for us yesterday too, a win would mean 12 points and 4 games between us and third :)\r\n\r\nFingers crossed"
