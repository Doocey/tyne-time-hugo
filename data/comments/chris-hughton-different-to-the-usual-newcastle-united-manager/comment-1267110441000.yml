message: "Whilst I agree Chrissy has done an excellent job in the fizzy pop, I still think his tactics in EPL at last time of asking were shocking, he may have learned a little in this league but.........and this is the question, when playing teams of similar ability/stature away from home Does he know how to win?\r\nHe may know how to shut up shop and absorb pressure away from home but he struggles to adapt, this would see us struggle in EPL.\r\nI do agree though that he deserves to be given the chance in EPL ...IF we get there after all, his contract expires at the end of next season ,and I think he should be given till then to prove himself (assuming he gets a few points on the board early doors to give confidence).\r\nOne of the problems he may face is when he is given money to improve the squad....his choices so far have been varied in their successfulness, and his handling and motivation skills with superstars (if we get any) is untested this season but , failed miserably last season (under somewhat different circumstances though)!!!!!!\r\nHWTL"
