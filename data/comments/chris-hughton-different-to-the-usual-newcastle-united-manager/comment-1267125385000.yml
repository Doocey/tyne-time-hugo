message: "I think this team would have an even better chance of survival than the one Geordie212100 suggests :-\r\n\r\n            Given\r\nBeye    Taylor  Colo  Enrique\r\nGuthrie Nolan   Barton  Jonas\r\n        Owen    Martins\r\nSubs: Harper, Smith, Viduka, Lovenkrands etc.  \r\n\r\n...but we still got relegated.  So why were we relegated?  Not because our players weren’t good enough, but because they were mis-managed.  Hughton had 7 games in charge last season, and won only 1 point (albeit in difficult circumstances) – an average of 0.14 points per game.  Joe Kinnear (who I think we will all agree is no Wenger / Mourinho / Ferguson etc) managed 23 points from 20 games – an average of 1.15 points per game.  Both managers had the same squad of players and faced the same difficult circumstances prevalent at the club.  So if a mediocre manager won 1.15 points per game, what does that make the manager who only won 0.14 points per game?"
