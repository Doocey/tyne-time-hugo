message: "Neil, good posts and quite refreshing.\r\n\r\nAs for \"NUFC to be a place for proven winners, not novices.....\" I can't see it happening while this owner is here and tbh it's probably a blessing in disguise considering what's happening to the likes of Pompey. Saying that though I want the best at SJP and for a while we did have, I can't see when we will again though afterall this guy never even authourised a replacement for Emre and sold promising young players like Milner and N'Zog etc.\r\n\r\nSurprised we were relegated, no, I hate to say it but we deserved it, why, because of the owner and his decisions and his appointments. Getting us back into the prem is a start but we have to be a challenge to other teams and not just also rans. The real work will begin in the summer if we are promoted, Hughton will certainly have a job on his hands and I wish him good luck and truely hope he's successful."
