message: "Chris deserves all the credit and he deserves a shout I last saw players play like that under KK, the late Sir Bobby and Roeder. \r\n\r\nI can believe u think we will get relegated next season with this spirit in the team I dont think we will look at teams in EPL except Manure, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Spuds, Villa, Everton. No one has a better squad than ours and u all sat we will be relegated. Its about the spirit that is what will drive us on.\r\n\r\nCH Revolution."
