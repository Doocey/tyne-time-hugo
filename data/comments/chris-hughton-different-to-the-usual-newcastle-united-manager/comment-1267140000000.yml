message: "I wonder, to whom is Chuck referring?!  I enjoy reading blogs because, whilst I have my own views, I also like to see whether or not others agree with me – good points well made may even cause me to review my own opinions!  I don’t think it is fair to say that if one fan disagrees with another’s views, then they “obviously have`nt a clue about football.”  \r\n\r\nWhen a fan puts forward the opinion that Hughton isn’t the right man, that isn’t the same as that fan saying that they “know more about the game” than Hughton.  When I criticise Hughton, I’m not necessarily saying that I could do a better job myself, or that we should sack him and appoint a random supporter or blogger instead (I thought that this went without saying).  I’m comparing him to other managers and concluding that I don’t think he is good enough to be manager of a club of the size and stature of Newcastle United.  I look at other teams who I think we ought to be competing with, and who they have as their manager (e.g. O’Neill at Aston Villa, Moyes at Everton, Hodgson at Fulham) – men who have track records of success as managers at the top level over a number of years.  I want someone who overachieves with the resources at their disposal.  Someone who commands respect throughout the football world.  Someone who can attract the right players.  Hughton doesn’t fulfil any of those criteria.  Had we been doing exceptionally well right now (e.g. if we were 15 points clear, on a cup run and playing good football), then perhaps I would have warmed to him.  But we’re not, despite having a squad and resources the like of which the Championship has never seen."
