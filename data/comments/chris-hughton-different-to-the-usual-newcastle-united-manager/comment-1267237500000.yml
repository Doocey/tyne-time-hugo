message: "Chuck: I totally agree – Shearer won 3 points from 8 games.  That’s 0.375 points per game, which is nowhere near good enough and a factor in why we were relegated.  But, as I said in my earlier post, Hughton won 1 point from 7 games.  That’s 0.14 points per game.  You say Shearer got us relegated, but it is undeniable that, of the four(!) managers we had last season , Hughton was the most culpable of them all – the figures are undisputable.  In my opinion, they all have to take a share of the responsibility, including Keegan, Hughton, Kinnear, Shearer, Ashley, Wise, the players – everyone.  \r\n\r\nI agree that we were stripped of some of our best players.  But once the summer transfer window closed and we still had Harper, Taylor, Coloccinni, Enrique, Jonas, Smith, Barton, Carroll, Ameobi etc. in the squad, it was clear that automatic promotion would be a minimum requirement.  So lets not get carried away at the fact that we might reach our minimum requirement.  As for the team spirit thing, that is just a natural consequence of winning games and being at the top of the league – all due to having by far the best squad in the league and resources that our competitors can only dream of, rather than anything Hughton has said or done.  \r\n\r\nI’d be happy for Hughton to get an opportunity at being a manager, to cut his teeth, learn his trade and gain some experience - but not at Newcastle United.  That’s because I think that all managers should start in the lower leagues and work their way up to a club like NUFC.  I want NUFC to be a place for proven winners, not novices trying their hand at management.  But then, I want us to strive to be the best we can be, whereas others are satisfied with mediocrity."
