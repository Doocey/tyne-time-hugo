  From the USA, I love this team.  NUFC and the Geordies remind me so much of
  the Boston Red Sox - A burning desire to win at the highest level, consistent
  questioning of management's abilities and wisdom, total commitment to see the
  team wherever &amp; whenever, and a touch of misery are always present.  This
  is the hallmark of longevity, and that will see you through the hard times. 
  My boy (9) has never touched English soil, but he wears the black and white
  every chance he gets.  Keep it up, and up we go!
