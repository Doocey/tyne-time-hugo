message: "Niel\r\nWas`nt it Shearer that got us relegated ?\r\nthree points from  the last eight games, not exacly a sterling record.\r\nAnd how can you critisise a manager who took the remnants of a relegated team stripped of its best players and made them into a cohesive group with self esteem and to-getherness at present leading the league.\r\nGuess you just dont want to give the guy the credit he deserves, for some unknown reason?\r\nYou mention managers with track records, M. O`N.\r\nhe was offered the job here and turned it down.\r\nAs for Moyes he was given an opportunity at Preston when they were in Div 1, yes he brought them to the championship, not a big deal , I remember them as a 1st. division side, a decent manager but has accomplished nothing yet.\r\nIn order to have a track record you have to first get the opportunity to manage and Hughton is doing pretty good right now."
