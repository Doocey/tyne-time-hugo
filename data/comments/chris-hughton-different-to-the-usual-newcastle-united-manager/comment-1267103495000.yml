  must admit hughton looks decent in the championship ship but that was expected
  with our squad and the half decent opposition,just look at when we played the
  better teams in this league did we really look unbeatable?.I think we will get
  promoted but the quality in the prem has upped a few levels since we were
  there and i think we need heavy investment in midfield and defence just to
  stay up,even the lesser teams in the prem look quite good now,,good luck
