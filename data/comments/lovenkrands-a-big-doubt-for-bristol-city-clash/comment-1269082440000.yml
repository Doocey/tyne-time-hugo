message: "Yeah your right Alex, 4-4-2 is the only way to go but i would rather see Ranger given a go instead of Best i've not been impressed with best's perfomance's so far and he's going to have to improve 150% to change my mind on that, think he should be one of the first to go in the summer.\r\nSee you there anyone who's going :-) \r\n\r\nHWTL"
