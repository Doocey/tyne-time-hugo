  Doocey your right mate , this will be no easy game but i think we will win  ,
  i would be happy with 4 points from our next 2 games then beat Forest at SJP .
  I hope if Lovenkrands is out injured that he plays either Best or Ranger
  upfront and sticks to 442 and does not go 4411 and play butt that would be
  asking for trouble .
