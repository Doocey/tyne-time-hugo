message: "everyone makes mistakes, lets just hope Andy learnt something from his.\r\nWould be gutted to see andy go, either because he was sold or other clubs want him. He has what it takes to be a good striker, maybe not the best, but certainly, from what I saw, he can be as good as the likes of Heskey and Carew, if not better.\r\nlets just hope this won't happen again."
