  Now im sorry but Veloso will not sign for us. He would cost a lot of money
  with the Â£12-18 million being bandied about and we cant afford to spend it on
  one player when so many positions needing to be filled. I scared about the
  mackem game this weekend because we are so awful now. If Joe Kinnear cant get
  the team motivated for a derby you have to question his managerial ability.
