  We entered the last game of the season needing only 1 point(even before the
  game most thought that would be enough.. and thats what elapsed) against a
  poor Villa side who's form was, to say the least, completely useless,  but our
  money motivated players appeared disinteretsed after the first 10 minutes and
  when the Duffy deflect snuggled into Harpers bottom corner you expected a real
  finale .. but a whimper (not strong enough) was all we got as the money
  motivated men, masquading as decicated footy players, trudged down the tunnel
  with bonus thoughts and tranfers on there mind, no thought during the final 15
  minutes to shoot or even consider enough pressure to challenge an equaliser..
  May be the Ashley mentality had spread to the players !! (just don't do
  anything about it)
