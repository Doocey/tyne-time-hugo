  GDS loves to party, and that was his downfall at Barcelona and Spurs as it
  affected his performances in training and in games<br><br>He was shipped off
  to Galatasary, in a Muslim country, where he couldn&#39;t party like he&#39;s
  used to, and it improved his game<br><br>If he was to play in Newcastle, he
  end up getting into his old bad habits, get hooked on brown ale, and end up
  getting fat and slow
