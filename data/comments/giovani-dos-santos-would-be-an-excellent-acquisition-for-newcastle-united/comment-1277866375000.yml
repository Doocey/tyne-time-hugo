  Aye Honda is out of our price range probably. Expect to see manure or arsenal
  bag that lad this summer. Okazaki however the young (record goal scoring) no.9
  who got the third against denmark is still in the J-league now and would be
  available at around 3mil. <br><br>Dos Santos likes to run around a lot to no
  avail - I remember that in the past about him. A good runner but don&#39;t we
  need penetrative forwards not another headless chicken to keep jonas company.
