  Yes he has talent, but he&#39;s exactly the type of player NUFC acquired in
  abundance that resulted in your relegation - which, BTW, was prob the best
  thing that could&#39;ve happened, giving you the chance to clear the decks and
  build a hungry squad from scratch. I&#39;d have thought you guys would&#39;ve
  learned your lesson and shy away from foreign primadonna types in favour of
  building a core of young British players who have a work ethic and team
  spirit. If you want one of our players, someone like Jamie O&#39;Hara would be
  a much better move for you, but if you insist you can have GDS for Â£6m.
