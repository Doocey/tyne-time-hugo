  Good article. I knew that he was a very good defender from his time in
  Deportivo La Coru√±a.

  I always knew that he would adapt to The Premiership he just needed some time.
  I don't think he did that badly in his first season either he was unfortunate
  to have such terrible displays from his teammates to make things harder for
  him. Many people over reacted and started having their doubts. He's proved
  them wrong and Keegan and I right. I am really pleased for him and the team
  and all that's is needed is to invest wisely and replace crap (Ameobi, Smith,
  Perch, Campbell, Xisco) with good.
