  Can't believe our defensive frailties are being pinned to the RB position.
  Both goals against wolves came because of Williamson, goals against spurs and
  fulham came because of a lack of support from the midfield. Am I the only one
  thinking that Simpson has had too many good games this season to be warranted
  this kind of stick. Fed up with scape goating him. First it was Obertan, now
  Simpson. Rediculous
