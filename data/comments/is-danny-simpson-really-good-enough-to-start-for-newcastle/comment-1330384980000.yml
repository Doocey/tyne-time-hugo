  Lot of people fancying Santon at RB - personally not sure how he'd fare.

  Behind Ben Arfa, and supporting him could be quality though for sure.


  Thing about Santon, his LB position allows him to drive down the wing, take on
  left-backs, cut in and have a smack or deliver a good ball which is refreshing
  to see.


  If Ferguson ready for first team football though?
