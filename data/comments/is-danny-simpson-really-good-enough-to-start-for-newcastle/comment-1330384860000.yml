  I think you'll find Obertan was never a scape-goat on this site!


  Simpson unfortunately for me, has had too many poor games this season. As
  mentioned below, he tends to allow a huge amount of crosses into the box - and
  to be quite frank, his own delivery leaves a little to be desired.


  True about Williamson on Saturday though - had a poor game, and not his first
  ever poor one either.
