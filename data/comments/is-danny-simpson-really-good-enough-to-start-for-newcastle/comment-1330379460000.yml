  I think you are spot on, he is the weak link in our team for sure in my
  opinion. Positionally awful, backs off his man all the time and doesn't stop
  crosses/shots coming in as displayed with the first goal on Saturday.


  Dont know if its a right back thing but he seems to do the old Stephen Carr
  thing too of blaming everyone else whenever he drops a clanger.


  Can't believe there is a 5 year deal on the table for him and strangely I
  can't believe he hasn't signed it as im baffled as to where he thinks he can
  go better than what he has at the moment.


  Short term I would either play Ryan there or move Santon across and play Ryan
  or Ferguson at left back but long term we surely have to be able to bring
  someone in better?


  The clearances off the line thing just papers over the cracks too - lets be
  honest most of the time that is down to the luck of the ball hitting you
  rather than any kind of skill or judgement.
