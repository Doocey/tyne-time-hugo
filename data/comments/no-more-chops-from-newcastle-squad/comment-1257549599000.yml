message: "Could very well be, it has to be apparent to MA at this stage,that promotion is essential to his plans.\r\nWhether that is to continue as owner or to eventually sell.\r\nThere`s going to be no gamble this season on gaining a top flight spot, hopefully.\r\nIn which case it would warrant a bit of dosh spent not on second tier level players but on those who could compete in the premiership.\r\nApart from Kilgallon, seems Hughton has either not reached any conclusions about who he would like, or is keeping it to himself."
