  Come off it Chris both you and we know that you will do what you are told. If
  Ashley says sell then that is what will happen. Llambias said the other day
  that NUFC were more interested in buying 16 or 17yr olds or if a player came
  available at 1 million NUFC would try and get him. This shows the level of
  ambition from the owner and his glove puppet.
