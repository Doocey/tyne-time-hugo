  Ok chaps, look at the facts, not the rumours. Over the past 16 years i've been
  supporting Newcastle we've been linked to everyone under the sun. With Enrique
  definately out, Barton most probably and Nolan debateable; arguably, 3 of our
  most important players last season (top 3 scorers of the season already gone?)
  barring Tiote and Jonas. Who have we got in? Cabaye so far, Gervinho i doubt
  to be honest, Neil Taylor and perhaps Zogbia? Point is we're losing proven
  bedded-in players for cheaper gambles that will take 1-2 years to reach the
  level and understanding of the game as the current ones. Compare N.Taylor with
  Enrique who's been one of our top performers for the past 2 years, enough said
  on that. Apart from Zogbia, who can fill the void on Barton and Nolan come
  August? Answer is, forget all the big names that apprear everywhere on the
  net, be realistic. Although we're getting 'bargain' younger players that might
  prove to be decent acquisitions, pushing further up the table for the next
  season looks more dim than ever. And no matter what tabloids say about who
  we're linked with just so they can keep the fans happy and clicking on their
  websites, and trust me we got 3 more months of this meaning another 10-15
  linked players by then minimum, i believe its gonna be a tougher season coming
  round. I hope im proven wrong...
