  Sadly I fear we are in for a dissapointing summer, heard all the hype from in
  and around the club many times before. With no european football, an owner who
  wants to pay minimal wages on short term contracts and a manager whose hardly
  a massive name in world football I dont see why the average player would
  choose us over anyother premier league club.


  I hope im wrong though and keep my figures crossed that come the start of the
  season we have had more quality players in that we've let go.
