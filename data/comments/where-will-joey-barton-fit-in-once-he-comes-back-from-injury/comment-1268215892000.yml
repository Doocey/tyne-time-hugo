message: "I'd like to see a midfield of Barton and Guthrie if Barton can get back in form. I see him as a better box to box midfielder than Nolan and whilst he not play as high and get as many goals he will be bossing the game about and allowing our wingers and Guthrie to do their job. Barton box to box, hard tackles an incisive passing. Danny creates space, passes well, has a good free kick and shoots from way back. Nolan likes to be in the box for goals, is a big lad and not afraid to be the hard man and brings experience to a team that is getting younger and younger. They all offer something very different.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the future holds for Smith who just cannot score a goal but he will be useful in Away games and whenever we need that extra man in front of the defence. Whether that is worth paying 60g a week for, when far more talented players are on less is very debatable."
