  Barton is better than Smudger and Nobby?! I know it's your opinion but mate,
  honestly, Barton wouldn't come close to Smudger and Nobby... Or even Danny!
  Barton is talented but I think the midfield we have is strong enough and
  should be looking to get rid of Barton a bring in someone just as good who is
  willing to accept a lower wage then 60k
