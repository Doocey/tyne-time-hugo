message: "He always takes about 5-6 games to get back into top form so should be eased back in gradually. I do think that he is better than Nolan and Smith and instances like the Swansea game where we were outpassed until Guthrie cut inside in the last 10 minutes wouldn't happen with Barton on the pitch.\r\n\r\nHowever he takes 5 games to get to his full potential, plays a few blinders then gets injured again. Should be his last chance fitness wise really. Shame, abit like Emre, fiery midfield with bags of talent, but always in the treatment room."
