message: "Does`nt have to fit anywhere, there`s horse`s for course`s, it`s known as platooning where you use certain players against certain teams.\r\nAnd there`s allways injuries, which Joey can attest too, most teams need well over twenty player sides, due to both the number of games, plus tactically playing against different sides.\r\nFor instance, playing against Arsenal a team would need a bunch of neanderthals to kick the be***us out of them (kidding folks) but you get the idea."
