  I agree, I don't see him as our we worshipped no. 9 to be honest and worry
  about his attitude if things aren't going his way.

  If he starts well all is Rosie but if he has a similarly slow start like Ba,
  and the fans start to question him (as we did with Ba), I'm not convinced he
  had the same mental strength as Ba and may well spit his dummy.

  Finding a striker for Newcastle is hard, finding a no. 9

  is even hard...but... in Carr we trust!!
