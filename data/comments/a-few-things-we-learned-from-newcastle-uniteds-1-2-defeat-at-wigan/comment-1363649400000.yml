  Young Macca did not intend to your player. I do hope he is soon up and playing
  and good luck to the lad. You did not mention that most of the Latics fans
  stood up and applauded your injured player off the field. No on wants to see a
  player carried off. 

  As to your puerile remarks about our club, unlike you Barcodes we have never
  been relegated from the premier league and unlike you we don't have delusions
  that we are a big club. Each year you turn up with ideas that you are going to
  beat us because you are 'The Toon', and each year you get beaten, oh sorry you
  have your worst game of the season (on an annual basis). 

  As to relegation, come back and apologise when we stay up. Just because we
  dont fill our stadium does not mean we should not be in the premier league.
  Bye the way is 'The Toon'in the semi final of this years FA cup. What do you
  think your going to win this season? I'll tell you, what you've won for te
  past donkeys years - diddly squat.

  One poor taclkle does not make a bad club ask Mr Shearer. 

  Once again best wishes for a speedy recovery to your injured player.
