  Im sorry but any player who leaves the ground with both feet , going into a
  tackle to win a ball above the knee is either a moron or meant to do damage,
  the fact he has previous while a youth player vs Man City (breaking a players
  leg after another "accidental" collision) shows me he did exactly what he
  wanted to do, he got the ball above Haidaras knee and must have known he
  couldnt or was not in control of himself as he made the tackle.

  Where did he think his foot would go that high up the leg and why did he not
  apologize afterwards.

  The fact he did not even think of seeing if Haidara was ok afterwards is a
  measure of the person, he will have heard Haidara scream and fall to the
  ground but carried on playing the ball he "won".

  He is a thug and needs banning for this challenge even if he didnt mean it, he
  may think twice before going into a challenge that high with both feet off the
  ground IMHO
