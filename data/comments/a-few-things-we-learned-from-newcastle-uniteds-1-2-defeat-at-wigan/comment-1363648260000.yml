  I too was at the DW stadium on Sunday last and sat in the East stand. The fact
  is that Mcmanaman won the ball, but his momentum carried him into the player.
  It was a terrible accident, not an intentional foul as many armchair observers
  seek to make out. We should all sympathise with the injured player: not
  demonise a young player for a unintended act.
