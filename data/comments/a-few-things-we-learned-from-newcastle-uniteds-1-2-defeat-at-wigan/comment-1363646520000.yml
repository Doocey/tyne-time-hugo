  Am a wigan supporter &amp; was at the game yesterday, from my vantage point in
  the east stand (directly behind the sh*thouse tackle) it initially looked like
  a hard challange as we didnt get the side on view until I saw it on MOTD later
  which of course is damming. we were all waiting for the ref to book him 4 the
  hand ball. I must admit I did applaud McMan when subed but this was without
  full knowledge as to the nature of the incident, to which knowing the facts I
  now regret. I hope Haderia is Ok and will be back playing soon that has to be
  everyones main concern. Regards comments from the club I am completly
  embarresed &amp; disgusted. The club should apologise unreservadly whether it
  was intentional or not and suspend McMan for the rest of the season as an
  absolute minimum irrespective of what the FA dish out. On a lighter note if
  there can be 1 at this time NUFC are the best supported team I have ever
  witnessed at the DW &amp; the sight of the teletubbies dancing along to Im a
  beliver in the away end before the kick off was priceless.
