  Our lad got to the ball then caught the player.  See it any way you like, its
  not the first time there,s been an over enthusiastic tackle and it wont be the
  last.  The handball for the winner was poetic justice after the same player
  was sent off for nuts all reasons in the reverse fixture at your ground.  Get
  Pards a dish cloth to wipe that egg off his face after his little war dance in
  front of our manager, who has always been the complete professional .  And, to
  round off,  our chairman was paving the way in the retail sports gear game
  when your boss was still sucking his mums thripenny bits.  A little respect
  please.
