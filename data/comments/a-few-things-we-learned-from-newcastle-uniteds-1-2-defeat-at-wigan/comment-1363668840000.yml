  Unless you're a good friend of the lad or a relation then you have no idea
  what he meant or did not mean to do.


  Most Geordies are realistic, we don't expect to win anything in any given
  season. We just want the best from the players on the pitch and 5th place in
  the Premier League last season when you lot just about scraped survival was
  something the travelling support deserved for their years of unwavering
  support.



  You might in the FA Cup, but come back when you're in the Quarter Finals of
  Europe. Europe, not the FA Cup. Cheers.
