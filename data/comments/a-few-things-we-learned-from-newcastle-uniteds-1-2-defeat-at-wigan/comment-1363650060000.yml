  sorry but how do you know what "young Macca" meant to do, we will see when the
  FA ban him what they think, and as to your we have never been relegated from
  the premier league crack, how many times have you played in russia, spain,
  portugal, etc............exactly, were a club, not the biggest club not the
  smallest club, and we as you have, earned the right to be in the premier
  league and Europe (both the Champions league and Europa league) I used to like
  the Wigan, and Martinez (wasnt too keen on Whelan but there you go) but after
  more than a few of your fans and Martinez are supporting this tackle and its
  endangerment,I hope you fail in your attempt to stay in the league, then
  hopefully we will never have the misfortune to play your thug again
