  Keane would be a very good signing as he would take on-field pressure off of
  the young Caroll and enable both Shola and Lovenkrands to last out the season
  more effectively. A strong, but mature personality should be able to fit into
  change room atmosphere, too. A far better prospect than Ben Arfa, who may not
  settle and if not then certainly won't produce anything near what we would
  want to see on the pitch, either. The up side of Keane is known and the risk
  can be limited to a season long loan, but with Ben Arfa, the up side is
  questionable and the risk is very high, indeed.
