  30% of his vages is way optimistic. 70-80% would be more likely, I'd say,
  cause he can still play an important back-up role in Spurs.  Hope we can make
  the deal, there's still plenty of football left in him. I've always been a fan
  of his skills, no matter what crappy club he's been in. I think he can do well
  in a 2-span with Carroll, or any other setup, as he's very adaptable and a
  teamplayer to boot, always giving 110% on the pitch. And of course, NUFC won't
  put Â£7-9 mill on the table for him, but I hope they can make the loan deal
  come through.
