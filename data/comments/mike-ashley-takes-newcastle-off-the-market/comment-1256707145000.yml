message: "I have felt empty ever since everything kicked off now I just feel like the club has been taken away from me.. it's all in his hands, with the FA saying that they would be interested in investigating new owners of football clubs then they should investigate Ashley because he doesn't know how to run one.\r\n\r\nI have no clue what planet this man/mouse thinks he's on, there's no way I will ever lose my interest in supporting the team, but I just find it hard to fund a loser. I've stopped going to Sports Soccer, sports direct and any other business of his since his problems began.. no interest in this joke, I don't think there's anything he can do to reverse things."
