  "Stephen Ireland is mentally unwell and has been for the past 2 years", Nice
  one, I had a good long laugh at that. For me, the club incident with Leon Best
  was the last straw. The boy is a bad egg (literally). We have taken enough
  risks on misfits and injury prone players. Ireland had his chance.
