  No way do I want him back. Ed, I think you are still living in 2008.


  Stephen Ireland is mentally unwell and has been for the past 2 years. He
  cannot cope with the pressure of playing week in week out and has been making
  excuses for the past 2 years so he can continue picking up a good wage. 


  It all started at city when his mind went, and he told the club he couldn't
  play because his grandmother had died. It was a lie and the club found out,
  shipped him out quickly after that.


  He has been the same at villa, and seems more and more erratic and saying some
  crazy stuff in interviews


  Doesn't play well anymore either, so no way!
