  I really hope that Mort can push a deal through this week as the thought of
  the Fat Man and Dreary O Leary running the show is a terrible prospect he's
  even threatening to show his face at the games if he stays doesnt he
  understand what he's doing to the players the fans the club and the city of
  Newcastle it gets more depressing by the hour oh i nearly forgot we've got 2
  young 'uns from Spurs on loan to make the numbers up i'll bet thats cheered
  everyone up
