  Ashley has changed his mind about Shearer for one thing only.... Shearer laid
  his cards on the table to Ashley, told him what he wanted and never said YES
  to Ashley on every point. Ashley has undoubtely proved a success in his
  businesses (barring NUFC) but he, like most successful businessmen, is
  egotystical and blind to adviceapart from his own. Please sell up Ashley, buy
  the mackems and bugger them up!
