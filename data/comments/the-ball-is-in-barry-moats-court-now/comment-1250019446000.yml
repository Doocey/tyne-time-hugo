  What i cant understand is Ashley said that appointing Alan Shearer as manager
  last season was the best thing he'd done and now if he stays it looks like
  he's going to completley blank Alan out by appointing Dreary O Leary as
  manager if he dares show his face at the Reading game there's talk of NUSC
  having a first half of tributes to Sir Bobby and a second half of telling the
  Fat Man to F**K OFF
