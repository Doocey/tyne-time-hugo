  Just read if business cant be done with Mort this week Ashley will take the
  club off the market and appoint David O Leary as manager if this happens it
  will be another kick in the teeth for Alan (Shearer)&amp; the fans this is
  really bad news as Alan confirmed that Ashley has no intention of spending any
  more money on the club the nightmare continues as we await more news
