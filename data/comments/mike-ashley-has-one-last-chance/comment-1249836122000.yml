  Doocey it will all end in tears if he stays ( lets face it enough of them have
  been shed over recent weeks ) Alan ( Shearer ) confirmed what we all knew that
  Ashley has no intention of spending anymore money on the club so there'll be
  no new players to replace the very small squad we have so everyone he sells
  it'll be money in his back pocket grrrrrrrr i hate what he's doing to the club
  i really hope we hear good news this week
