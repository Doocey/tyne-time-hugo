  I just thought I'd tell you that I really like your blog, I like to check
  yours and Ed's every few hours or so, what I don't get is why people don't
  comment on your blog as much as Ed's blog I like to read peoples comments as
  it shows everyone's opinion on the subject that is being talked about at the
  time I find it very interesting.


  I hope people start using your blog and commenting a bit more often but
  obviously dont abandon Ed's blog he deserves alot of respect for what he is
  doing and for what he has done.


  Good luck with your blog hope it picks up soon!
