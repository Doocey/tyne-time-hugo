message: "What a ridiculous rumour. Tamudo has consistantly been one of the top scorers in Spain and is a quality player. There would be a mass of premiership clubs in for him. \r\n\r\nIts not like its a stage of his career that he can look to the future at Newcastle. Quality player, so therefore no chance with his wages, transfer fee and ambition."
