message: "Good cup game today!\r\nAt a quick glance I thought this was an article by an Argyle fan when I saw the headline! But i think it's a problem for us but for different reasons due to our polar opposite league positions. Especialy since our transfer embargo hasnt been sorted yet and our loanees have pretty much all returned to their clubs and our squad isnt exactly packed with gifted players like your lot. Will be a good replay though and possibly maybe a bit of t.v money (come on itv!) and i dont think either club will be too botherd with the result to be fair!\r\nCheers."
