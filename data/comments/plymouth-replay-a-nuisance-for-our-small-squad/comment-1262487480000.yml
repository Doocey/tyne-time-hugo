message: "Perhaps this and the recent run of poor results will convince the board that if this club has ambitions about being  promoted,and apparently they do, now is the time to put their money where their mouths are.\r\nThere are no guarantee`s it will happen and it`s not inconceivable we could lose out.\r\nThis side needs strengthening and now is the time to do it, why risk waiting until summer when it could be too late."
