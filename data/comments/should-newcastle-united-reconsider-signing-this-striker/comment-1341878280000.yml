message: "Only thing if Gameiro arrived, he'd expect to start week in week out, wouldn't he?\n\nAfter all, he's looking to leave PSG for first team football, not stay on an bench I'd assume.With Ba, Ciss√©, Ben Arfa making our forward three in the Premier League - there's no starting spot for him really.\_\n\nWould be a fan of Guidetti as he's young but he too, would probably demand a starting role like he did in Holland.\n\nInteresting case we have - who do we buy that won't moan at not starting every Sat/Sun?"
