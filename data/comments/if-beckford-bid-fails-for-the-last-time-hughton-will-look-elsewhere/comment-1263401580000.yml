  I think the fall back plan is indeed to get Harewood and Zurab back on loan
  and that wouldn't be all that bad. Then we could try to sign Beckford and
  Kilgallon in the saummer for free - although it looks like Everton have
  Matthew tied up. We could also get Simpson for free in the summer - if we can
  extend his loan until the end of the season - and certainly Ferguson doesn't
  seem too keen to take him back to Old Trafford.
