  victor moses i agree would be an exceptional signing, but cant see that
  happening!! we will end up with no one, a couple of loan signings is what i
  expect!! Club still has no forward thinking, no stability and certainly no
  direction, these clowns at the helm need a kick up the backside!! houghton has
  done a good job dont get me wrong, but not convinced about anything at nufc,
  nothing suprises me, it is so upsetting how far we have dropped!! In my
  opinion we should be buying 17 18 19 year olds who will do a job in this
  league and can then be nurtured when back in the premier league with some more
  experienced and better players bought when promoted! Nile ranger should be
  playing week in week out, give the kid a real run of games, vuckic why hasnt
  he featured?? if he is as good as everyone says, were crying out for a
  creative midfielder!!
