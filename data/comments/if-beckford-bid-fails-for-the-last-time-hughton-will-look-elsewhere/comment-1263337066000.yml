message: "CH appears to be confident of landing Beckford,but if this drags on he will have to look else where, with Harewood being the only worthy option left.\r\n\r\nAs for the above mentioned, i personally think Wittingham is not the striker we need, Sharp is hit and miss in this league,never mind the PL. Maynard would be the striker i would like, but as Bristol City paid over 2 million for him hes out of our league ! Sad isnt it!\r\n\r\nBeckford or Harewood...........lets pray the Toon and Leeds can find some middle ground and pay Â£1.75 million."
