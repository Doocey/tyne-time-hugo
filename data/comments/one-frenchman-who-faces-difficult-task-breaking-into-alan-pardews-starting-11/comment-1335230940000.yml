message: "Gabby was a faithful servant during those 13 odd games he started regularly and will undoubtedly become a great impact sub but his indecision and wastefulness was just sooo frustrating. What the team needed it got when Hatem was deployed, with his confidence and will to challenge opposition head on the direct opposite of Gabby's faltering.\_\n\nBut I like Obertan, and if Pardew has made Guthrie a great midfielder and turned once despised Shola (nicknamed all sorts of things) into this impact sub who is actually cheered on, then he'll get something out of Gabby's talent. I remember the Man U away game where he really dominated Evra, and I see he has potential but short on confidence"
