  a.stanton.....where in the article does it say we weren't beaten by the better
  side?...we do have (on paper) tougher games ahead,by teams higher in the
  league than you(so get over yourself)..........don't believe what you read,its
  not the toon fans that think we're big players,thats all crap printed in the
  papers.we know better than anyone how long it is since we won something.We've
  been let down so many times and thats why none of us believe promotion is a
  certainty,yet the rest of the country keep saying we are!!! So you carry on
  believing the crap you've read in the past and we'll keep doing what we've
  always done,supporting our team.
