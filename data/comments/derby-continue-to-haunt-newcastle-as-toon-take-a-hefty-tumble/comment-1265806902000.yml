  I believe it refers to derby being mediocre this season,can you deny
  that?....I like everyone else I've spoke to thinks we were beaten by the
  better team,tho I think the scoreline flattered you a little(imo) but thats
  what happens when you don't take your chances and the opposition do.We don't
  think we have a right to be up there but we do think we should be.I would say
  its more a case of blind optimism/fanaticism but thats what following your
  team is all about,even tho deep down you know it may never happen.It certainly
  hasn't for the last 41 years(not 60) but we always live in hope that next year
  will be our year.Good luck for the rest of the season and tell nigel to do a
  proper job on billy davies next time.
