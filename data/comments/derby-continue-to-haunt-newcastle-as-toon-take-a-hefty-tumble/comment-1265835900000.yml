  Yeah Icedog, it wasn't nice to see our 10 point gap slip but that';s the
  Championship for you.

  You can't argue that Derby aren't a mediocre team, they've awful in some parts
  on the season, none-less than their home game against Blackpool a few weeks
  back. They play well against the bigger teams. 

  If we don't win at Swansea then it'll be tough but I've a feeling we'll pull
  ourselves together (again :)
