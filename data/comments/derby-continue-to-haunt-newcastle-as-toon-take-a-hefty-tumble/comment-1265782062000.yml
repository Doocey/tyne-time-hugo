message: "Er...well where does it say you WERE beaten by the better side? It says Derby are \"mediocre\" and that you \"threw it out the window\" and that you \"didnt play awful\". The fact is you got beat, good and proper. If we are as bad as the writer suggests, it seems odd that you have failed to beat us in two attempts this season, and we have stuck three goals past you in the process.\r\n\r\nI dont need to believe what I read papers about Toon army fans. I know quite few of them, and they all have this absurd notion about their future destiny with greatness, the promised land which awaits them, and to which they feel they are entitled, as if it was some kind of ancient Biblical decree. All this hyperbole despite the hard evidence to the contrary over the last sixty or so years."
