  true icedog,cardiff apart we haven't looked great all season scraping alot of
  points.Thats all well and good but it doesn't leave a great margin for errors
  and almost every team we've played has had quite a few chances but unlike
  Derby they haven't put them away.I hope we do what we did after the scunnny
  defeat and go on another good run because we're gonna need to.HWTL
