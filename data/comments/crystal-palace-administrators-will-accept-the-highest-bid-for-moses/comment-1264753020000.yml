  We have made a bid alng with Forest, and WBA, and also it is said that these
  are increased bids, so thats indication that we have made a bid before aswell.
  I hope he comes but we may struggle to get him if a decent EPL team come in
  for him. As it stands where the only ones bidding, along with Forest, and WBA,
  and Man City are tied up with trying to get Johnson, hopefully everyone will
  join that fight and leave us to take Moses, but with the Admin revealing that
  they are considering bids from us, Forest, and WBA it is an indication that
  they are wanting other teams to join the race.
