message: "why is everyone exicted! i reckon we have put a bid in for him, but man city are in for him so..... as for yesterdays performance... i think nolan need a kick and i was very disappointed in the evening chronicle decision to give pancrete a 6! he came on and done a decent job and tried his best! thats all i want.. not nolan who just seems to be getting worse after a good few games! \r\ngot a tough few games coming up and if we get the results we'll be sure to come top 2! bit nervous for Leicester tho and think we could be on the wrong side of a battering!"
