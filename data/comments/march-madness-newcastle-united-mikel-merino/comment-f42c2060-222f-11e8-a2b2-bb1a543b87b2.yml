  Yes, Merino has a lot of talent. His big flaw is that he overcommits and loses
  balance in challenges, leaving himself floundering and not able to recover. I
  don’t think he is a defensive midfielder. He would be so much better further
  forward in a free flowing attack. Unfortunately we don’t play like that
