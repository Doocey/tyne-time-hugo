message: "DJG...i think with the team we have got, we can do a couple of shrewd loan signings (wilshere :P) to cover us for an injury crisis and possibly Killgallon as we are short at the back, but for once i hope we dont sign too many players. \r\n\r\nWithout taking anything for granted we have opened up a gap at the top without really playing good football and WBA cant seem to hold a run together. 6 million on championship quality players would be a waste, unless they are young and would be able to move up a division. But i would like to see money to towards survival next season, not promotion this season. Although there are a few hidden gems, look at Roger Johnson at Birmingham.  \r\n\r\nAll this obviously is assuming that we don't loose anybody!!!!!"
