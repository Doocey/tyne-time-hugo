message: "n/ jedi\r\nYeah all sounds good but where`s the money coming from ?\r\nKilgallon, who says we can sign him with PL  clubs apparently interested, same goes for all the youngsters you mentioned. \r\nBe lucky to sign two decent players during this window, that probably includes Simpson, who hopefully we can extend his loan untill the end of the season.\r\nAnd four mill. for Johnson, no way,not with big clubs looking at him.\r\nIt`s going to be an interesting window, should say a lot as to what Ashleys intentions are concerning the club."
