message: "Well....For a start anyone who thinks we should not sign players in january incase they might not cut it in the PL are simply idiot's! \r\n\r\n1. We are not promoted yet. We are a long way off it infact!\r\n\r\n2. Our main and only priority is promotion. Not staying in the PL next year; planning for that scenario starts in April/May if we can finish in the top two. \r\n\r\n3. Anyone who can come in now and contritbute to that one goal will be welcomed in open arms by both CH and the other newcastle players. \r\n\r\n4. Securing PL status again at the end of the season will bring in vast amounts of cash (approx 50 million); so a 6 million investment now is a must to ensure we get back to the PL.\r\n\r\nCH will know that any players which we bring in will have to be;\r\n\r\n(a) better than the ones we have already got or (b) players who can add something different to the current playing staff.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind; in the Jedi's opinion i feel the force is strong with any of the players listed below...\r\n\r\nTransfer fee's\r\n\r\nSimpson (First and foremost let's secure young Danny on a permanent deal)\r\n\r\nBeckford (2-3 million with his contract running down? Leed smay accept such a bid rather than lose him for nothing)\r\n\r\nJoe Ledley (2-3million again as his contract expires in the summer; creative player whom i think could make the step up to premoership level)\r\n\r\nKilgallon (1.5 million for a player agai tipped to step up in fashion of Phil Jagielka)\r\n\r\nCleverly (2million - currently on loan at watford from Man Utd)\r\n\r\nJohnson (4 million ??? Again his contract is expering and why not go for him? Promotion at this stage looks a pretty good bet so i'm sure boro will look to cash in on him so stracah can strengthen with his own players)\r\n\r\nSam (1-2 million - This kid is very quick and skillfull. Has been a revaltion for charlton this year; albeit in league 1. Again his contract is expiring so is worth a punt for that sort of money in my humble opinion)\r\n\r\nVictor Moses (2-3 million with a sell on clause/further fee's on appearances etc. This young man looks like he will be the real deal. Full of pace and skill. still only 18 and is flying with the super eagles. Gewt him snapped up Chris)\r\n\r\nLoans....\r\n\r\nWilshire (already been discussed and would be a master stroke by Hughton. The lad has it all and will be a star of world football for years. Some newcastle fans seem abit snobbish in this area; as if we are to \"big\" a club to be taking other clubs young players on loan)\r\n\r\nWellbeck/Macheda (Both may be beyond reach; however is sir alex is willing to let either go out for 3-4 months and gain some regular first team football then we should be first in line)\r\n\r\nI feel we may need need to bring another defender in on loan; if we do not sign Kilgallon permanently.\r\n\r\nNow the jedi is off to a galaxy far far away...."
