message: "hhhmmmm....\r\n\r\nDo we go all out to ensure promotion and bring in multiple loans and perminant deals; making sure we don't stew in this league more than one season and almost cirtainly lose stars like Enrique and Jonas. Leaving us with panic buy championship players on the wage bill for years that will sit tight and struggle in the prem.\r\n\r\nOr do we do a deal for Simpson and keep most of this 'supposed' (I know) £6M for the summer when we will get Nicky Butt and Geremi's £120,000 a week off the wage bill and then really strengthen with the better players we could attract. Taking for granted that we will get promoted.\r\n\r\nIts a gamble."
