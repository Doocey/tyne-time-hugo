  Please take Leroy Fer - one of the laziest players ever to wear the shirt. Van
  Wolfswinkel has potential but is an outdated type of player who needs to play
  with a target man which no-one does any more. Redmond is a headless chicken
  with no clue about a final ball. If these players were any good would Norwich
  be going down?
