  As a Norwich fan I read this article fully expecting to see Robert Snodgrass'
  name. He's the only player I'm really bothered about losing if (when) we go
  down... okay, I'd probably be upset about losing Ruddy too, but it should be
  easier to replace a GK.


  You're more than welcome to Redmond - you can have all the pace in the world,
  but it means jack if you have no end product. His crossing is appalling and
  far too often he makes the wrong decision in the final third. I was excited by
  his potential early on, but lately I've grown tired of his making the same
  mistakes again and again - he's not improved over the course of the season,
  and for a young player that is disappointing.



  You hit the nail on the head with Fer - he has flashed glimpses, but that's
  all. For me, he looks great when the rest of the team is playing well but all
  too often he has gone missing when it is not. At the elite level you really
  want your midfielders to be players who can pull the team along with them when
  they are up against it, and Fer has done no such thing this season. 


  Not sure what happens with Ricky, I expect a move back to the continent
  beckons, but if we can't find somebody to sell to there's a chance he has to
  stick around in the championship - that will be interesting! Surely he'll find
  a goal or two at that level... right??


  Good luck to you guys next season - got my fingers' crossed we'll be playing
  you, but I'm not counting on it!!
