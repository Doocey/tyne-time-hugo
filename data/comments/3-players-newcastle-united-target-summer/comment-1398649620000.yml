  Thanks for the insight, Paul.



  I'm interested to hear about Redmond, I do think he has great potential with
  the right coaching - but only time will tell with that.



  Snodgrass is a worthy mention and one which I did consider mentioning. He'll
  likely have plenty of suitors in the summer, who knows, we might be involved.



  Agree about van Wolfswinkel, he'll probably garner a move to Spain, or
  somewhere along those lines. I do think he is a talented player though, just
  hasn't shown such this season.



  Thanks for the kinds comments regards next season - maybe your lot at Carrow
  Road can inspire the lads to one more big victory, who knows. Either way, best
  of luck next season, irrespective of your division.
