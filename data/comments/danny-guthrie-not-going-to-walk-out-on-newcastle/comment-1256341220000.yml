message: "I agree his isn't playing well, but he's being played wide right, and he's a central midfielder. As well as this he's just a young lad, still learning the game. He may not be up to premiership standard yet, but please let me know who in the current first eleven is! Lets get real, there will have to be massive investment\r\non the playing side to make us a premiership club again. With the current owner not likely to invest anything"
