message: "I truely believe Guthrie has a lot of potential if he has the right mentor, something that will be difficult to come by at Newcastle for anytime soon, considering we there is no club foundations and most importantly a manager.\r\n\r\nI see him as a decent playmaker, obviously I can't compare him to Fabregas, but that's the sort of role I see him playing, except we are wasting so much talent because we don't have the bloody stability to bring up youngsters hence why most managers in the past only go out and buy \"quality\" players and not players to develop. The last one I remember is N'Zogbia, but that went down hill soon ever Sir Bobby Robson was for whatever reason sacked."
