  Just been reading that Ashley's extended the deadline so Moat can sort out the
  overdraft thing with Barclays now if's he's struggling with this were will
  this leave him when in January the transfer market opens again because if it's
  another week and he does take the club on the transfer window will be closed
  and no doubt another few players will be away before then i think next week
  this will all fizzle out we'll be stuck with Ashley and the very thin squad
  we've got this ISNT the news we were hoping for i.e. i dont think Moat has
  enough funds to take the club on
