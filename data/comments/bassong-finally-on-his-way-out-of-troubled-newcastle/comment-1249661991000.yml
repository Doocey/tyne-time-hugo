  Well another 2 bail out and another possible 6 are being looked at were/when
  will this shambles end when Ashleys sold all the players who are worth
  anything  we had a very small squad to start with this is getting ridiculous
  now he seems hell bent on totally destroying the club a lot of people were
  saying ''you know what it's ok we'll come straight back up'' but the way
  things are going i think we'll be lucky to survive in the championship
