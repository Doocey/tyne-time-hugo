  Its a footy top,nothing less nothing more.. damn fashion animals that never
  get satisfied. you just dont like the puma shirts simply because it was fat
  mike who negotiated the deal with puma. i bet that the shirt would be seen as
  brilliant if we had another chairman etc. And one more thing,i love that the
  badge isnt embroided,NO MORE SOAR NIPPLES!
