  As much as I like it (hey, I&#39;m a sucker for a new black & white NUFC
  shirt!) I have a few of issues with it.....<br><br>1)  I don&#39;t like the
  fact that the NUFC badge is half-on/half-off the stripes.  It looks cheap &
  tacky.  <br><br>2)  The white surround of the NUFC badge on the black stripe
  makes it look like it&#39;s an iron-on transfer - it had better not
  be.....<br><br>3)  It will be interesting to see if Puma have made as good a
  job as adidas in applying the &#39;Northern Rock&#39; sponsor logo on the
  front.  adidas did a great job of this, yet from the photos, the Puma job
  looks shiny - ie. a cheap iron-on version.<br><br>4)  It looks a bit lopsided
  with the Puma badge in the middle - but then again, adidas did this quite a
  lot in the later years, so I can live with it.<br><br>5)  The shirt material
  looks VERY cheap.  That&#39;s a stand alone comment, without even beginning to
  compare it to the adidas shirts (the same goes for the training wear as
  well).<br><br>6)  We don&#39;t know how the back of the shirt looks.  Is it
  solid black (or white) like the latter adidas shirts were, or is it striped (&
  if it IS striped, what colour will the names & numbers be?).<br><br>7)  Why
  does (& lets be honest here) an inferior quality shirt, made by an inferior
  manufacturer, released in the middle of the biggest global recession in the
  last 30 years, by the owner of the worlds&#39; biggest price under-cutting
  sports shop, cost Â£5 more than the better quality previous shirt?  This is
  absolutely bonkers.<br><br>8)  Why are the away & third shirts the same tacky
  template, just with the colours reversed?  I mean, the only time we&#39;re
  likely (or rather NOT likely) to wear the all white 3rd shirt, is if we end up
  playing Inter Milan away - or Gillingham, or Rochdale.....  Apart from
  that???!!!<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not ALL bad, I do actually
  like the following.....<br><br>1)  The boxer short (as in the fighter, not the
  underwear!) waistband & Puma logo on the shorts.  Although it looks great, I
  can&#39;t imagine it to be very comfortable to wear.....<br><br>2)  I like the
  fact that - even on the white & black training wear - Puma have used a blue
  logo and not a black one, to ensure that there isn&#39;t a &#39;black cat&#39;
  on our kits!!<br><br>3)  Errrmmm.....  I...  Err...  I...  Err... (help me out
  here someone!!)<br><br>4)  It&#39;s black & white and it has a Newcastle
  United badge on it!<br><br>5)  It&#39;s 3:05am, Magnum PI has just come on the
  telly, and I&#39;m eating jam rolly-polly and custard so - gotta
  go!!<br><br>Toon!  Toon!  Keep the faith everyone & remember:  I coulda been
  worse, we coulda been born a mackem...!!
