  ive got it and the northern rock sign i could literally peel off, the shirt is
  cheap, im such a mug for shelling out Â£55 on this shirt and the name and
  number (which you really need to have, otherwise you will have just a huge
  white blanket on your back, which makes this shirt look even worse) Anything
  but a toon top and i wouldn&#39;t even look at it. Sums up the owners, cheap
  manufacture but exploiting the fans and their loyalty, any way of making a
  quick buck eh Ashley...?
