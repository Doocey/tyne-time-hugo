  I agree that players regress under Pardew's management, especially the flair
  players.  The only one's he seems to be able to help are those of modest
  talent who willingly toil - for example Perch and Williamson.  In other words
  players who resemble Pardew as a player.  Players have to be loaned out to
  develop like Dummett.   Setting aside the lack of coaching and the fitness
  problems (which were improved at the start of the season but have now
  regressed) the confidence of the team is shot - like that of fans - because
  the club is drifting aimlessly.  We aren't going forward, we are going
  backward.  We have no creativity and by the end of the season we will have no
  strikers.  Ashley still holds a grudge from when fans got at him after he
  sacked Keegan and he seems to revel in fans discomfort.  He wants to sell so
  won't invest.  Players know that they are with a team going nowhere and it
  shows in their performances when the talisman players aren't in the team. 
  Ashley can wave goodbye to getting his investment in the club back if we are
  relegated, as looks sadly likely, next season.  Changes are needed to try to
  get some fresh momentum.  Changing manager makes sense but the malaise
  affecting the club is deep seated and only a change in Ashley's attitude to
  the running of the club - namely continuity in terms of keeping start players
  - instead of continuity in keeping a pretty average manager - will help take
  us forward.
