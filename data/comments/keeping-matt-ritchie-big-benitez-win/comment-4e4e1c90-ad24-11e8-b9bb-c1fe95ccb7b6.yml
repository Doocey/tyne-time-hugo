  Couldnt agree more Kevin.I am bias though as i am his Uncle.What he lacks in
  pace and height he makes up with his passing and intelligence on the ball.The
  one thing that i have always admired is whenever he can he will play it
  quick.So much football is slow,pass,slow.Defenders will deal with that most
  times.The quick ball catches them out.I watched Matt at Bournemouth and Eddie
  Howe has that same quick ball going forward philosophy.Its good to watch and
  you very rarely get a bad game with Bournemouth playing.Think Newcastle have
  lacked that direct,quick forward over the last couple of years.Calum Wilson
  scored loads of goals with Matt supplying the passes a lot of the time.Pace
  and power.If Newcastle could find a quality forward i think they would become
  a real handful.
