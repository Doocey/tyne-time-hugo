  Well, ask any Newcastle fan if they'd like to be in the advanced stages of the
  Carling Cup and I think you'll see they will.

  Obviously the CCC is the most important and indeed the local fixtures but any
  Cup game always provides a little more entertainment.

  Although granted, we could do without this game considering the thin squad we
  have.
