message: "Who would have thought we would be where we are this season after the start of last season? I mean effin hell 1-1 at Old Trafford against Man.U. Let's not get carried away. The result against Blackpool (not Liverpool) just goes to show how thin our squad is. It may have been another story if Smith wasn't suspended if Ameobi and Gutierrez, wasn't injured and Ranger wasn't burned out. But they are and it wasn't. The lads are doing a great job but for how long. Signed Lovenkrands. Loans, Simpson and a name that I can't even pronounce, I won't even try to write it. But if he scores we're buggered for a chant. I just hope that we get some more loans in quick. I don't give a ffffflip if Ashley doesn't sell. He just has to realise that he has a nice little earner here if he handles it right.\r\n\r\nGod (or somebody) save the Toon."
