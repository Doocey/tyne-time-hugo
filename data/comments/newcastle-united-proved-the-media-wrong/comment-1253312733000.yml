message: "\"Although we donâ€™t need the the Carling Cup, the cup means everything to the loyal fans.\"\r\n\r\nNo it doesn't. Getting out of the Championship, having a fit full sqaud that takes us out of the Championship and into the Premier League means everything to loyal fans. Knocking the sh*t out of Sunderland in a derby is what matters to loyal fans. Not playing in the Carling Cup with a paper thin squad who can't take or handle anymore injurys. Without reenforcements and the Carling Cup you will see us start to drop by November and drop like a brick.\r\nBeing where we belong is what matters to loyal fans."
