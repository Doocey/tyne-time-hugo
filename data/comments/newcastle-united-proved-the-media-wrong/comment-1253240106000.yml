  I'm not getting carried away, far from it. But we have proved the critics
  wrong and the lads deserve some praise.

  A depleted squad, an interim manager and a careless owner. Not too bad you
  have to say.


  Although we don't need the the Carling Cup, the cup means everything to the
  loyal fans.
