  Cover for routledge? Why coz he was such a big influence on the team? No we've
  got players that can 'cover' that gem - jonas, Taylor, gosling, abeid, Guthrie
  etc... Prioriority for me is left back. I'd be tempted to make a cheeky bid
  for bassong who is out of favour and can cover lb and cb. A striker won't
  arrive til we ship one out as they'd be playing for a few each week that were
  never playing.


  No offense to routledge - seems like he's a good lad - but covering him
  definitely isn't important.
