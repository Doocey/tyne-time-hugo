message: "You mentioned last minute signings were no bad thing -like Michael\_Owen, Damien Duff, Albert Luque. \_Personally Owen &amp; Luque were the most expensive players we ever had on a game by game basis and they were both shocking buys. \_Duff was garbage, he was slow when he arrived and never got quicker we did not need a left winger we had zoggy who was improving steadily\_and took on fullbacks, whereas duff never beat a fullback when playing in B&amp;W and his goals to game ratio was pathetic. \_What is wrong with knowing who you want and getting them in before the pre season friendlies start? Bed them in to the side properly........oh yes I forgot that would be too professional for the fat controller and the rest of his crew!"
