message: "We've tried Spain, it didn't work (2 in 20 is crap) so next move IMO is to send him on loan within England and hope he settles somewhere. Loan him out to Middlesbrough next season, keeps him in the region, keeps him in the English style of football and possibly gets him going with goals. \r\n\r\nIf someone like Blackpool get promoted via the play-offs IMO it would definitely be a good idea to loan him out if they'd take him; they'd have nothing to lose but a squad space, so could be a realistic option as no one will buy him, and even taking him for free is questionable due to his reported wages."
