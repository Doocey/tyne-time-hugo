message: "I once had a bit craic with him in a bar in Jesmond when the Toon match was on the sky.  He had been left out the squad, could've travelled but didn't, and was sat getting hammered on his tod instead.  Signing autographs and complaining about how he should be in the team, how unfair it was etc...  \r\n\r\nIf we can recoup Â£2m on him i'd be happy!"
