message: "\"Four managers saw him, four managers did not rate him. Thats good enough for me\"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely right.\r\n\r\nAre we forgetting he admitted to faking an injury to get away??!\r\n\r\nAre we forgetting that whilst everyone else was playing in Scunthorpe on a cold Tuesday night he was skipping the season in Spain?\r\n\r\nNo thanks, should never be allowed back into Benton.\r\n\r\nThe above doesnt take his ability into account...when i've seen him for Racing he's been out of the game and uninterested. \r\n\r\nNo thanks...bye bye"
