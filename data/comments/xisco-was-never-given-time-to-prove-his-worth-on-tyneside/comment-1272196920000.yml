message: "Get shot of him. Never been rated by any manager we had, even Kinnear! Faked injury to get away and is on a fair wage packet.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think he was a victim of circumstance at the time. I think he knew he would never really be accepted and he would be viewed as one of the reasons that started the whole Keegan affair and would always be viewed as a Dennis Wise signing."
