  I do think we have a bit of form for not really giving some of our signings a
  fair chance, whether by not playing them in the first team or playing them out
  of position etc.  Luque and Viana never really got a fair crack of the whip
  either.  A little while ago I made the point on another thread on this site
  that we should not underestimate just how difficult it is for foreign players
  to adapt to playing in a new team in a new league, and living in an unfamiliar
  country with an unfamiliar culture – especially for those that don’t even
  speak the language.  I’ve often wondered whether NUFC do enough to help a new
  player to settle - I suspect probably not.
