  Four managers saw him, four managers did not rate him. Thats good enough for
  me. If these four in Keegan, Hughton, Shearer and Kinnear saw him day in day
  out in training and couldn't even give him a place on the bench then the
  question of whether we should have him in the PL shouldn't even be asked! Get
  a million or so and move on...
