  If Liverpool or any other team really wanted him he would of been away in the
  summer , as for the get out clause for 7.5 million ,how do the rags know it
  can still be activated ? well they dont . The only people that know whats in
  that clause is the player his agent and the men in charge at NUFC , maybe it
  could only be activated in the last transfer window and maybe only by a team
  in the CL . The fact is anyway the player himself has never once said he wants
  out .
