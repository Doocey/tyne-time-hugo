  Please no!

  Im norwegian and hope we some day may sign a norwegian. But for us to sign
  John Carew would be a disaster. He is injury prone, lazy and would definitely
  NOT be a good role model for Ranger. Yes his morale is quite good as he hasnt
  killed, raped or knocked out anybody. At least not for a few years now...


  His work rate is below average and he is becoming a bit like sholadinho. 20
  offsides per match, needs 5 chances to score, and make something spectacular
  now and then.


  No please - stay well clear
