message: "Much as I agree that at his peak he was a good player, good, not great, he has always been hampered by injury and has a questionable attitude. You have to ask why he went on loan when Villa were in a relegation battle and hardly banging in the goals, only to sit on the bench at Stoke. I think we may well see him depart these shores to try his hand at winning something in Norway, Reo-Coker features on the same page as Danny Guthrie and Ruel Fox in the Guide to Mediocre Football Players!\_ "
