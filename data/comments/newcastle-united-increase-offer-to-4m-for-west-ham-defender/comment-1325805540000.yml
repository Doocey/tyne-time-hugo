  Good to hear.



  If football was only like that! Should the right money come in for Tomkins,
  he's off!

  It's all good and well being a passionate fan of the team you play for, like
  Andy Carroll was, but the people around him will have a part to play in any
  move he makes.


  All I'm saying - we haven't heard the last of this yet!
