message: "I read through your article twice, but it's already out of date because we've rejected the new £4m bid.\n\nI just can't take this article seriously, when I read \_this:\n\"Either way, Tomkins isn’t expected to be a West Ham player by the end of January, with West Ham trying to get the best price they can for one of their main performers of the season so far\"\nWhy isn't he expected to remain at West Ham?\n\nWe will almost certainly go up with him in the side. We'll probably go up regardless. He isn't for sale, hasn't handed in a request and is being offered a new five-year deal. Doesn't sound like someone we're \"trying to get the best price\" for, does it?"
