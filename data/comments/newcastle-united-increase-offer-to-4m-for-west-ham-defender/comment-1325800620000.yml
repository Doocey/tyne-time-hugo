  You're right.

  Difference is, Rooney went to Manchester United, Carroll went to Liverpool.


  Newcastle, with all due respect, are not in the same class.


  If Tomkins goes, it will be to the Spuds.


  It certainly won't be Newcastle, especially if they're only offering Â£4m, and
  that's their third offer!
