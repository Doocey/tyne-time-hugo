  This guy has his motives, yes. His lass is from the North East so thats one I
  suppose, money is another motive, I think thats safe to say. However Im one of
  those supporters who if a player turns down my club in the past then I wouldnt
  want him here now that it suits him. I believe we were after im before he
  joined Pompy, then again when he joined Notts County. He saw fit to turn us
  down twice because he had his own agenda (Money) but all of a sudden he's
  itching to join us? No Thanks Sol, jogg on son!
