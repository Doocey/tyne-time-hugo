message: "It doesn't matter what his motives are, he brings experience, quality, leadership and will add depth to our squad. Of course we should go for him on a free. We aren't in a position to be picky. If we break down and assess the motives for most in and outs then im sure you will find that 95% of these transfers have money at the core. That is the world we live in. We are currently a Championship side playing awful football with top management that don't give a toss about us. We should count ourselves lucky that ANY player wants to join us at the minute. \r\nSign him up, if it works, fantastic. If it doesn't then we move on.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is very unfair to blame him for Notts County's loss on his debut. You could see he was trying to lead the defence, but those piss poor players simply didn't get it. One man cannot make a four man defence. As Bassong proved last season, and Beye the season before."
