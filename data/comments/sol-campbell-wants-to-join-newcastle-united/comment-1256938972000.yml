message: "I think that we should learn from mistakes of the past few seasons and stay away from the big egoed 'in it for the money players'. Last season Bassong was our best player, this season its Smith and Enrique, so i think we should stick to the motivated youngsters and the never say die sort of players. Thats what this league requires. \r\n\r\nCampbell didnt get relegated so wont have a point to prove, he will play thinking hes too big for this. However, we need another centre back in as Simpson and Khiz are not very good together and Taylor and Colo stuttering with their returns."
