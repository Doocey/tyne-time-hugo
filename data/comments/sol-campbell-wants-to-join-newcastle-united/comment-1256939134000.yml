message: "Dragonera....the thing is he will require high wages for this league and i cant see Sol accepting a short term contract. Next season when hopefully in the premiership he will usut be a waste of space getting ample wages in the reserves or bench. \r\n\r\nI would prefer killgallon on lower wages and with a bright future. But that requires money Mr Ashley!"
