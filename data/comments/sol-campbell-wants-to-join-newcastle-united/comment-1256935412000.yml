message: "Totally agree with Dondatta13, he's only in it for the money &amp; we don't need those sort of players in our squad, especially at 34yrs old, he's had his day, time to move on me thinks!!!\r\n\r\nIn his day he was a good solid defender but why would we take on a 34yr old, when would he play, who would he replace unless either Tayls or Colo got injured, he's too slow now &amp; should have stayed at Notts just for his pension fund!"
