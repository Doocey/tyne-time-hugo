  Well it's hard to know really.

  He has made mistakes like saying we were getting John Arne Riise, Jermain
  Pennant and even Elano.

  He has on occasions had the news before they've reached the papers though,
  like Calderwood's appointment.

  He keeps reiterating that Given will leave, although it is obvious enough.

  Will be interesting to see see whether he will write again
