message: "\_The problem with writing this sort of headline is that it appears to \nToon fans or at least this site that if Tiote was sold there are \"plenty\n more fish in the sea\" !\n\n\n\nYou say \"Cheik is still very much a work in progress but certainly has the \nquality to be one of the best defensive midfielders in the world\".\n\n\n\nHowever I believe that Cheick Tiot√© is one of the top three defensive midfielders in Europe, \n\nnot far away from Sergio Busquets et al. So fans need\n to understand that and then appreciate how difficult it would be to \nfind a genuine replacement for him. In addition to which if Cheick left \nfor another BPL team we'd improve them at our expense which is not what a\n \"Top Four\" team does.\n\n\n\n\nBy all means jettison the less talented squad members but if you want\n to build a team, capable of taking on and beating the very best in \nEurope, then Tiote has to be \"ring fenced\" and kept at this club for the\n rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
