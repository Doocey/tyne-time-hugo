message: "We need Lovenkrands back but as we have an away game coming up and he only likes scoring at home I am not too fussed. Routledge is the other must have. Having him on the wing has given Guthrie the chance to play inside revealing his true talent and given our game much more flow. Pancrate has played well as a sub and I think either he or r.taylor should be given a start at right wing. I'd give Taylor a start and replace him with Pancrate if not performing.\r\n\r\n................Harper\r\nSimps......Will....Collo....Van\r\nTayor...Nolan..Smith...Guthrie...Jonas\r\n...............Carroll"
