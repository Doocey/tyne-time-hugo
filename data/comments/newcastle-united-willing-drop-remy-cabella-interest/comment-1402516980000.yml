  The minutes on the pitch at the World Cup will dictate his price, personally I
  cannot see him playing a lot, as he would have been picked to the original
  squad if the manager value him above others.

  As soon as the World Cup is over or France on way home, the Clown of
  Montpelier will keep his cards to his chest, Ashley is a natural gambler and
  he will be not the one to flinch first, so it down to time and if Cabella is
  as it seems favouring a move to Newcastle there will be not much that the
  Clown can do.
