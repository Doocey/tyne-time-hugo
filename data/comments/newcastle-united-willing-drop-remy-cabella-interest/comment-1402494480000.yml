  hard to say whats going on here, that montpel president is a full blown clown
  from what i an gather and he's clearly nod adverse to clowning around and
  wasting peoples time. he's looking for top dollar, but who can blame him.
  still you are right, ashley should have signed him on day1 of transfer
  re-open, now not getting the deal done appears to have cost us and the fans.
  another indication to us that ashley likes his cash more than his football
  clubs loyal fans. 

  someone should run him over. accidents happen all the time dont they.
