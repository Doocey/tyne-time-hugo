  Would have to think - in our experience of NUFC in the transfer market under
  Mike Ashley - that Newcastle are refusing to budge on their valuation, and
  should Montpellier shift the goalposts (price) yet again, then the deal is
  likely to be off.



  I'm not too confident of Cabella wearing Black and White next season.
