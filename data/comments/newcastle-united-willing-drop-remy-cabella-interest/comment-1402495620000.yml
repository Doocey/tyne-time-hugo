  I actually wouldn't be overly angry if we dropped the interest, more or less
  due to the fact that their owner hates us ever since yanga mbiwa joined and I
  doubt they have any intention of selling to us and will continue to raise the
  price to dick us around until another club comes in and pays what he's
  actually worth. Better to drop out now than put anymore effort into signing
  someone that won't be allowed to join us.
