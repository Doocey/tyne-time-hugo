  Not a palace supporter just stating facts. Their 1st half went too well for
  them to be relegated they were predicted to be in Europe until they were hit
  with injuries. 


  Their overall squad is great and talented hence why they beat you 5-1 before
  Christmas. Then they were hit with the injuries and started losing pretty much
  all their games.
