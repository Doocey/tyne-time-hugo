  Porciestreet; My impression is to bring in both PEA and Biglad and have Cisse
  as third choice striker. We need another collocini  type C/H and a midfield
  general who will command that area and bark at the players when required to do
  so , someone to be scared of and respected at the same time.  This position
  has been lacking since Garry speed  left and boy do we need it.
