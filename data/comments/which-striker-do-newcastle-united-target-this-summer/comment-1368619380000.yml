  Andy Carroll all day long he loves the club and will help balance the teams
  dressing room. he's a local lad and a real handful. there would be no risk
  element. I think Aubamayang is a great talent hes quick and a great finisher.
  I do think he will have interest from other clubs so we may struggle to tempt
  him. One player I believe we should really consider is wigans Kone. he's
  proved a very good center forward this season. a proven premiere league
  goalscorer and may be available quite cheap and a low salary.
