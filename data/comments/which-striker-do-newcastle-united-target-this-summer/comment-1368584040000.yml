  I certainly feel wilfried Bony and Peter Odemwingie should be top contenders
  for Newcastle attacking options. They both have pace and are goal scoring
  threats. Odemwingie will be available for a reasonable price in the summer
  transfer window and NUFC should take the opportunity to bring him in.
