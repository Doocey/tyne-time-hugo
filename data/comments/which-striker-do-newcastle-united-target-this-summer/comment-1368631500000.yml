  I know why Pardew said what he said about losing 4 - 0 to Arsenal. Mike Ashley
  is a Gooner and he has probably made it clear to Pardew that he wants
  Newcastle to lose on Sunday what ever happens. Mark my words, Newcastle will
  have an off day Sunday and will be beat on our last home game of the season.
