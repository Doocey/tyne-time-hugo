  Roberto Martinez for manager.


  Wilfried Bony over Andy and Aubameyang anyday as bony has the size, pace and a
  very good goal scoring record.

  We could do with both bony and aubameyang but it will never happen and for the
  price of andy carroll.... local or not there is much better on the market
  around that price.
