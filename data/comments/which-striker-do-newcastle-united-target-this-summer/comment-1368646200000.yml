  Aubameyang is awesome proper goal scorer and he gets just as many assist as
  goals, a player that isn't greedy. I could see a great partnership between
  aubameyang and cisse. Saying that cisse is inconsistent of late and maybe more
  of a super sub. Would like to see Carroll back, don't know many more if any
  better in the air, put that ball in the box and 90% of the time it's his.
  Ideally for me I would like to see a much more attacking team smarter team
  passing well, with maybe 3 strikers aubameyang Carroll and cisse. As villa
  play but obviously smarter and much better defensive areas.
