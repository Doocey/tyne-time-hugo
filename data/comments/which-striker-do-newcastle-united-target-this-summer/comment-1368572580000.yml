  I would like us to go all out for Aubameyang. Bringing Andy 'Judas' Carroll
  back will only make us keep playing LONG BALL as you have mentioned.  WE NEED
  PACE and Aubameyang has that in abundance. Pace opens up spaces and scares the
  hell out of defenders, we've missed that ever since we sold Bellamy.
