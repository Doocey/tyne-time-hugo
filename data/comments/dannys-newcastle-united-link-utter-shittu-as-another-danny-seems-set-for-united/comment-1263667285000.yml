message: "Nobby Solano training with 1st team……………..\r\nJust got back from taking my son to football training at Northumbria Uni at Coach Lane, one of the other parents went to NUFC training ground prior to attending his son’s training and saw Nobby.\r\nI promise you all that this is not a wind up.\r\nMaybe they are looking at an alternative to the Simpson deal which appears dead.\r\nPersonally I would have Nobby back as he could offer cover in midfield as well as RB."
