message: "CH making excuses about our wage bill already?  It seems to me that all reported signings (Beckford,Simpson etc) are all dead in the water. He thinks our wage bill is bad now?? Just wait and see what happens to the club if we don't go up this season. Surely the money for Beckford and Simpsons wages are a snall gamble for proven Championship players who IMO will help up out of the league.\r\n\r\nPrepare for another 12/13 days of stupid rumours, then a rushed loan deal for some out of form and/or unfit premier league journey man.  If we can only make loan signings how about Vladimir Weiss from City or Kevin Phillips from Birmingham?  Do we really think Kevin Nolan will get another 11 goals in the second half of the season?  Ameobi, Carrol AND Ranger only have 12 league goals BETWEEN them.  Surely by letting Geremi go for nowt should free up enoughh cash to sign Beckford and Simpson??"
