message: "Doocey,\r\nWe will end up with no one signing, the ball is in Simpson's court. I will wager that we have offered more than he is currently on at MUFC, if he is so keen to come to us then surely there is room for negotiation i.e give him an increase on condition of promotion. No doubt his dirty agent will tout him about, interestingly though his previous loan clubs, i,e Mackems/Ipswich/Blackburn never offered him a contract.\r\nHis distribution is awful too."
