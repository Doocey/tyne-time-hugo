  Cant see anything mind blowing happening here. The club needs at least 4 or 5
  qaulity first teamers. You could flog on a few of our crap players for a few
  mil, but ashley is just not the type to fork out silly money. unless its a
  bargain or free - no major news here Im afriad. He will have to get some
  players in, otherwise its relegation next season and that will cost him more
  than it would to bring in a few half decents on the cheap like goufran

  a least a manager like moyes would get them fighting with a bit of team
  spirit, which is more than pardew is capable of getting.
