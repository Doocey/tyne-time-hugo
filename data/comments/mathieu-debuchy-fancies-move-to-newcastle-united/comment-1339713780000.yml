  Yes, this would be a world class back four. With Anita being able to replace
  Tiote when the dreaded A.C.N. comes around yet again I think some shrewd
  thinking is going on . Versatility is key with the little funds we have . The
  fact that a certain Douglas has been quoted as saying " a bigger club" was
  looking at him took the shine of for me . If we are not a big club to him then
  I wouldn't want him . I have scouted Luik de Joong as much as I can on various
  Internet sites and if Demba wants to go then I would be ecstatic .
