  Its true what Kinnear is saying. He needs the backing of Mike Ashley and the
  fans, who seem to be blaming him for every bad result. You have to wonder
  though why we always get so many injuries, is it anything to do with the
  training facilities? Because if it is then surely it would be good to sort
  these out, because it is costing us big time. It is such a shame what has
  happened to Newcastle, only a few years ago we were in the Champions League,
  and what Charles N'Zogbia said is right, eight managers in six years is far
  too much, you have to wonder how unsettling this is for the players.


  And if you ever want a hand writing this blog, just give me a shout, and I'll
  help you straight away.
