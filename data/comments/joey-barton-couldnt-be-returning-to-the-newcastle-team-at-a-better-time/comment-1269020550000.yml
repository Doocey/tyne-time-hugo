message: "Dooce\r\n\r\nLets take one game at a time shall we?  \r\n\r\nAs for Joey, he has to earn the right to get a game which means the players already there have to be either injured or loss of form.  \r\n\r\nAt home Hughton is happy to play Nolan and Guthrie, but if he feels a more defensive midfield is needed in away games, he will normally pair Nolan with either Smith or even Butt, so as far as I can see, Barton is quite low down on the pecking order.  Also Guthrie's recent form in central midfield is making it extremely hard to drop the lad.\r\n\r\nIF AND WHEN we have ensured our premiership return, then is the time to start experimenting with the team.\r\n\r\nHowever, I want us to fight to the very last game, I would just love it if we can finish the season as the last team to win the Fizzy Pop League."
