  They have Courtois! It won't happen. However much he is offered I don't
  believe he'd be willing to sit on a bench. This is a key moment in his career,
  the Dutchpublic think he should be the international number one but the coach
  still prefers Stekelenburg. He will not be willing to jeopardise the progress
  he's made by not playing. 


  Could he leave if a club offered him stupid money? Of course, but it won't be
  to Chelsea. Will it be this summer? I can't see why - he's been first choice
  only one year, we got him as a17 year old. He must have at least some
  sentiment towards us. I know this doesn't mean much in football anymore but
  this Coupled with the fact we're on the rise and in Europe, I just can't see
  why he'd want to leave.
