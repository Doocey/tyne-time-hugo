message: "I think it's a just paper talk and i really don't think\_ there is any truth behind it, there are 2 clubs we are fighting for 4th 5th &amp; 6th place with and the 2 stories about \"Ba and Krul\" have both come out of those clubs, they are just playing the mind games to try and upset a few of our top players Abramovich and Rednapp are both as bent as each other when it comes down to it, you've made some good points Doocey but I don't think Krul will move just because they have no more chance than us of CL and he would play 2nd fiddle to Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois who will both be ahead of him in the pecking order\n"
