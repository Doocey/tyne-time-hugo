message: "I really like your thinking here. I'm not so sure about the price tag on Santa Cruz but a loan move could be a possibility. After all City let Jo go to Everton so there is a precedent set.\r\n\r\nGotta say i'm not a fan of Bentley at all and wouldn't want him anywhere near St. James'.\r\n\r\nI think Jenas could make a surprise return. Not playing regularly and every Spurs fan I meet seems to think he is a waste of space. I;d take him back in heartbeat."
