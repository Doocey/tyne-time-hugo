message: "id say get seb larsson in, his in contract trouble with birmingham,can play right back too,did so for sweden in the last national fixture and didnt put a foot wrong, sweet right foot and not a diva.\r\n\r\nwatched skjelbred a couple of times,must say i didnt like what i saw, looks slow on the ball and seems to dissapear to often in games.\r\n\r\nsanta cruz will surely be injured a few times during the season and could prove to costly in my opinion.\r\n\r\ndorrans i would like.\r\n\r\noÂ´hara i havent seen play so got no opinion.\r\n\r\nas i am from sweden i would like to see Kallstrom from lyon in CM for newcastle.no nonsense player with great attitude ,powerfull shot and great crosser,always works his socks off."
