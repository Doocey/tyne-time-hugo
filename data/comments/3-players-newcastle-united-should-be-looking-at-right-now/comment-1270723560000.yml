message: "How we fans love wasting Cashley's money, and will then cry foul when these prima donnas lie around injured for 60% of the season before leaving on a free.  Perhaps we needed a second season in the Fizzy to dispel our delusions that had the club stacked up with useless trophy signings?  £8m for Robbie Keane is still £4m too much and utterly inconsistent at that.  Harewood on a free would score more goals.  \r\n\r\nWe need to be MUCH better wheeler-dealers than this, and look very carefully at avoiding the wage spiral that left us virtually crippled in May 2009.  Ask yourself would Arsenal buy any of these players?  Answer NO!!  So why should we?"
