message: "I,ve just been reading some of the players named and shaking my head in disbelief!!!!\r\n\r\nI am not surprised that a lot of opposition supporters call us deluded!\r\n\r\nHave you all learnt nothing from what happened last year? We need players between the ages of 18 and 23 who fit into our salary structure which despite all of their faults i hope Ashley and co are gonna set up for the new season!\r\n\r\nWe don,t need any more 2mln plus signings who are only out to screw us for as much as they can get!\r\n\r\nPlease do what Chris says and take a reality check!!!!"
