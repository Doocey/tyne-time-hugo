  FUCKING DREAMERS MAN I AINT MISSED A GAME THIS YEAR, can one of you take a
  reality check please. O Hara a chance decent player, but the likes of Santa
  Cruz and Bentley way out of our league. The budget that Hughton will have
  won't be much more than 15mill, spurs would want all of that for Hutton and
  Bentley and lets be honest wank deals like that got us relegated. Need more
  deals like routledge and williamson if we are to stay up. If you believe this
  wank please stay away from ST james next year cos yah the part time moaners
  who jump on and off the bandwagon with fancy dan signings. Not proper fans
  like me
