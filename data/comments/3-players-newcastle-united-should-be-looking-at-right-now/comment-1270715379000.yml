  Anyone else think it might be worth on punt on bringing Darren Ambrose back to
  the club? Probably very cheap and a good squad player. I'd also have a look at
  some of Aston Villa's forgotten men - especially Sidwell and maybe even big
  Bruno. No chance of this one but I would love Dorrans from West Brom.
