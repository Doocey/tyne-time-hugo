  how about daniel de ridder? he is a QUALITY player and he would come pretty
  cheap and also a great signing for left back would/could be ricardo gardner
  from bolton he is a quality full back and would provide not only competition
  for enrique but due to his experience could help bring him on even further ive
  always rated him and de ridder and have never understood why de ridder has
  never been mentioned as a transfer target as he would provide us with the
  skills flair and creativity we so desperately need and he fits in with ashleys
  policy of under 26 and his wages would be cheap
