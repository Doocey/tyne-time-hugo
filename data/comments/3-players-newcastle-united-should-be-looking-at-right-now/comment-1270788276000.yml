  It's not a matter of how much the toon will buy players for it's a matter of
  their wages!!!! Robbie Keane would be a good signing but the matter of Â£60-70k
  a week wages is just not viable, the same with Santa Cruz and Bentley..
  Unfortunately them days have passed where we would splash out countless
  amounts of money on transfers and wages. Our club is being ran as a business
  where we aren't gonna sign 28-31yr old players on superstar wages.... The new
  stratergy seems to be signing players under the age of 26 and on wages of less
  than 30k.. For me, I would get Kris Boyd(Rangers), Beckford(Leeds).Both are 26
  and are free transfers in the summer. The likes of Dorrans from West Brom
  could be a good signing. We need a class centre midfielder with lots of
  creativity, unless we have scouts out scouring the world for something in our
  price range, I think we are gonna be stuck with the mediocre none creative
  championship midfield we have at the moment, which is a sad thing to say....
