  we should give tim krul a chance in goal. i think kilgallon from sheff wed
  would be a good signing and would go well with mike williamson. luke young
  right back ? or maybe even rafael on loan? apparently man u are putting him on
  the loan list. ohara good signing central midfield with nolan, jonas and
  routledge on the wings and i think robbie keane would be an excellent signing
  with andy carroll upfront as carroll would team up with someone with good
  positioning such as robbie keane. sell leon best pancrate and loan out ranger.
