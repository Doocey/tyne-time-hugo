message: "First,i'd say that O'hara would be a decent buy,he have potential to improve and he is still young.\r\nSecondly,we should gor for Albin,his contract expires this season and look surely to be a good PL player.\r\nLast i would love to see keane to newcastle as he have a good scoring abillity and think he will cope well with Lovenkrands at the front."
