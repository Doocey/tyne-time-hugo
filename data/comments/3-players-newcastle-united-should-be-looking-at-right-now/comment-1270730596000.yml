  Källström would be great but i think he would cost to much. As a Dane myself i
  have always wondered why there isnt more clubs dipping into the scandinavian
  market. Denmark and Sweden were in group with Portugal and Hungary for the WC
  qual and Denmark finished first and Sweden ended 3rd after pushing portugal
  really good for 2nd. And allot of the players on those international teams
  still play in the Danish or Swedish league. They would cost practically
  nothing and Scandinavian players usually do well in the EPL.
