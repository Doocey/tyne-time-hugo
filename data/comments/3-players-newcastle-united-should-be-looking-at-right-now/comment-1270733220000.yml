message: "I think Källström would be a great signing too. Also Albin could be a good signing, and looking on Wikipedia they suggest Newcastle have already agreed terms with him to join us in the summer.\r\nAlso how about Leonardo Bonucci, the defender from AS Bari, having a great season in Italy and aged only 22\r\nI wouldn't go for Keane, he may give his all and score some great goals - but nowhere near enough, and would cost to much for his age.\r\nI woudn't want Beye back either, as he deserted us when we went down."
