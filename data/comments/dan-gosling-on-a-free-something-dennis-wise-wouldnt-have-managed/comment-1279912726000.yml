  To be fair, you have to feel for Plymouth more than Everton as it was their
  mistake regardless of how the agent and player manipulated the situation. 
  Either way, for the sake of an extra 10k a week, he&#39;s screwed over the two
  clubs who&#39;ve made him what he is today. You&#39;d imagine he agent
  insisted on a low sell on fee too as and when Newcastle get
  relegated....another nice little earner!
