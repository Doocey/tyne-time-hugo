  When Wise was around I doubt you would have signed someone like Gosling
  because you were looking UP at the top-6, not consolidating and attempting to
  survive a relegation threat. <br><br>What you have with Gosling is a decent
  low-level PL or good Championship player. You have no more, or less than
  that.<br><br>Some Newcastle fans need to wake up and stop making out like
  you&#39;ve pulled off a coup. You&#39;re paying this lad over the odds (25k a
  week) simply because he was free. He has never been rated highly by
  Evertonians, although he was celebrated for scoring that goal against
  Liverpool.<br><br>If all goes to plan at Newcastle, Gosling will be a squad
  player at best in a couple of seasons. If you get relegated again (which you
  probably won&#39;t), then he&#39;ll presumably push for a first team place,
  while picking up his 25k a week.<br><br>What upset Everton fans was losing him
  for nothing. Someone cocked up, and we lost a potential fee. Like you
  we&#39;re skint, and the Â£1.5-2m we might have got for him, would have made a
  difference.<br><br>But honestly, you&#39;re welcome to him.
