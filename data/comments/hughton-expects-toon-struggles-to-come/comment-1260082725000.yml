message: "Hey Doocey, since Ed closed his blog I'm having some problems to find links in which I can watch Newcastle's games, especially when the match is happening at the same time of several others. \r\n\r\nI realize that with Newcastle playing the CCC it's being more difficult to find video streams, but sometimes I can't even find radio ones - as it happened today - because, for example, BBC restricts the stream to the North East. \r\n\r\nI'd be glad if you could help me on this. \r\nThanks."
