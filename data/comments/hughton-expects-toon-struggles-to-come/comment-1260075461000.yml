message: "Another great result today and a stunning debut goal by Pan \"Karate\" Kid, just waiting to catch it again on the footy league show.\r\n\r\nAs far as expecting more difficult games, I'm sure we'll get them but at the same time we're getting injured players back. Nolan suspended is a downer but we should have enough to cover. Upuntil his sending off Nolan had played every minute of every league game so far this season!\r\n\r\nPan \"Karate\" Kid could sure turn into a crowd pleaser :)"
