  Im actually both a Sk Brann and Newcastle fan, im from Sk Branns homwtown
  Bergen in Norway. I can tell you guys that Erik Huseklepp wants to move
  abroad, and he has a clause in his contract which says that he can leave the
  club if a bid in the region of 2-3 million pounds is on the table. I think
  that he would be a very good signing for us. He has played on the right hand
  side of the midfield for Brann earlier, both he was played as a striker last
  season and was probably the best player in the Norwegian League last season.
  He is a real entertainer, with bags of pace and skills.
