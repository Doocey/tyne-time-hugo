  huseklepp is a good shout but chelsea is were he wants to go he has said it
  himself.. I am all for Vegar Eggen Hedenstad 2-3m and the same for skelbred
  they both are nufc fans and will play for the shirt not the cash.. I also feel
  huseklepp is a winger so wont get many games unless wayne doesn't cut it in
  prem.. Not sure who to buy upfront need goals id say vaughan from everton he
  has big point to prove or vela for same reason.. also KP Boetang as i really
  like this player he looks good on the ball and is strong in the mid.. As for
  cb id have Yobo or Wheater if wants out of the fizzypop.. what do you guys
  think of this poss players as well as o'hara..
