  Can anyone tell me why we aint got skelbred yet he is a nufc fan and will play
  his socks off for us so why isnt there any news saying were interested in one
  of the young talents available to us i would also like haris to play a more
  involved role next year as i fear he will leave if we dont.. Ive also heard a
  while back we were looking at a norway young defender meant to be really good
  why aint heard on that as well.. I think this new policy will back fire as we
  wait to long and they get snapped up by arsenal and man utd shame as they seem
  like good buys and i think will do well for our first team..
