  None of the local papers in Bergen are reporting this today. However it was
  reported three months ago. Erik is a very talented CF, but I'm afraid he'd be
  to much of a lightweight in the PL. His style would probably fit more in Seria
  A or something. Skjelbred on the other hand would be a great investment.
  Newcastle need new midfielders this season, no?
