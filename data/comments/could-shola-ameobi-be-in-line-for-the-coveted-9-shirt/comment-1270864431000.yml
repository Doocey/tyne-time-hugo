  Our most consistant and naturally talented striker, went fit and playing a run
  of games he has always scored goals. He had excellent spells under Robson and
  Roeder as well as scoring in several games against the Makems....have any of
  the others scored in games at Nou Camp, Semi Final vs Man Utd and other
  Champions League away goals vs Leverkusen?! No, his goal to (started)games
  ratio is very good, if any of them get the 9, is MUST be him
