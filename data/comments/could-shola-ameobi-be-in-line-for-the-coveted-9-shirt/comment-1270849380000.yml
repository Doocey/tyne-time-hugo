  I think the 9 shirt has a strange pressure that comes with it, it would be
  wrong to go into the Premiership and give it to one of our current strikers.
  Nothing against them, I just think Carroll is too young to carry that burden
  and Shola isn't consistent enough in the Premiership. He's a fan favourite for
  sure, but we need someone that can take it on and be inspired by it rather
  than for it to be a burden on them.
