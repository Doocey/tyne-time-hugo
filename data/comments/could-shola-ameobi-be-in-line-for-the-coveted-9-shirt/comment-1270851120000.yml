  I think the number 9 shirt should be left in the dressing room for next year.
  The No.9 shirt needs to be earned and not just given. so lets see who fairs
  the best in the prem next year and base it on that. whoever gets it (if
  earned) will have my full backing and most of the fans. Be it Ameobi, carroll,
  or ranger. Just as long as they are proved worthy of the shirt
