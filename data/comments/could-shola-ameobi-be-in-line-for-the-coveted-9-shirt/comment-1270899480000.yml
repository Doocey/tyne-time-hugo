message: "I still cannot believe i have read some articles that actually praise this guy. Time and time again Ameobi fails to deliver. Sure, like anyone if he is given enough opportunities he will grab a goal but for me he is far too inconsistent. For someone who has shown touches of brilliance this makes it all the more frustrating and i'm sorry but 41 goals in over 200 appearances is not a good goal to game ratio! It's laughable to even think it is.\r\nPlus he's always injured but thats another matter."
