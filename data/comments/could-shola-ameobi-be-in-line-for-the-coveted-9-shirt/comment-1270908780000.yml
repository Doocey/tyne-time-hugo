  Red Mag,Shola's goal scoring record, when put in the context that almost 40%
  of his appearances have come off the bench [204app/76sub], does not look that
  bad.Granted his injuries are a concern but if [again granted big if]he stays
  fit and gets a good run he'll do a job.As Heavenfire says some people seem to
  prefer headless chickens, running around with no end product.Time to stop
  getting on the lads back.
