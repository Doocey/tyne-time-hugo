  Those on here thinking he isn't good enough should remember he will and the
  other strikers will only get goals if they are supplied right we have had no
  creativity in the mid for a while so why would expect anyone to get 30-40
  goals we also haven't been playing like a team for a while but now i feel we
  are maybe we still need that killer pass but with this lad will score 20-25
  goals a season he defo has the ability to be a better than average player not
  torres or rooney but defo a decent finisher none the less hope we do get that
  missing link in the mid then we should be ok with backup for other positions
  rb/lb/mr/ml.
