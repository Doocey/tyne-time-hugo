  Does anyone think oba martins back would be great with the wingers we have
  working well now his pace would scare all defences and with big andy to do the
  knock ons hell score a bucket load anyway i dont think nufc will even think of
  bring him back but i for 1 would to see what he could do with the team we now
  have solid at the back maybe lack that creative mid so hopefully that will get
  sorted soon i also hope we sign kp boetang he looks like a real star in the
  making...
