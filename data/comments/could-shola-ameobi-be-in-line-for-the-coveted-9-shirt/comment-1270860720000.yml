message: "Ha Gary.. love it. \"shola has found his level in the CCC league\"... sigh .. you prat. \r\n\r\nHe can't win Shola. He has added moment of genuine prem class to niggling CCC standard games every time he's played and notched up 10 in 10 starts. If EVER there was a player that looked too good for this league it was shola this season.\r\n\r\nYes, loven and carroll are in form - but are also unilateral players, specialising in one area,, playing off defender's shoulders and target man respectively. Shola remains our best all-round forward,, so is the closest we have to a no.9.\r\n\r\nI suspect Hughton will bring in an experienced finisher - along the lines of Bent, Rodallega or Pavlichenko."
