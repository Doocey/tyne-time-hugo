message: "I think Shola is not a number 9. He is very much a confidence and fitness player. When given a run of injury free games he has always scored goals.\r\n\r\nNot a world beater and far too injury prone but still has a knack of scoring goals and is worth keeping as a squad player. I'd rather flog Best first!"
