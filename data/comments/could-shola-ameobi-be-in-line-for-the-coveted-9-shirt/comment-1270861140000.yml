message: "Anyways Doocey - good article, good to see someone thinking for themself and not just ganning with 'shola's a donkey' yada, yada.\r\n\r\nFrom where I was sitting last monday, Shola added a touch of class for the 8 mins he was on. He still looks like he's improving as a finisher at 28 and I'd hate to loose him now. Possibly looks our most technically gifted forward. He could score 15 next season and prats like Gary would still say he should go- some people were born daft and never change I suppose."
