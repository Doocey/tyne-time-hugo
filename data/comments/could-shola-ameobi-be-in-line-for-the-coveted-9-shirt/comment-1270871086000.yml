  Boater (9.52pm) brings sense to a blinkered debate. Why oh why do Magpies fans
  insist on having players whose primary gift is to run like headless chickens?
  I think Shola's a worthy No.9 who, if anything, has been weakened by the
  insistence on trying to mold him into a new 'Mary Poppins'. If Ameobi had been
  given trust and games after his Barcelona performance, he'd have been top
  class. Still, his goals to games ratio justifies (imho) selection and the
  shirt to go with it.
