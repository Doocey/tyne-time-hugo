  True but you'd think he'd no better than mess around with the club and it's
  fans. Obviously he doesn't realise or simple doesn't care about Newcastle
  anymore. The longer it goes on though, the harder it's hitting the fortune he
  has remaining so for that reason we have to assume that he's selling the club
  or doing his utmost. Then again assume does mean a couple of things.
