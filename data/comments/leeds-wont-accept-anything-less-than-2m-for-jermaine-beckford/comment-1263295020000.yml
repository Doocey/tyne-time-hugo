Look at Owen, the guy was finished when he left Liverpool imo. Has Capello for example, ever been remotely bothered? Yet he comes to newcastle for £17M or something in 2005 just to get injured. Look at the situation now, half the geordie public are calling for us to sign Jermaine Beckford, based on 20 LEAGUE ONE goals and a goal against a patched up Man U defense. The same Man U that struggled to get a 1-1 draw against birmingham the other day. The guy is available on a FREE in the summer, on top of that apparently his attitude stinks and he spurns most his chances. Sounds like he would be well out his depth in the premier league, yet ppl will still get p off with Ashley when he doesnt pay rediculously over the odds for him. If Villa and Sunderland are interested in signing him, why hasnt he gone to any of these clubs? £2M is nothing to a prem team. Coz its utter rubbish thats why.\r\nThere are so many better PROVEN forwards we could go for, Boyd, mcdonald, sharp, hooper, ect all these players are proven, some internationals, at a higher level than beckford and most are  down to earth and would probably give their right arm to sign for newcastle. We have to stop looking at the Names signings and start making some intelligent signings."
