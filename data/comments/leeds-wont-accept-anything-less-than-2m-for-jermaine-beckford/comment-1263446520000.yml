  Newcastle looks Jermaine's best bet, I reckon 4 million would be a price
  Grayson might consider for an early move,we have to replace him after all.
  What he has in abundance is pace, pace, pace. He tries for flashy cool
  finishes all the time, look the business when they come off but all too often
  they don't. He is still learning and improving however, less lazy than he used
  to be and overall game developing well. The sheer pace always worries opposing
  defences. We'll have to change our tactics a bit if and when he goes, but
  still very confident of automatic promotion although I've a nagging suspicion
  that Norwich might pip us for the title, they are a classy outfit by this
  league's standards and on a roll.
