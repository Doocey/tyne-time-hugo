  lets remember it was mike ashley who shelled out over 2 million quid for xisco
  and what a waste of money that proved to be??? surely beckford is worth the 2
  million pound gamble as he is a raw talent who is full of pace something which
  our newcastle side is severly lacking at the minute and an asset which will be
  needed to continue our promotion charge.
