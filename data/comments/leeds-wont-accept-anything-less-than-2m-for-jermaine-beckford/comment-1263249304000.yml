  iam a leeds fan and have seen 90%of beckfords goals scored live and although
  his goal tally looks impressive lots of strikers who have had the chances he
  has had would have a better goal ratio he misses lots more than he scores .he
  looses his head easily if he misses an early chance and sometimes he tries
  something he shouldnt when a simpler touch would produce a goal. if beckford
  goes we have been linked with players HOOPER.MCLEAN and others who have 
  abetter goal ratio than beckford it makes you wonderwhy a team picks  a player
  and why aren,t  newcastle looking at these players ?? beckford falls into the
  category of very good players who just are not good enough for premier league
  like one of our explayers  alan "smudge" smith who is the same but not sadly a
  premier league player trust me i saw all his games he has been relegated twice
  as iam on a newcastle forum i would like to say good luck to newcastle and
  their fans hope ypu get promoted you are a great club
