  while 2mil may seem a lot as hes out of contract in june, would it now be
  worth paying 2mil if his goals will get us promoted? 2mil for promotion is a
  small price to pay. And before anyone starts sayin he wont cut it, he has a
  better touch than shola, better finisher than shola and more pace, and shola
  has scored his fair share in this league. Even if we paid 2mil for him now
  just to get us promoted, he may not cut it in the prem but we can soon sell
  him on and get our money back
