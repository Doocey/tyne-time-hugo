message: "\"Look at the situation now, half the geordie public are calling for us to sign Jermaine Beckford, based on 20 LEAGUE ONE goals and a goal against a patched up Man U defense. The same Man U that struggled to get a 1-1 draw against birmingham the other day\"\r\n\r\nDJG, you must not watch much League 1 football mate. Its not just 20 goals in League 1, its the fact he has notched 64 goals in 93 starts, has pace to burn and is the most prolific goal scorer in England today, FACT. You might say Man U are a poor team but they are a damn sight better than the likes of Scunthorpe, Peterborough etc who we need him to score against. Â£2m is gamble worth making to get us out of the Championship, if he doesn't score in the PL sell him back to a Champoinship club at a profit!  He does huff sometimes after being subbed but he's a model pro off the pitch.  After handing in a transfer request last season, he still got his head down and notched another 20 odd goals.  As for Sharp and Hooper, your having a laugh mate, Beckford is twice the striker.  If Beckford doesn't score in the PL Sharp and Hooper have no chance.  Boyd and McDonald WOULD be a suitable plan B, although I doubt we could get either for 2m.  You are saying we need to make intelligent, proven signings.  What more does Beckford have to do??"
