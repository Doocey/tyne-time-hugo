message: "If you want a player rated by people within the game then you pay the asking price. It doesn't really matter when his contract's up. Bear in mind when talking about the fee that you've to add an additional mill for Beckford. He would get it as a free contract player in June so believe me, it will be a condition of him signing for a club now. \r\n\r\nTo my mind it would pay Beckford to wait till June to see which of his suitors are in the Prem next season."
