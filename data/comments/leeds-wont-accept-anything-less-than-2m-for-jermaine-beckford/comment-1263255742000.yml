  Giles Barnes?? Does the author of this blog not follow football???  Do you
  even know why he is on a free??  Or why he went on loan to Fulham and didn't
  get a game?  Derby County are the worst team to play at SJP this season and
  they released him.  Switch on fella, your embarrassing yourself.  The guy is
  one injury away from retirement.
