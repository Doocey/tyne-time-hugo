  Whoever posted under the name Beckfords Nuts above is talking rubbish. 
  Beckford himself has said barely anything publicly in all the time he's been
  at Leeds, as far as I recall has had one publicly stroppy moment and has a
  fantastic goalscoring record.  He also ran more than five yards for the Man U
  goal (and most of his others).  As for him having a massive ego - not unknown
  to footballers is it?  And so what if he has?  self-belief is important in
  fottball.  Whether he would make it in the premier league I don't know but I
  am pretty certain he's more than good enough for the championship.  As a Leeds
  fan I don't want him to go but if he does I wish him well
