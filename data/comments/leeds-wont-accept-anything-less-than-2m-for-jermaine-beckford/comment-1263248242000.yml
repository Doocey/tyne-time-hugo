  anyone else think that scott mcdonald would be a great buy.id prefer to fork
  out d extra cash , and not too much more for a expeienced striker.ive always
  liked him for celtic and he didnt even start d old firm d last day , came on
  nd scored. would be a great buy and i think would also be able to do it wen
  were back in the premier league aswell next year
