message: "SB says:\r\nÂ£2million for a player out of contract in June, little championship experience &amp; no premier league experience- are Leeds having a laugh?\r\n\r\nFFS.  Have you had your head up yer arse for the last year?\r\n\r\nLeeds don't wan't to sell.  Leeds don't need to sell.  Time and time again SG has said that only a silly offer will sufice.  It's the same old vultures trying to grab a bargain that are having a laugh.  Only this time the seller ain't desperate."
