message: "Yes Halfords mate, very true, I've watched Newcastle around 14 games this season, to say they have had a fair few soft penalties and a very good run of luck too, would be an understatement, tonights game was no exception, very soft penalty after Carrol was blatently shouldering  Murphy in the back, seen by mr bias (Peter Beagrie) as \"shoulder to shoulder\".\r\nSorry Geordie fans but the way some of your players go down like \"sacks of spuds\" after getting challenged is diabolical, especially as this season you have developed \"stoke\" syndrome, shove, pull, kick, barge people off the ball and then cry when it happens to you, Roman Bednars yellow card at St James is a prime example after he was brutalalised by Steven Taylor only for 40 odd thousand geordie boys saying he chopped Taylor, it was crazy, as Bednar was in possesion.\r\nAnyway, enough grumbling, congratulations on going up, we will be there next week too and I can look forward to getting to some more local games, come on borough lol."
