  As a spurs fan I can say it's probably all about price. He's second choice at
  spurs because, although being great going forward, he's too weak defensively
  to defend behind Lennon but spurs will definately want to get at least half of
  the Â£8m he reportedly cost. If you think he's worth that then he's yours
  because if Potato headed Steve Bruce and 25 year spurs servant go for the same
  player...
