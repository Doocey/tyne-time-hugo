  As another Spurs fan I'd say you're more than welcome to him. He was great in
  Scottish football, but failed to perform in English football. That said, as
  Seb has mentioned, we paid a lot for him, and there's a good reason why we're
  one of the few clubs that run at a profit: we don't let players go on the
  cheap. I reckon between Â£4-5mil and he's yours.
