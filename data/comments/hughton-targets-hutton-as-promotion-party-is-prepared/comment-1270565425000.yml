  Redknapp is up to his old Del Boy tricks again..trying to convince the stupid
  mackems they will need to spend more money to land Hutton.  Doubt Newcastle
  will get involved in a bidding war for such an average player, altho
  apparently the player wants to come as he lives on the quayside (as do most of
  Sunderland's first team)
