  good to finally get this done, should have paid the extra mil or two when we
  sold cabaye and perhaps a higher league finish would have recoupled that loss.
  expect him to be good, but also wouldnt be surprised if he was sold on for
  double his price in 2-3 years, following the ashley vision of the future...
