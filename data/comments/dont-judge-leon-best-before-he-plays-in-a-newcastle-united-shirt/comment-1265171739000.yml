message: "DOOCEY I see what your saying but it doesn't add up from a Cov perspective. We had a better negotiating position than Leeds did with Beckford. We could have kept him till the end of the season and still picked up Â£1million+ off anyone who wanted him. \r\n\r\nAlso why would we sell our number one striker for peanuts with no time left in the transfer window to sign a replacement, unless there was a financial incentive.  \r\n\r\nAnyway good luck for the rest of the season! Van Aanholt is a good lad and should do well for you. I think while we had him though that there was a clause meaning he had to play when he was available, might be the reason why you only have got him for a month."
