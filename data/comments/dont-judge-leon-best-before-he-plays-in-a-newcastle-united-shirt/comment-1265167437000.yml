message: "The fee will almost certainly be around £1.5 million. I'm pretty certain Leon Best was still covered by the tribunal up until the end of this season. \r\n\r\nConsidering we paid Southampton around £1million at the tribunal a couple of seasons back we would at least expect the same again minimum. We also rejected a £3million bid for Westwood on deadline day. This shows that we are only willing to sell at the right price. The chairman is on record at the start of the window saying we wouldn't sell Leon for less than £1.5 to £2million. I see no reason why we would sell unless you matched what we could expect to receive in the summer."
