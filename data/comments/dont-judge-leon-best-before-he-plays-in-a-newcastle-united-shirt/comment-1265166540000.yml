message: "Yeah my mate Llambias and i had to raid my piggy bank for this one and found some loose change in it exactly £625,000 was there and thats all i could afford as i just had my heating bill in for my modest house in bucks for £1.3 million so you can blame e-on for the lack of funds, but hopefully he will do you a good turn and get you back upto the PL, then i can sell the club to someone else, can't wait to get out to be honest (you geordies certainly know how to make someone feel welcome) \r\nnow where did i put my pie??"
