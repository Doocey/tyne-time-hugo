  I saw this guy 3 years ago playing for Bournemouth at Brentford (who were
  strong at home briefly at the time) as a raw 20-yr old loanee from
  Southampton. He was a real handful for the defence - quick, agressive, good
  runs and good vision (I thought). He played in a 442 alongside James Hayter
  who at the time had a much bigger reputation and, for me, excelled him. I'm
  optimistic.
