message: "Kieran there's no way Ashley would have paid that amount of money and as for the tribunal its highly unlikely they'd have set the fee at Â£2m and anyway I believe they are only for players under 23 yrs of age(apologies if I'm wrong).......like the article says give him a chance,he has a better strike rate this season than all our current strikers,playing for a team currently in the bottom half of the league.\r\nWe've signed alot more players then we could have hoped for and only 1 out...the financial drain aka as Geremi.....they may not seem to be of the quality we'd like but lets give them a chance or shall we go back to wasting millions on the likes of Luque and Boomsong???.....HTL"
