message: "Yeh i thought the 650k was abit cheap, thought a million or two is more of a realistic sum. \r\n\r\nAntoine Sibierski was one of the most berated signings and he went on to become abit of a cult hero. Im sure Hughton knows more about the player than the fans who say he's not good enough, so im gona trust the Newcastle manager. \r\n\r\nHe shrugged off Enrique at the Ricoh...may have got abit lucky with it but left me astounded."
