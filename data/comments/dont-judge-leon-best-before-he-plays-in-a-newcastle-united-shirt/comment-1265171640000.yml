message: "If the assumed price of £650K is correct, or even if the correct amount is slightly higher, it's still a bargain if he is capable of scoring 10+ goals per season for us. We have paid a lot more, from £7M to £16M (excluded the medical bills of course), for players who haven't been anywhere near that scoring ratio. Bellamy, Cort, Owen, Viduka (on a free transfer, but consider his wages)... In fact, only Sibierski has been close to that in the last ten years, if you divide total scorings on the amount of seasons at the club, save perhaps Martins (though he couldn't muster a 10 goals per season ratio either).\r\n\r\nMy point; give the lad a chance to shine before breaking him before he's even shown what he can do!!!"
