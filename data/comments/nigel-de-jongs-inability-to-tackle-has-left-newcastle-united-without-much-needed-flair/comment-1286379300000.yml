  Talk about back and white specs ! Or just joining in with the media witch
  hunt?


  Turn the tables and if  De Jong played for you would you be talking all this
  rubbish?

  No, you'd be saying what everyone with half a brain have been saying that is
  was a hard but fair challenge and that it was an unfortunate accident.

  The ref called in exactly right - no it wasn't a foul! He won the ball ! How
  are you supposed to make that sort of challenge carefully? Put some slippers
  on?

  Sorry you've lost a player for 6 months but thats football ffs.
