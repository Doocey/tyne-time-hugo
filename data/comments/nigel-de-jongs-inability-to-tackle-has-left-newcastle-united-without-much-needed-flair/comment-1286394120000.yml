  Hope the lad recovers quickly with no long-term ill effects.


  We all know it is the job of the "hardman" on each team to clatter the
  opposition's best, poncy player in the first five minutes, to quiet him down,
  and get him to sulk for the rest of the game.


  This tactic worked rather well with Elano and Robinho, to name but two recent
  City players, famous for going missing when the going gets tough.


  So why the shock - horror when Dejong does it?


  It's really sad Ben Arfur suffered such a bad injury, but to pretend it's one
  or two players that do this hatchet job in the whole of football is
  hypocritical at best, as we all know just about every team from the Sunday
  League to the World Cup Finals does it. And it's not as if they're not well
  paid to take the risks of serious injury is it?


  Again, I wish HBA a full and speedy recovery, but please can we have some
  perspective?
