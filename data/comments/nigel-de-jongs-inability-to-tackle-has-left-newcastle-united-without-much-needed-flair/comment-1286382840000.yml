  Newcastle was in possession in Manchester City's half - you say looking
  threatening??  Are you suggesting that Newcastle are that sh!te in a
  threatening position that the opposition should just let them get on with it
  rather than making needless tackles upon their players!!!! Get real. 

  Ben Arfas standing leg wasn't able to ride the challenge from De Jongs
  Trailing leg after he had cleanly and fairly won the ball because his studs
  were caught in the turf (Synthetic weaved playing surface). Either that or he
  was on the same school milk as Djbrel Cisse who had a knack of snapping legs
