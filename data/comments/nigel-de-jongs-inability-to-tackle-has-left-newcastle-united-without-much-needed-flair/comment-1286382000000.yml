  The reaction to this unfortunate incident is not consistent with the tackle
  itself.  I ask you, would the tackle have even been mentioned if Hatem Ben
  Arfa had got up and continued the game?  This witch hunt is on because of the
  nature of the injury sustained, that it was De Jong who made the tackle and
  because it adds more hypocritical media hype to anything current  involving
  City.

  Challenges like this one are seen in every premiership game each week.   De
  Jong job is to make tackles and I believe he has the highest tackle/success
  ratio of any  premiership player this season.  The decision of the Dutch
  manager beggars belief considering the way he set out to kick his way to
  victory over Spain in the WCF. 

  Like most genuine City fans, I feel for the kid and I like Newcastle as a club
  but please, don't jump on the media bandwagon and kid yourselves that is was
  anything other than a hard tackle where the ball was there to be won.   Ask
  yourself honestly - if  Barton or Nolan had made the tackle would your
  reaction still be one of disgust and horror?
