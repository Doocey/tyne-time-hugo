  I am a hugh NUFC fan and am absolutly shattered from the injury that wor Benny
  has received, but I don't know how you can say  "Three minutes in, Newcastle
  United with possession and looking threatening" followed by "a needless
  challenge from Nigel de Jong" thus resulting in stopping a 'threatening'
  attack. It was a very bad, almost inexplicable challange that could prove to
  end the career of a player dubbed France's best player of his generation,
  however it was more exsessive and full bodied, rather than ''needless''.


  Here's to a speedy and 100% recovery to HBA. the toon will miss you this
  season
