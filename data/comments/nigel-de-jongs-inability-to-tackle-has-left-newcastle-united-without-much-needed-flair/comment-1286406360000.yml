  You lot are a bunch of sad &amp; biased gets.

  Just wait 'til it happens to one of your players cos it isn't clamped down on
  right now.

  Your pathetic excuses make me sick.

  So it's ok cos he 'won' the ball?

  Or managed to touch the ball, a bit like the 'pen' you got that was outside
  the box?

  I always had a lot of time for manc fans &amp; certainly don't begrudge them
  their new found wealth, always thought is was good that a club like yours got
  the chance to shake up the 'top 4'. After all the crap your club has been
  through in recent years.

  I guess i'll have to reappraise now. Obviously the cash has spoiled you &amp;
  you don't seem to care how you 'win' a game now. A sad reflection on how
  you're playing &amp; what big money does to one's attitude.

  Barton breaks Tevez leg in the next game, fair dinkum then hey?

  Sad sacks.

  It's grim in the north midlands. (manchestoh)
