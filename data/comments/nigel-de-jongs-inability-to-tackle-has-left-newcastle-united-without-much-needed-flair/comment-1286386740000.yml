  the first part of the tackle was fine it was after when his second leg came
  trough that did the damage. and yes as any fan would you are standing up for
  one of your own players. also if it was joey barton everyone would be calling
  for a ban. also it was unfortunate tackles like this shouldn't go unpunished
  even if there isnt an injury. i also like to see hard tackles but it is hard
  to draw a line between hard and unfair for some efs especially when it is
  influenced by being at a home ground and one of the top sides in english
  football.
