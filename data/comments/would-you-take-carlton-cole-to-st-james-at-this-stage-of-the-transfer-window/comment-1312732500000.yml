  the only resone that toon wont allow him in to our club is because he is just
  not good enough if we cant get another forward in we will just have to play ba
  up front on his tod as a holding role while support arrives from mid of the
  park gossling afra cabyane guitiarez but to name a few this is gonna be a new
  team with new direction lets give pardew our backing and we will have 3 points
  on the board come 13 aug the toon are the team to fear this season cant wait
