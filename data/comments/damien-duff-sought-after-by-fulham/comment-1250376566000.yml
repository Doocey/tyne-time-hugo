  I am a loyal irish american toon army soldier. I discovered football during my
  first tour in iraq 5 years ago. I fell in love with the toon because of there
  loyal fans and blue collar manner. I didnt go for man u, arsenal, liverpool,
  or chelsea like every other fairweather fan. Now with all the turmoil around
  the club it kills me. Ive read the history of the toon and its so rich in
  tradition and success and it feels i came to the toon during a disaterous
  time. As i type shola ameiobi has just put the toon up 2 on reading. We are
  still alive lads. Mike Ashley sale the club please and get out of the way. You
  have butchered the club enough. Give us al back and a real owner who wants to
  restore us back to our rightful spot as the fifth big club in england. Toon
  army for life!!!!!
