  He is more composed than either Williamson (who we know) and Coloccini - I
  think £3m is fair - but i suspect you will get him for £2m plus clauses
  because our commercial people are dumb! - we lost a £2m player in the summer
  because we thought we had another year at our option and we sold Danny Graham
  for half his value because we inserted a silly exit valuation
