  Offers nothing better than we have in Willo, and won't edge out a fit Saylor
  or Collo. Given the age and the price, NUFC would be better developing their
  youngsters than bringing in Mariappa. If Pard really feels the need to buy in,
  then it has to be someone who will add something we don't already have and be
  able to meet Ash's other recruitment criteria. Who is the best, under 21
  international, under utilised at his current club, French/Italian/Spanish(or
  possibly Dutch!!!) defender? Especially someone we once should considerable
  interest in.
