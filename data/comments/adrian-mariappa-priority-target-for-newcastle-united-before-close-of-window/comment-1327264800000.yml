message: "Interesting stuff.\nClearly NUFC see potential in him for one reason or another.Williamson a fine player on his day; had a shocker yesterday though!The only questionable thing about a possible move for Mariappa is his age, he's not getting any younger and with Colo 30, Taylor 25, Williamson 28 - there's years left in some of those players.Only time will tell what will happen I suppose. Been some servant for Watford \_so far though!\_"
