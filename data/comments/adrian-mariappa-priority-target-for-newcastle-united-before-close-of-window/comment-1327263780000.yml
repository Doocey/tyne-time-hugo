message: "watford fan here. id love the 3mil, but to be honest i think mapps is below the standard you have already. good player for us, and id like him to stay, but not as much as id love 3mil to invest in 2 or 3 championship players.\_\n\nhaving said that, im still amazed williamson has done so well for you, so what do i know? if he can do it at newcastle, mapps certainly can."
