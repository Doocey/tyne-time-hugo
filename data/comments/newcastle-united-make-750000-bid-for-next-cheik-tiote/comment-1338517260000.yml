  Would just like to commend Newcastle and Alan Pardew in particular for a
  fantastic effort last season. I always enjoy getting up to Newcastle when in
  the UK and think you have some of the most passionate fans in the country.
  Will be interesting to see if you can consolidate in the summer with more
  astute purchases.
