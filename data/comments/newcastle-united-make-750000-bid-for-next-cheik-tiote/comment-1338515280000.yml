o be expected of a
  player that young in a struggling team. 


  My estimation is that in three years he will start to hit his potential, what
  he needs now is match time at a senior level. He has also been quoted as
  saying god brought him to Cov to play football and has turned down moves to
  big clubs before saying it has ruined the career and attitudes of other
  players he knows. Not saying he would turn down Newcastle, just that he is not
  one of these chasing the money and the limelight of any big move.


  Certainly has the attributes to become a cult hero at any club with his
  praying on his knees, both arms in the air after victory! ( we didn't see that
  much last year though, lol )
