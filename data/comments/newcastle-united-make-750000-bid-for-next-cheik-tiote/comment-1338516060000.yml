message: "If he does reject a move, to\_continue\_playing at Coventry then I think it's fair to say almost all NUFC fans would respect that decision - it's not often that kind of thing happens.\n\nEither way, judging from Sky Blues fans on here (and thanks for taking the time to comment) - it seems like he has the makings of a very effective footballer.\nNeeds good coaching and playing time - NUFC could only provide one of those this season at least, whereas Coventry might be able to offer both.\nOnly time will tell!"
