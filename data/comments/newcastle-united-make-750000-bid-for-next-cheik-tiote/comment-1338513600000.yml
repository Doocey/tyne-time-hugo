  It's difficult to say how talented Gael is right now. Technically he should
  only have just graduated from the academy and was pressed into service early
  due to Coventry's financial problems.


  He's spent this season learning his trade and just doing the basics, laying
  the ball off to a teammate without having a major impact on games, so where
  the Essien comparisons are coming from I don't know. Perhaps as he gets more
  and more comfortable with first team football he'll come out of his shell a
  bit and have a bit more of an impact, possibly even becoming quite a decent
  playmaker but at the moment most of what he does is sideways. However he does
  look composed and wasn't fazed by the first team experience and seems very
  eager to learn and thankful for the chance he's got, possibly due to his early
  African upbringing.


  Physically he's quite small, both in terms of height and build, so I wouldn't
  say he's similar to Tiote either. He'll get stuck in but he's often
  out-muscled. Maybe as he gets older he'll bulk up a bit and that will change
  but I can't really see it.


  Just after Xmas he really started to look jaded too and desperately needed a
  rest.He's got potential but he's nowhere near ready for the top flight.
