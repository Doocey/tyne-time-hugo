message: "I'll be more than happy to be just playing back in the Premier League again next season.. before we ever got relegation it was easy to take for granted the size of our club that we will forever belong in the Premier League, so not only has the players learnt from the experience so has the fans possibly.. and for as far as I'm concerned I would love to be still playing Premier League football in 5 years to come.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know what to expect, and to be honest I feel we aint any better than any club in the Premier League, but our team spirit is for sure a lot better than I can remember it for some time now, and that can only help our progress."
