message: "Doocey, it’s nice to hear from an NUFC fan with both feet on the ground.  I was beginning to think I was the only one!  No doubt we’ll sign a few players in the summer, but I don’t think we’ll get anyone as high profile as Santa Cruz or Keane.  I really hope the reports about signing Harewood aren’t true!  \r\n\r\nI think we’ll probably have enough to stay up, but I think we’re looking at about 14th – 16th place.  I hear a lot of people saying stuff like “We’re better than Bolton / Stoke / Blackburn / Wolves / Wigan” etc., as if the bottom half of the PL is the same as the top half of the CCC.  Wishful thinking, in my opinion.  \r\n\r\nI also hear a lot of talk about how hard working we are and how great our team spirit is.  Is this really true?  It’s easy to assume when we have picked up points in all but 4 of our league games, but our good form has far more to do with playing against weak opposition than improvements we ourselves have made.  I don’t think these things are really tested until you’re under pressure.  It’s a shame we didn’t get to play a PL team this season in one of the cups, which might have given us an indication as to where we really are.  We’ve have had a good season in the CCC, but we shouldn’t under-estimate how difficult next season will be.  So let’s not get carried away."
