message: "Good job cutting the wage bills and keeping a good championship side. We all know Ashleys a numpty for all the crack that's went on but it would be in our best interest as well as his to keep ahold of the club til we go up, not that everyone would agree but iv been couldnt give a toss whether he stayed if he brought in good young signings worthy of the premier league, you know.. do something right for a change.\r\n...and as for Caroll its just daft, we've all done it but we're not on there wage! The amount of toon players you see on the drink is incredible... small sacrafice knocking blu bambu on the heed"
