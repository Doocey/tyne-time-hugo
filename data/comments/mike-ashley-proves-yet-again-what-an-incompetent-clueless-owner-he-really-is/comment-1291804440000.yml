  ...and according to reports he isn't exactly making the managerial vacancy
  sound like an attractive proposition either. If rumours are to be believed he
  is offering no signing on fee,  prescious little in the way of transfer funds,
  wants the club run " to Ashley rules, not football rules" and has left
  potential replacements in no doubt that he is calling the shots. He is also
  offering no compensation for failure and, lets be honest, for a guy who has
  ripped through 6 managers in 3 1/2 years you would really want a bit of a pay
  off, especially when no-one has any idea what the gimp classes as failure.
  Promotion, respectable position on a return to the top flight, a pittance on
  transfers, stability, loyalty. Are these failures? Don't get me wrong, i've
  never been a big Chris Hughton fan but there are ways of dealing with people
  and ways not too and you just can't treat people this way and find a top
  manager, as the club say they are looking for, willing to come in knowing that
  they can expect more of the same.


  If Ashley is as smart as he likes to think, he would brush over his complete
  lack of football knowlege by bringing in a quality manager on the managers
  terms and surround himself with people who have a clue about football rather
  than f***ng idiots and hangers-on and buddies from the casino. My God, as if
  being Great Britains biggest jackass wasn't enough reason for anyone with
  anykind of class to avoid the NUFC managerial hotseat like the plague! Like
  your head line says "Mike Ashley proves yet again what an incompetent,
  clueless owner he really is."
