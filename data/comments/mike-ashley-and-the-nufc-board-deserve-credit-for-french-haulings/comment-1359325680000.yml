  I still think we need a striker in this window, Wilfried Bony looks the part
  and so does Ricky Vanwinkleman. I would equally be happy to see Danny Graham
  step up to the plate a Geordie leading the attack bursting with personal pride
  of wearing that black and white shirt, get shot of Nile Ranger and Sammi
  Ameobi just drawing a wage and producing nothing.
