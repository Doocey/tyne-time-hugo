  You're free to criticise... that's your right. Nobody is disputing that the
  club should have bought players in the Summer, and Pardew has admitted that.


  I just hope all the gobsh*tes with their futile "sack Pardew" or "F*** off
  Ashley" nonsense will shut up for a bit and let us get back to supporting our
  football club. Football - remember that?
