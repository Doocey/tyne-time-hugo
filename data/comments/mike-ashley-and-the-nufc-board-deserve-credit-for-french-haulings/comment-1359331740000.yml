  We should have strengthened then I agree - there wasn't anything moving worth
  the money - Who could have envisaged the Injuries we have had, See it as a
  positive and that the club has been chasing down these signings that we have
  got in the January window.

  Not mismanaged if you look at the fact we are 20th richest club in the world
  football.

  The 3rd Biggest gate in the premiership and we now are the favourite English
  club in France! Got to be good days ahead!
