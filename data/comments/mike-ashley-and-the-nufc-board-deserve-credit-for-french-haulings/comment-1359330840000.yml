  I think that Ashley has a genuine passion for this club, financially he has
  steadied a sinking ship! Gone are the days where we can fork out 17m here and
  10 million there the players on offer are not good enough - lets face it
  English footballers are overpriced and overated.

  This club was injury stricken and the quality of the performance of the fringe
  players has been abysmal. 

  Going out and buying 5 top notch French international players (At all levels)
  who will cut it in the premiership, this has stimulated WORLD interest in this
  club.

  We will push on - we will get results - there will be flair - more importantly
  there will be enthusiasm and passion about this club.

  We wont win all 15 games - but I believe that they will take out 9 or 10 wins
  and finish top half!

  Next 5 years is where it will be with this team - realistically challenging
  the top 4 within 3 seasons!

  Money well invested and thank you Mike Ashley!
