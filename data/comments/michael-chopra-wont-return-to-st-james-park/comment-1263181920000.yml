  GeordieFootSoldier - I think it's widely regarded that Adam Matthews will end
  up at Arsenal for around Â£4mil, but not until August. Looks a good prospect, I
  think Aaron Ramsey will be the main reason, apparently the Ramsey and Matthews
  families are quite close, so it makes sense. Shame we cant tempt him up to the
  Toon, he does look a monster of a player. Cheers
