message: "Hi Doocey\r\n\r\nQuiet indeed today.\r\n\r\nI cannot see Chopra returning either.  \r\n\r\nAnyone else find it worrying that Lardarse and Lamebrain are heading to Las Vegas?  Hmmm  - no change there then!  So whether anyone will be coming in may depend on the spin of the wheel!!!!  So perhaps we should get our crystal ball out for Becks or Harewood.\r\n\r\nRe Toon Army comment about Cardiff's financial problems - if we are looking at any of the their players I would support Ledley also their young full back Adam Matthews."
