message: "I am proud of Andy Caroll. I was not easy to go in with just 15-20 mins remaining and giving your best to score a goal. As Stoke is toughest team in PL this season at HOME. By playing physical game, long throws, they make things difficult. I think today Shearer has understood better all players. I personally think, Ryan Taylor's throws today were good. We should be using more of these long throws by him with Andy in D of opposition. Who knows we might score 2 more goals from throws till  end of season. Even though Ryan didn't not played as everyone expects from him, but I still think he deserves a bit credit today for atleast throws. Also 1-2 free kicks were also good. Hopefully he will also get bit of confidence today and should deliver more for us. \r\n\r\nI am more worried about OBA's situation. GOD knows whats going on behind scenes. Just hope things are sorted by next game and he starts. We need him too.\r\n\r\n1 point is not great but it will be BIG point lads."
