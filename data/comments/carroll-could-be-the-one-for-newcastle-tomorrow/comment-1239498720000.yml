message: "Hi Doocey,\r\n\r\nYou might already be doing this, just in case you are not, please do following to move UP quickly into Google rankings:\r\n\r\n1. Do participate regularly in Social Bookmarking. I think best that you social bookmark every article of yours in atleast 2-3 most popular website such as DIGG , STUMBLEUPON, DELICIOUS, REDIT etc\r\n\r\n2. Have you set up PING for your blog ? This is a service which notifies all engines that you have published a content. This is automated process and you just need to configure it in you blog settings somewhere.\r\n\r\n3. If you have not already, use following links to get some valuable info about opimizing your blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.seobook.com/bloggers\r\nhttp://codex.wordpress.org/fr:Search_Engine_Optimization_for_Wordpress\r\n\r\n4. I think you should use static links instead of dynamic links. There is setting in Wordpress where you can say what kind of links you want to use for your article. This will make your blog more search engine friendly. This might also be mentioned in above links. I think this setting is under INTERFCAE-&gt;SETTINGS-&gt;PERMALINKS\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Please just ignore my advise if you don't like it or you already know this. I just thought to share as it might help you in case you don't know about this information. Just want to help you so that you get better search engine visibility."
