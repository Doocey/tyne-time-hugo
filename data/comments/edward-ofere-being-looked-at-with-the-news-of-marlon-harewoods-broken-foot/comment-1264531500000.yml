message: "Is it just me or does that you tube make vidoe make him look really average?  He looks like a youg Shola Ameobi! Why sign another lanky slow target man?? We need someone to get us 10-12 goals in the next half of the season.  Is this kid really better than what we have already??\r\nOn a lighter note, I hope James Tavernier plays on Wednesday, watched him for the reserves last season a lot at whitley park.  He looked to be the only defender good enough apart from perhaps Darren Lough"
