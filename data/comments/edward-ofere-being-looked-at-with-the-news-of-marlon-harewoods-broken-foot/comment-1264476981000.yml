  Thank God he's not like Martins, the most over rated striker we have ever had.
  I used to coach juniors and the most fundemental thing with kids is to keep
  their head up to see what's happening on the pitch, Martins could not do this
  he was garbage. One brilliant goal to five simple misses that sums Martins up.
