  Wel ne craic?

  From what he says here he seems interested in arsenal and can u really blame
  him?

  If we went down a lot of players would be keen to leave:-(:-(

  However,on that note i think the likes of
  bassong,nolan,jonas,guthrie,lovenkrands,the 2 taylors and barton(he owes us as
  he always says)could well stay:-):-)imagine that line-up in the championship!!

  But i think we will just steer clear of relegation!

  Wat does everyone think?
