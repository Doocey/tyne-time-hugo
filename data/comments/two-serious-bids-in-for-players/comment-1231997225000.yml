  This is great news for the club, and full credit must be given here to Mike
  Ashley. For all the turbulance he has had to deal with over the past few
  months, the fact he is still pouring money into the club, when he easily could
  of left the club considering the circumstances and leave us in a much worse
  position now, its clear to see that Newcastle fans should be thanking him
  insteadof vicitimising him over the past few months. Although I'm not saying
  his handlings into these sorry affairs have been fault free, he has not made
  too many errors, and I think the way the majority of the fans have treated him
  have been wrong.


  Anyway, in regards to the two £4 million bids, the fact one of them is a
  central midfielder is very good, considering the chance Geremi may leave the
  club. However, I do hold a slight anxiety about these players, as we bid £5.75
  million for Xisco in the summer and it seems to be an overpriced amount, from
  what I have seen of him over his few months stay.


  I really wish though we would make a bid for John Arne Riise. He is still a
  very good full back, one of the positions Newcastle need to fill, as well as
  posing a great attacking nature, and at around £3 million, he should be one of
  our main priorities. However, whether the rumours speculating around the
  newspapers as to Joe Kinnear's interest are anything more than rumours, we
  will have to see.
