message: "Hypothetical\_yes, but you know why I chose it as an example.\nYou must remember that we rejected the original bid of £30m for Carroll so we wanted to keep him, only for Liverpool's persistence/panicking/rashness to go an extra five.\_\nWe sold because you were willing to overpay, simple as.\n\nNow, when Carroll isn't required by Rodgers, we are offering you money that you probably won't get elsewhere and the chance to strike the Carroll conundrum off your balance sheets and move on. That is tempting Liverpool, don't be fooled.\n\nNUFC hold all the aces, because it's quite literally a win-win situation for us. We get him back for less and still make profit, or you keep and we still have £35m..\n\nAs for Carroll aerially, he was most definitely one of the best headerers of the ball (still is) in the UK. Check out his goals for NUFC before moving, some of them were simply sublime. His goal against Everton in the cup this year was well taken too, as was the one away at Blackburn. Even Didier Drogba claimed that he is indeed one of the best if not the best.I hope we come to a deal because I really don't think AC has a role in Rodgers' system, not an obvious one anyway.\n\nRegardless, the detailed comment responses are welcomed and encouraged on here. It proves one can have debate without foul or\_abusive\_language!\_Here's hoping we nab Andy :D"
