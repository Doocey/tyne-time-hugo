  Isn't that exactly what we did 18 months ago, or are you genuinely trying to
  say that you believe after last season, and so soon after being relegated and
  in the Championship, that Newcastles stock has risen so much, that a player,
  given the choice would now pick Newcastle over Liverpool....ahh, good for you
  Andy!

  Shame, I'm finding it harder to take you seriously with each post you
  submit.....!
