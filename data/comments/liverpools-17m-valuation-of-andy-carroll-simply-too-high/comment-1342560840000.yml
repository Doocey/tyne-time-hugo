  We're hardly gloating, we just think it's one of those moves where it worked
  out in our favour. Liverpool overpaid, and we ended having a better season
  than them, as well as Andy Carroll's replacements (Ba for free, Cissé for £9m)
  scoring bucket loads of goals, of the highest quality I might add.


  Quite ironic with every said.
