message: "Andy,\_\n\nI'm not labouring under any assumption, I made no inference in my post about what level your desire to sign Carroll was, 'desperate' or otherwise, \_you have made an offer you do want to buy him, and I believe your reasons are misguided (at least judging by the comments and the post of Newcastle fans), because as you rightly point you have two strikers who have one good premier league season under their belts they certainly wouldn't 'walk' into Liverpool sides but they have some promise, and your style of play has also improved.\n\nI am simply replying to a post (of which there are many) written by another Newcastle supporter who would (and I quote directly from the article) \"\nPersonally, I would love to see Andy back at St.James’ Park\"\_\_so your first point has no context.\n\nAlso no one said it was Newcastles fault that Liverpool bought AC so again not sure why you make this point. We didn't want to sell Torres either, but we also got silly money for him, I'd say both clubs overpaid by about 20 million, Liverpool probably even maybe a little more and Torres hardly set the world alight at Chelsea, but unlike Carroll at least he is a proven world class player, and I believe still is but that's water under the bridge, he left.\n\nFurthermore I think you have a poor grasp of the economics of Liverpool FC if you believe a player on the salary of Carroll will \"bleed the club dry\" of course it won't that's absurd. There is no need to cut any losses, we have wealthy owners and a debt free club with huge global support, we won't fold under his weekly wages, you make an erroneous point all decision re players Liverpool make are based first on football, then finances second.\n\nAlso once again, I did not say one thing about history or cups, so not sure why are bringing it up (chip on the shoulder perhaps). \_\n\nI know Liverpool's past, and Arsenals and Man Utds' and they aren't relevant. You did finish higher this year, I honestly can't remember how many times that has happened in the last 30+ years, but last season is also history is it not? and ironically the only person bringing that up is you, not me.\n\nJose and AC, these players are not ruined, they are being scrutinised under a higher expectation at Liverpool than before (undeniable fact I'm afraid), and Jose had a great 3/4 of the season till he tired towards the end because having reached two cup finals he played far more games than was previously required of him at Newcastle, as for Carroll, he showed his lack of versatility in a different formation to the old Newcastle style he broke through in, and under the weight of a ludicrous fee.\n\nFinally, realistically anyone can see it's not a a jibe to say there are bigger clubs than Newcastle in this league to argue there aren't is foolish. it's difficult to gauge size, so let just go on \_revenue \_for the sake of argument (we'll forget history and success shall we.) generated through a combination of success, and support.\n\nThis will do for starters(see below) - 6 teams (probably Villa as well) so about 1/3rd of the Premier league, as I said concentrate on the good players you did sign, that got you to that finish in the table because these 'bigger' clubs will come in for them at some point if they keep showing that form.\n\nI will also look forward to next season, Ladbrokes don;t often get it wrong do they?\nManchester City\t\_5/4,\_Manchester Utd\t9/4,\_Chelsea\_9/2,\_Arsenal\_12/1,\_Tottenham\_20/1,\_Liverpool\_25/1,\_Newcastle\_150/1\nGood luck...\n\n\n1.
