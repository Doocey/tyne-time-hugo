message: "\"What makes me laugh is Newcastle and their supporters (the writer of this article being a perfect example) smugly believe this is great for them, but they are courting a player who has been deemed a failure at one of the biggest clubs in the country?\"\n__\n\nLet's be honest here. If Liverpool went back in for Fernando Torres for say £20m, and he wanted a move back to Anfield (which he clearly doesn't) I think it's fair to say Anfield would be extremely excited about the possibility of his return for a cut-price. We didn't want to sell Andy but our hand was forced, and now after robbing our leading striker that year - we are offering you lot the opportunity to get over £12m back in cash and move on. No other clubs are offering a lump of money at the minute, and Andy doesn't want a move anywhere but St.James' - we're helping you out in one way.Carroll had 11 goals to his name by January in a newly promoted side, and was the most feared forward aerially, in the Premier League at that time.You made him the 'failure' he is at the minute - we'll get his form back with some proper service, a proper manager and some proper support.\n\nIt's best for all parties if he comes back to Tyneside and we both move on with our seasons. You'll have bagged millions and will make room for another forward of Rodgers choice. Straight forward. Either that, or you keep paying him £75,000 a week with little return, and all that time his potential transfer value reduces to single figures.\_\n\nYour call Liverpool."
