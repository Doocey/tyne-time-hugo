message: "Incorrect again.\n\nI said our 'hand was forced' - there's a\_differentiation.\nThe massive offer forced our hand, £30m didn't. £35m did.\n\nAs regards Ba - you're wrong again, his £7m release clause expires in just under a fortnight and I'm 99.9% sure he'll be at NUFC on August 1st. He certainly won't be at Anfield anyway. I doubt he'll be too fussed about the potential Carroll arrival either - Ba's almost a guaranteed starter in the team. We need depth for Europe, and since April, we've lost Lovenkrands, and Best - so we need to sign a striker. Will it be Andy? Who knows.\n\nWe have no aces? Take a look at our team after Andy left, we haven't even spent half of the AC fee. Cissé £9m, Cabaye £4m. The Santon fee came from the Jose Enrique money received. Plus, the Cissé deal was financed by Virgin Money's £10m per annum sponsorship deal that was signed in early 2012 - before Papiss arrived. We didn't go near the AC money for the forward what ever way you look at it.\nSo we haven't spent 'rather a lot' at all. Your assumptions are 'rather' off sir.\n\nRegards the deal in question, we won't lose sleep over not landing Carroll, whereas you lot are losing money with each passing day between wages, and in time - depreciation on Carroll's selling value.\n\nAs for the NUFC fans commenting - the majority are clean in their chat, but alongside many of your own LFC faithful; their comments can get heated, and their passion overflows a little bit hastily.\_\nAnd without sounding too harsh, Liverpool can't talk about having pleasant fans. The Patrice Evra scenario springs to mind. Don't stereotype, if you don't want to be stereotyped.\n\nEither way, only time will what will unfold in the Carroll scenario. If he returns to Tyneside it'll be a remarkable turn of events - if he doesn't - we'll just move on, none the worse off.Can you say the same?\n\nLook forward to next season folks!\n\n\n"
