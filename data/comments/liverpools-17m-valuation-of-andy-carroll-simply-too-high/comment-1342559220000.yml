  We certainly are not 'debt free'. A FSG-owned (UKSV I think its called)
  company lent the club money. There was also a bank loan issued 'at 31st July'
  last year, secured on the club's assets. We also have a 'facility' (like a
  loan that is available, which we have used some of it) with RBS, Bank of
  America and Barclays that is available to the club as well as another facility
  with Wachovia. To say we are 'debt free' is a load of rubbish. Ever heard of
  Google?
