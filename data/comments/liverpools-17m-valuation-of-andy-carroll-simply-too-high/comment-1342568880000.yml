  newcastle thought his valuation was 35 mill when we bought him and now
  newcastle still obviously think very high of him since they want him back.17
  mill is still less than half what we paid for him and your saying thats still
  too steep.i say look elsewhere then cause no way should we be letting him go
  for any less.are you saying that carrol is less than half the player he was
  then ? since 17 mill is too high.Geordie tossers trying to rip us off again
  .well hopefully rogers aint as nuts as dalglish was
