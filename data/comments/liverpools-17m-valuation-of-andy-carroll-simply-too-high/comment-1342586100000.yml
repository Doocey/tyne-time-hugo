message: "You said you were forced to sell, so at least you've downgraded that to you sold him \_because we were willing to overpay.\_\n\nAgain you reference we'll get money from you we won't get elsewhere ( a recurring theme), but so what, we aren't short of money.\nAlso I don't think you hold any aces in terms of a negotiation, we never said we wanted to sell him you made a bid and we refused we aren't playing a game, and as we can afford to keep him you have no aces. We just mentioned he might be available to loan,and you jumped all over it, and I still don't know why. Seriously how is Ba feeling when all your fan sites are awash with excitement and comments of how you would 'love' AC back, don't say he'll be happy.... You won't admit it, but for him it's a stepping stone, and 7million in January if you still have him, and he's still scoring goals is going to look quite attractive to someone......Also you say win win because if you don't buy him you still have Â£35million...er....no, you've spent rather a lot of that, I keep hearing how well you invested it so that doesn't wash either...I do agree AC doesn't look like he has a place in Rodgers system, but i for one was pleased when he said he wanted to fight for his place, and so he should, and we should give him a chance to, especially \_if the best price being offered is what you have on the table.Anyway unfortunately it seems most Newcastle fans visiting your site unable to manage without foul or abusive language - read through all their replies to various posts not a reflection to be proud of at all, they do your club no favour at all, but c'est la vie..."
