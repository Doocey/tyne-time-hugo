message: "I haven't been 'incorrect' in a single thing I have said Kevin, these are called opinions.\n\nAs I pointed out, you had a choice, the semantics of the specific words you choose to use are irrelevant, you did not need to sell him your owner made a 'decision' to sell a player who clearly didn't want to leave you were not forced, your hand was not forced, it was business.As for Ba once again this is just conjecture, so it isn;t 'wrong'. He will in my 'opinion' have seen Newcastle as a stepping stone and as I keep pointing out, I have no idea why you want to spend so much money on Carroll who you are now even appearing to say might well just be simply to add depth to your squad that feels like a change of direction to me (I'll come back to that).\_(FYI- I raised the point about Liverpool making an offer for Ba as a vehicle to point out anyone could come in and and take him, I certainly wouldn't actually want Liverpool to buy him I hope they don't, and don't believe they have any intention of doing so.)Furthermore you don't really think you manager will risk the league by taking Europe seriously do you, you are misguided(again this is an opinion Kevin so please don;t come back and tell me I am incorrect). It's fairly clear how lucky you were with injuries last year, and as you rightly point out, unlike numerous clubs at the top of the table you have far less strength in depth, you should spend you money more wisely than putting in offers for Carroll.One of the central themes of you article reflected a view that you felt it was 'perfect' ( or as close to perfect as you can get) which is ridiculous it bears no reflection on the market, what you really need, and most importantly whether you can afford the asking price (if indeed he is on sale), as you pointed out, you dictated the price of sale to Liverpool, yet now you perhaps it expect the other way around, because you seem to think we want to release him (it took one comment answering a question about a loan move from Rodgers to spark your bid to loan, now buy him back).Once again, no you don't have any aces, you are basing this on the idea we want to sell and your defence of the idea you hold 'aces' is that you probably don't really need him, or really want to buy him, could be someone else 'who knows'?\_Then don't write an article, that says you would love to have him back, and that it would be as close to 'perfect' as it could be be the two now don't tally up. Your subsequent replies to me appear to show you back tracking, either back up what you said, or accept it was misguided given what what you already have, and the position of your club currently.\n\nAS for the money, the point you raise is nonsense, it's like saying we didn't buy Carroll with the Torres money, it was with the money from Alonso and Mascherano, it's irrelevant where the clubs finances 'come' from for any specific transfer. So to say you have 'still' got 35million (which was what I made the point about) is nonsense. You HAVE spent rather a lot of money, the rest is back in his pocket for now. Remember how long you all complained he hadn't spent the Carroll the money for.....all forgotten now I assume. However you are also saying he still has all 35 million of it, it makes no sense I'm afraid it's one or the other, not both.\n\nAs for the people your site has attracted the 'majority' certainly do not I'm afraid it is more a minority, a disappointing visit. As I said just have a glance through you must be very proud of these people.\n\nAs for the debate, you've gone from saying \"Personally, I would love to see Andy back at St.Jamesâ€™ Park pulling on the Black and White stripes.\" &amp; \"Some things are just perfect. ....... is probably as close as perfect can get when it comes to football\"\_\n\nto\_\n\n\"Either way, only time will what will unfold in the Carroll scenario. If he returns to Tyneside it'll be a remarkable turn of events - if he doesn't - we'll just move on, none the worse off.\"\n\n\nQuite a different feel to the emotion and sentiment of these 'opinions' from start to finish.\n\nGood luck in Europe, good luck in the league, I hope you stay injury free, and I do hope you spend the 35million you still have (!?) improving your squad, whatever it is you'd love and is perfect for you I wish you all the best with it.\_\n\nRemember this, we'll only sell Carroll if we don't want him at the club it won't be because are 'hands are forced', the money doesn't matter to us, our objectives are all about getting our manager what he wants, an enviable position to be in wouldn't you say.....\n\nAll I know is realistically we can't do much worse next year ( we'll forgot the cups), and you can't do much better.....just my opinion.....I might pop back and see what you have to say about it all in a few weeks time once the reality kicks in"
