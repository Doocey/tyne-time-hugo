  If i were a newcastle supporter i would gloat as much as the article writer
  but i think you underestimate liverpools and carrolls role. I dont believe we
  are desperate to get rid and i'm not sure AC is that desperate to leave. He
  won't be able to dictate the terms so suspect nothing will happen unless you
  stump up a the right money which is more than Â£15m
