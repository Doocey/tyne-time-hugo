  JJ,


  First off, you seem to be labouring under the assumption that we desperately
  want Andy back, which isn't true at all. We've placed a speculative bid on him
  because your new manager has hinted that there's no place for Andy in his
  starting 11. We don't need Andy in our team, we already have two strikers who
  would walk into Liverpool's team.


  Secondly, it's not our fault that Liverpool wasted so much money on AC, you
  only have yourselves to blame. We didn't want to sell him at all until you
  offered silly money for him. If you want to sell him you're going to have to
  accept that you're not going to get anywhere near what you paid for him. He
  scored four league goals last season. £13.5 million is generous and if you
  don't like it then enjoy another another four years of Andy bleeding your club
  dry because we're not as keen to sign him as you are keen to cut your losses.
  We're going to dictate the terms of any sale.


  And as for the ambitious "big club" jibe, how far above you did we finish last
  season? How many world class players are lining up to play for Liverpool? You
  took two of our most promising players (Andy and José) and ruined them in one
  year. You can harp on about history and cups as much as you want, I'll enjoy
  comparing Cissé's goal stats to Carroll's this season.
