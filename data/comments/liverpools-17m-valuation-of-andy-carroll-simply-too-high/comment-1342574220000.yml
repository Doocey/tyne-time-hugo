  Sounds all familiar this, were you hyping up the arrival of KK in the same
  manner you are hyping up Rodgers? People making out Rodgers to be some
  messiah, hold your tongue and show some restraint, before coming out with some
  nauseating arrogant hype as we could easily be in the same position we were
  with KK in the league last season. We haven't won the league in two decades
  and were embarassing last season in the league, I would have thought at least
  some fans would be humble, but no. I thought Newcastle played a good mixture
  of football last season, the likes of Ben Arfa and Cabaye being instrumental
  in the good style of play.
