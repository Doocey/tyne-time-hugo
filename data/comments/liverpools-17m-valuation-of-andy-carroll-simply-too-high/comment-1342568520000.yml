message: "erm no, LFC are not debt-free. LFC owe FSG's UKSV company around £30m. Its an interest-free loan. The accounts for the year ending July 2011 makes that clear. You'll find articles by the likes of the Guardian that comment on it, published around in May (loads of articles were published around May on it as that is when the accounts became public, as that is when we fully knew how bloody expensive the homework on the potential stadium was, as it was given in the accounts). The same article by the Guardian, state the accounts also make clear there is a £120m borrowing facility with RBS, Bank of America and Barclays. Even the independent reputable finance football expert Swiss Ramble comments on this. These were stated on Liverpool's accounts, not FSG's or UKSV's, therefore Liverpool have a loan and Liverpool have a borrowing facility. If you understand the accounts, you will see that for yourself, the FACTS. If not, the several articles around at May make it clear for you anyway, the FACTS. The FACTS are that Liverpool owe UKSV money as well as setting up a facility. Read those articles at least, if you still can not accept we are not debt-free, than you are a lost cause who will continue to\_humiliate\_yourself when you shout we are debt-free...as we are not!\n\n\nWe are in a better position than we were under H&amp;G but puh-leez don't make we are debt-free when the OFFICIAL CLUB ACCOUNTS CLEARLY DISAGREE WITH YOU."
