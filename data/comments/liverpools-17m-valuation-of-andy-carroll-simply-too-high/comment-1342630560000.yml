message: "I think you're missing my point regards us being 'forced to sell' but I'll leave that one be.\n\nThe article in question harboured on the fact that in terms of a transfer deal, things couldn't have went much better than they did. We invested *some* of the AC cash wisely; we replaced him with a better striker in Papiss and even Demba; we had a memorable season, best in years; financially we're in a very good state and looking towards the future. Now, Carroll isn't wanted after his big money move, and personally wants a transfer back to NUFC - that's no secret. If that's not Newcastle United triumphing in the wake of losing their, then star man - then I don't know what is.\n\nAs for the Cissé money coming out of the AC fee, I firmly believe it didn't. It's a fair point referring to past transfers, but NUFC operate in a FIFO type method when it comes to the finances at St.James' Park.I don't think referencing transfers from 2008 at Liverpool really bear too much relevance here, especially as I'm talking about the same year\_signings\_were made.\n\nAlso, you say I'm wrong in claiming that your statement of Ba being able to leave for £7m *next January* was incorrect? Clearly, you got it wrong and as documented, his contract clause expires at the end of this month. As well as that, for the most - you're claiming my opinion is wrong, which is quite ironic of the highest order.\n\nYou mentioned that we were lucky with injuries? You make your own luck in this league, and frankly the investment in top tech equipment, proper training and rest periods, and first class medical care are to thank for our lack of injuries last season. We still had a number of absentees - Marveaux, Best, Coloccini, and Taylor. The last two, very important first teamers, and indeed captain.\n\nI've made it no secret that I would like Carroll back, and that it would be the cherry on the top, so to speak. The transfer scenario is perfect as is, whether he arrives or not. However, if we do get him back for somewhere in the region of £15m - it's been an\_absolute\_masterstroke by everyone at NUFC from the board to Pardew.Will we lose sleep over not getting him? Absolutely not.Will be delighted to get him for less than half what we received, just a year later? Of course, he's still a very talented CF. £17m is too high for my liking of course, but unfortunately if we are to lure him it won't be for £12m!\n\n\"All I know is realistically we can't do much worse next year ( we'll forgot the cups), and you can't do much better.....just my opinion.....I might pop back and see what you have to say about it all in a few weeks time once the reality kicks in\_\"\n\nThat's for sure, Rodgers will need time and patience for his plan to work.\_Hopefully\_he'll be given that time for LFC's sake.Thankfully, reality is always present on Tyneside because we know how quickly fortunes can change, especially with Mike in charge.\_\n\nI look forward to good season, and hopefully Papiss can repeat his feat at St.James' against you lot once more :D"
