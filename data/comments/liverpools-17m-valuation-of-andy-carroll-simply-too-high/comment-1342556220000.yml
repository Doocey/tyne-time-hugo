message: "Fine \_- keep him - newcastle are under no pressure to buy , we have enough strikers, he wont go to west ham or fulham so now what? - let him rot in liverpool reserves because he refuses to move anywhere else but newcastle? I have heard people saying newcastle might already of had a 25% sell on clause for andy on top of the 35 mill liverpool paid - so if you sell him back to us lol - take off 25% which would make the 20million some are quoting - 15 mill.\n\nNot fussed either way if he gets a move back tbh but pointless saying you dont want a player(rodgers) \_and then refusing to sell him for less than 20 million - the ball isnt in liverpools court any more and andy doesnt need to move - he could happily sit and take his wages for the next 4 years @ 75000 a week - good luck with that lol"
