message: "no one in their right mind would pay 35mil apart from the fenway group appeasing King Kenny and his\_worshipers (i thought us geordies with Keegan were deluded, L'pool r on anotha level)\_ So yeah, that was your valuation. now our valuation would be around 10mill - 12mill. at the time L'pool bought him we probably valued him around 15mill. I wouldnt buy him as I'd prefer cisse as the middle man"
