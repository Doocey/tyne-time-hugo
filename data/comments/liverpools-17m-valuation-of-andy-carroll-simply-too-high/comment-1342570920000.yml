  thats it this guy wants liverpool to do them a favour. liverpool already did
  newcastle a huge favour when they involved carroll in the torres deal. cant
  see him going to newcastle for less than 20mil. as for him only wanting to go
  to newcastle thats crap. he'd go to any club in europe with european football.
