message: "Newcastle already made a derisory bid for Andy Carroll before, and it was ignored. Liverpool will not sell him for less than they can afford to so whatever that price is, we will take the isolated financial loss, trade it against the inflated price we received for Torres and move on really no worse off, (other than having lost Torres).\n\nWhat makes me laugh is Newcastle and their supporters (the writer of this article being a perfect example) smugly believe this is great for them (like it's some great victory to buy him back for less that he was sold?) but they are courting a player who has been deemed a failure (so far) at one of the biggest clubs in the country? Good, perhaps he has not yet found his level and I don't think currently his quality matches Liverpools ambition yet regardless of value, so its interesting that you want him back at all, especially if you harbour great ambition (at least of competing at the top of the table).\n\nIf your club insist on making derisory offers for him Liverpool should keep Carroll (they don't need the money nor do they need to sell him), and\_simply offer Newcastle Â£7 millions for Ba, and trigger his release clause, because whilst you want Carroll back so much (probably for the wrong reasons), what you should really concentrate on is re-newing Ba's contract before you lose him to one of the many 'bigger' clubs in this league."
