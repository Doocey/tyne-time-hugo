message: "A totally hypothetical circumstance so a moot point I'm afraid wouldn't you say seeing as Torres doesn't want to come back.\_\n\nHowever even if we go along with this hypothetical point unlike Carroll it was his choice to leave for Chelsea, he wasn't sold against his will because his chairman wanted the cash (and of course you were right to sell him) so I disagree I don't think many people would be excited at all at that prospect, surely you understand the difference.\nAlso I can see how Liverpools hands were forced, Torres asked to leave, it's naive to think Newcastles hands were forced though you cannot (or at least should not) seek to keep a player who wants to leave you are 'forced' I think for the good of your club and the other players to let them go, but you should not be 'forced' by the prospect of profit, that's a choice you make, and you made the right one, but you were not forced.I really don't agree with him having been the 'most' feared forward aerially in the P eitherL, gross exaggeration, and it's not best for all parties that he go back to Newcastle for the price you want to pay for him.Until you meet the asking price (if indeed one has been set) then it's pointless making an offer, until then he remains an expensive plan B. I don't know why you want him back anyway, however, in the meantime imagine how it's making your other two strikers feel after the season they had....I expect rather like Liverpool buying Borini has made Andy Carroll feel, (and the apparent chasing of Dempsey) but he doesn't have a low release clause in his contract does he.....hmmm....Very unwise by Newscastle if you ask me, but as you say, it's your call....(I posted this later separately so missed you response, never scrolled down this far again!)"
