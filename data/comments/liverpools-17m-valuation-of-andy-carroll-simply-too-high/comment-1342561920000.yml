  Liverpool paid £35m for a player worth no more than £15m at the time and even
  that would be inflated for the fact he's English. We got a bargain when you
  look at the quality of the players brought in with that money. AC has had a
  pretty poor first season for a £35m striker so if we get him for £14m then add
  the price of the players we've bought with the £35m we'd still have £7m-ish
  left! That's why MA is a successful businessman.....
