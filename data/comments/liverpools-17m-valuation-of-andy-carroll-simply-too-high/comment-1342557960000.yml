  Newcastle can go whistle if they think Liverpool will sell for less than 20m.
  He's a big reason why we finished so low in the league. He missed plenty of
  chances and didn't have the speed of thought or the physical speed to get into
  positions when Suarez had turned defenders inside out. On his day, like the FA
  Cup final, he can be immense and that is the player worth 35m. But Liverpool
  won't be taken for mugs again and a deal will probably involve Ba if Newcastle
  don't offer up enough cash.
