message: "Andy,\nOnce again I don't think you read my post properly judging from your reply.\n\nI have not quoted any clubs values, any club budgets (they were revenue figures), or for that matter the expectations of any pundits, I'm not sure where you've got that from to be honest, perhaps you have misunderstood or read something else.\n\nAlso nor have I defended the transfer policy by saying we bought players with money from Torres (that said we also sold Alonso for £30 million, Mascherano for £18million to name just two, so don'r forget we generated plenty of cash through other player sales), so again all the points you raise are not relevant to a single thing I said?\n\nNot only that you also say \"contrary to what you claim, FSG have made it clear to BR that \_he won't be on the same money that Dalglish had.\"\_\_- (I'm assuming what you meant was given the same money for players)\_do please point out where this contrary statement is in my post. \_If it's contrary it would be something along the lines of saying anything what so ever about how much money the board are giving Rodgers, I said no such thing?\n\nOne thing I did say you have, it seems, partially misunderstood. Jose had to play more games due to our cup runs, he tired, he wasn't used to that at Newcastle very simple. Furthermore he'd be somewhat deluded to ever think he'd displace Jordi Alba in the Spain team whoever he played for and whatever his 'press statements' were, surely you aren't naive enough to believe them.\nHe left for the same reason most players leave a club whilst on the rise of their career path, more money, and the promise of something better (normally under the advice of an agent), he has one, and I expect in the long term he will eventually have both possibly sooner.\n\nAs for 150/1 it's merely an indication of what is expected of you next year as judged by bookmakers, which seems to be not much. You have certainly exceeded expectation for a promoted side, and its interesting you think winning a trophy of any kind should be derided (although it says more about your expectations of success in the eyes of a Liverpool fan than that of your own ambition). Last season it seems for the time being at least has allowed the majority in the Sports Direct Arena to now forget how they felt about Pardew when he arrived, and how they feel/felt for your owner (for the time being) it's really great, I am happy you've all found a better place, what a difference one season makes......\n\nUnfortunately it's difficult to take anything you have written that seriously though as you seemed to be replying to things I simply never said, still, at least you can spell....!\n\n"
