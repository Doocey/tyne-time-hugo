red. Liverpool will not sell him for less than they can afford to so whatever that price is, we will take the isolated financially loss, trade it against the inflated price we received for Torres and move on really no worse off, (other than having lost Torres).\n\nWhat makes me laugh is Newcastle and their supporters (the writer of this article being a perfect example) smugly believe this is great for them, but they are courting a player who has been deemed a failure at one of the biggest clubs in the country? Good, he has not yet found his level and I don't think his quality matches Liverpools ambition regardless of value so its interesting that you want him back at all if you harbour great ambition.\n\nIf your club insist on making derisory offers for him Liverpool should keep Carroll, and \_simply offer Newcastle Â£7 millions for Ba, and trigger his release clause, because whilst you want Carroll back,what you should really concentrate on re-newing Ba's contract before you lose home to one of the many 'bigger' clubs in this league."
