message: "The response was in reply to 'theonetheycalldave' who was indeed asking for 30m. I am aware of the figures being discussed in the article. Past trophies\_are not a measure of current performance, nor\_are they\_a measure of current transfer kitty. West ham do not have the current finances to pay more than 15m for a striker. That was the point I was making. The argument\_of who is the bigger club or who has historically had the most success is an irrelevance"
