  Yep you have won more than us however all your glory supporters will soon be
  supporting City or Chelsea. Toon supporters support their local team without
  the need of glory to keep them going as their love for their club is enough.
  Maybe you scousers are scared just how big a club NUFC would be if we had 20k
  plus glory supporters on top of our loyal fan base. Let's face it you were
  mugged with AC and you all know it that's why all you scousers are winging
  like mad. When we buy him back for 12m the whole of the football world will be
  pissing their pants at LFC. Times are indded changing losers!!!!!!!!!
