message: "I'm glad you're quoting club values, budgets and pundit expectations because it only shows how far Newcastle have come in the last two years, whereas Liverpool have at best stood still despite a substantial cash injection from FSG.\nI welcome massive teams coming in with huge offers for our star players because our scouting network has consistently unearthed undervalued gems. With the Carroll money we got Cabaye, Ba and Ciss√©. Liverpool on the other hands have wasted millions on overrated domestic talent and at the same time defended this transfer policy by saying \"it was bough with the Torres money so it doesn't count.\" Well I'm afraid it does, especially since like it or not, Liverpool like Newcastle have to make every penny count against the moneybags clubs. I'd rather have Newcastle's scouting network than Liverpool's finances any day. Especially since; contrary to what you claim, FSG have made it clear to BR that \_he won't be on the same money that Dalglish had.\n\nAs for the \"greater pressure\" not that hoary old chestnut! We were ahead of you in the league all of last season and you didn't have\_European\_football so that's a bit weak. If you look at Enrique's press statements he joined Liverpool to push for Champions league and to get a cap for his national team, he lost his form because none of this happened for him when he moved to Anfield and he was sick as a chip that it was Newcastle and not Liverpool who were pushing for CL until the very last day.\n\nSo what if we're 150/1 to win the PL? We have consistently exceeded expectations and we are moving forward. Liverpool have had a\_disappointing season on any conceivable scale. The Carling cup is just lipstick on the pig for Liverpool fans who'll rubbish Newcastle whilst laying claim to half of our\_squad\_in the same breath."
