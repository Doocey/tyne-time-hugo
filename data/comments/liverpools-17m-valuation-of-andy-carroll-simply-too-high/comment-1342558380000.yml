message: "It is great that Newcastle has enough strikers. Still, if they are not willing to pay the asking price, then leave him alone. The fans should stop dreaming about his return and the club should stop instigating their so-called \"legends\" to talk up Carroll and openly hope for their return. \nOn the other hand, I doubt Carroll will jump at the chance to move. Not when your beloved chairman Ashley pushed him out of the club and claimed he left for \"monetary reasons\" One thing\_Ashley got right was, it was for monetary reasons, his."
