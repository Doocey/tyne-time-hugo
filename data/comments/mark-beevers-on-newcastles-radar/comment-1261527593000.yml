message: "Has Beevers played for the U21`s ?\r\nWhere does he play CD or FB ?\r\nPlayer of the season at Wednesday, hmmm ! \r\nDont know aint seen him play, think Kilgallon may be a better prospect, depends on his price.\r\nIt has been said he was offered to Celtic for one mill.and they turned the deal down, so ? \r\nFrankly none of these guys appear to be great deals, perhaps we should be looking at a better quality than what`s available in this league.\r\nNo doubt Citeh`s new manager will be unloading a few decent players soon and restocking with his choices, perhaps we can pick up a bargain ?"
