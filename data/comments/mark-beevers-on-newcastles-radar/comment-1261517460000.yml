  I was suggesting him the other day to me mate, and the kid looks like a
  prospect...on football manager. Not sure what he's like in real life but if he
  got player of the season at 20 he's bound to be a good player in the future.
  We need a centre back and I personally don't mind who we get whether its sol
  campbell, killgallon or mark beevers as long as we get cover.
