  I hope it is sold as Ashley is a mug and has done nothing but sell our top
  players since he came to the club, when he took charge the club was generating
  a good income and was one of the top 15 clubs in Europe in regards to revenue.


  Because of reckless desssions and selling oour top tavel he has reduced the
  clubs revenues by a third.  Again this summer seems to be more of the same
  with Enrquie on his way to line his pockets.


  I would not mind an Indian owner providing he stops the root and starts to
  improve our current condition, Ashleyitist.
