  Well, as the article says, he's already spent Â£250million on the club. I'm not
  sure, but I imagine that's probably 10% of his money. The reality of the
  situation is he's already put in a lot of money and he's not going to put in
  much more. And also let's face it, we're a top class striker away from being a
  top 8 side. Anything else would be a bonus.
