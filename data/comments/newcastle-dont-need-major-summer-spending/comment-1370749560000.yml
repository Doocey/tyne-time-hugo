  Newcastle donâ€™t need major summer spending? Off course not if we dont have any
  other ambitions than to avoid relegation. Whats the point of owning a football
  club if you care more about profit than trophies? Mike Ashely should follow
  other owners and invest in the side to make us a CL contender or he should
  sell the club to someone who will.
