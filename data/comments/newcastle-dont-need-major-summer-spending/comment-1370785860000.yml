  What a load of shite.


  We NEED more then 2! Harper has gone and needs replaced. Simpson has gone and
  needs replaced. We could do with another central midfield player as Perch
  covering isn't the long term solution. We need some width because Jonas no
  longer even cross's the ball never mind getting an assist or two (Ince or
  Sinclair are obvious) 


  Importantly, we NEED 2 forwards. We currently have Cisse and Shola. You could
  say Cambell too but he needs to go out on loan and get experience. the fact is
  was unable to get a place in the England under 20's squad (not u 21's) should
  highlight hes not ready for 1st team football. Over the past 18/24 months we
  have sold Carroll, Ba, Best, lovenkrands and Ranger and replaced them all with
  Cisse. 


  Standing still in the premier league results in relegation and that what you
  are proposing
