  Well that's what happens when you sign 3 foreign defenders in January and just
  throw them into the mixer. Debuchy and Map are quality defenders who didn't
  suddenly become awful overnight, they'll only improve with pre-season under
  the belts. The defense we had at the start wasn't good enough and injuries
  exposed that there was nothing beneath Colo and Taylor. The quick fix in
  January didn't work. And as for the bit about not creating chances, that's
  actually a very common misconception. We actually created more chance this
  year than last, the only difference being Ciss√© scored less than 1/10 chances
  as opposed to 2/3 the year before. So, besides maybe cover for Cabaye and
  Pearce from Reading for depth, yes I do think a striker who can finish chances
  would be enough.
