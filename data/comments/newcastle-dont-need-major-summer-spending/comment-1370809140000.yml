  Did Ba really create that much? Don't seem to remember him getting many
  assists. On top of that it seemed like he'd shoot from any range rather than
  pass to Ciss√©. But I see your point that we need chances created from more
  places than Cabaye and Ben Arfa. But considering that we can't score, I think
  a real poacher should be a priority before that. As for the M'biwa bit,
  totally agree. But I fear Pardew might want to keep Taylor because he's the
  last Englishman in real contention for a starting berth.
