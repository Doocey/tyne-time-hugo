  Haven't really seen him play but heard some good things about him.

  If we were to get 2 out of:

  Him

  Raul Mereiles

  Elano

  Johnson

  I feel that our midfielder will be strong enough to put up a challenge against
  any team in the league.

  First team:
   Gutierrez --- Mereiles----Barton---De Mul / N'zogbia
  With as back up:
   Lua-Lua -----Guthrie ---- Butt------Duff
