message: "I for one am glad that Ashley has spoken out at last.\r\nI think he is right about Moat, if you cant afford it dont buy it.\r\nNewcastle dont need a man who is scraping together money from god knows who to buy the club. Before you know it we would be back up for sale again and then what!!!\r\nMistakes have been made that is for sure and the biggest loser in all of this is Ashley himself. \r\nI have been going to the games for years now and it never surprises me the stupidity of the average fan.  Most EX season ticket holders didnt renew out of Principal for the season saying \"he aint getting my money\" but week in week out you see them firstly standing at the box office and secondly wandering around looking for thier seats half hour into the game.\r\nTo summarise i want ashley out but i dont want Moat as he simply cant afford it.\r\nEx season ticket holders you should just go out and renew and stop whinging all the time because no matter what Chris and the players say they ARE distracted by comments and the goings on OFF the pitch."
