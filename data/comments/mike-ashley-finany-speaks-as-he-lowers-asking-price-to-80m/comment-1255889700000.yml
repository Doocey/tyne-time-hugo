  How I detest that man.  Who forced him to purchase the club in the first place
  - not the average fan?  Also let me tell Mr. Ashley that the 'average fan' as
  he calls us, does not buy season tickets etc., for profit but to see his/her
  beloved team.  Our reasons are totally the oppostite to him.  He bought into
  us to make money, as an investment if you like and also to pander to his
  self-indulgence.  On the other hand, we never, ever hope to make money out of
  the club; our only profit would be in seeing us win something, God forbid.
