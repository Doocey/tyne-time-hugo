message: "I hope so Killy Mag, then again there's a few more that need rid as well.\r\n\r\nO'Hara is a tidy player, though Droopy draws would be mad to get rid of him permanently, especially since he holds a home grown spot for the Spuds.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer an out an out attacking central midfielder along with a man-mountain style hard tackler in the middle; but the craze is all rounders who generally excel at nothing in particular apart from passing, vital i know, just limited impact in the middle unless they are Scholes."
