  Im just wondering any any fans think smith is capable of doing the holding
  midfield job he is doing now in the premiership next year he doesnt seem to be
  as mobile as he once was a bit like butt. Maybe its time to cash in save some
  money and give guthrie a try or get someone else in mind you if alladyce was
  even thinking of a swap/px deal andrews no thanx, but morten gamst petersen
  and about 4m would do nicely. we seem very light weight on the right and we
  are starting to become predictable hence the poor results of late stop enrique
  and gutierezz playing and we are in trouble nothing else happening.
