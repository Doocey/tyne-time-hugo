message: "Would anyone play colo in midfield instead of smith and butt? Seen him play there for us last season against man city, prob his best game, apart from the opener against man u. He's more mobile than both, can tackle better, maybe pass better? \r\nHe can't play centre half in the premiership that's for sure."
