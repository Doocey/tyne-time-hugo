  Martins could run fast and that's it. He has no guile, no vision, no
  footballing brain, he couldn't pass to another team mate or make space for
  other players to save his life. He's a scorer of great goals not a great goal
  scorer, ie he'd score 5 or 6 screamers a season but miss 10 times as many
  easier chances.
