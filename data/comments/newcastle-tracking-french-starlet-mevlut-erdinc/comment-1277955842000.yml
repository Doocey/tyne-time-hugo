  I&#39;m a PSG fan, and i do not think there is any chance that Paris allow
  Erding to leave this summer (especially not for less than what we spent to get
  him). In a  very dark season, he has been one the rare satisfactions. <br>I
  wouldnt say that he is that good in the air (surely not as good as Shearer)
  but yes, he is very physically capable , a little bull, and also very fast, a
  pain in the ass for defense, and very fast and technically capable too. Never
  complaining, and only 23. <br>I sure love the magpies, but there is definitly
  no way Erding leaves us :p
