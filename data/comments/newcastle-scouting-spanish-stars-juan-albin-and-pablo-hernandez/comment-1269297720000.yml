  There is no way Pablo Hernandez would join newcastle!He is one of the most
  promising spanish players around,and I indeed expect him to be in Spains plans
  for this years world cup!He would be an unbelievable signing for us,but there
  is no chance tbh,he unlikely to leave with Silva, Villa, or Mata most likely
  leaving Valencia in the Summer, and if he did it would mostly likely to be to
  a team like Man utd or Liverpool(hes previously been linked with both!).As for
  Albin he is a very talented little player who I would to join us,but I can't
  see it happening either!
