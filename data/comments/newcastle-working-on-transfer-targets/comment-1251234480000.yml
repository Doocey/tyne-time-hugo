  13 weeks of absolute rubbish all this has done is totally disrespect the
  players the club the fans and the city of Newcastle how long will this be
  allowed to go on i expect there to be a massive backlash when this winning
  streak does end i think a lot of people are taking their eye of the ball (no
  pun intended) because the team are doing so well at the moment
