  Thanks Chaucers Left Testicle I think most Toon fans have a good relationship
  with Liverpool fans so if we had a choice of Carroll going to Liverpool or
  Tottenham I know who I would prefer he be sold to. I feel totally gutted about
  this situation and do not think that this is good business on Newcastles part
  reason being who at Carroll's age can we get in that is as good or better than
  he is for £35m or less? We havn't got a replacement and have also let another
  two go in Routledge and Xisco (not a big fan of the latter). There will not be
  £35 million spent on a transfer fee in the summer either because Pardew has
  already stated that the £35 million will be to cover wages as well as a
  transfer fee. I think in this situation both the club and Carroll are lying
  because at the end of the day both could have refused the deal as Carroll had
  a 5 year contract at the club.
