  To write the acquistion off as simply a 'panic buy' is missing the point
  somewhat.


  Liverpool had been monitoring Carroll for a few months and from what I've read
  they were planning on moving for the player in the summer, but the late hour
  at which Torres handed in his transfer request forced them to move their
  timetable forward and pay over the odds.


  So while there was definitely an unsettled element to the purchase, it
  certainly wasn't flat panic.


  I, and most other reds I've spoken to, feel for the toon fans though. The
  circumstances weren't great and it's a shame you've lost your top homegrown
  lad.


  Still, he's a good player and I think he'll do well at Liverpool and I'm glad
  he's here. I do fear for the money though, Ashley hasn't got a good track
  record, has he?
