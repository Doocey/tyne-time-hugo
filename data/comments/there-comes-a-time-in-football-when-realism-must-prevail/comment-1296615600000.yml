  Yes I agree with you,it's time that we try to look in a positive way on this
  deal.It's alot of money for an injured player and hopefully our managment will
  spend those money wisely.I think he moved cause of a greedy mind and who with
  his mind function would say no to Â£.80000 a week?Nobody i know would for sure
  and why should A.C be any different.we have won some matches and some draws
  without Andy in the last month and we will for certain win some more
  too..Howay the lads,bring them on
