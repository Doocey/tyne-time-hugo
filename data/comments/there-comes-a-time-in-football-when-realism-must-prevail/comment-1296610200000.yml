  Super article, makes you look at it in a different light, what club can boost
  they sold a 22-year old not fully proven for 35 mil. Fat mike will probably
  reinvest about 10 million if even just the usual from the fat controller. Also
  starting to think the craps coming from carrolls mouth but you never no with
  nufc ... HOWAY THe LADS FOREVER
