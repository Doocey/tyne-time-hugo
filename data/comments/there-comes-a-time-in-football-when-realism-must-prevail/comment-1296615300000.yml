  In the greater light of reason, who the F##K cares. The sport, like all sport
  utterly polluted by $$$, needs to crash and burn. It was a far better game,
  and much less soul-destroying, when it was played by amateurs and when every
  player in the team was local. Meanwhile, the greater things in life, such as
  Life itself, pass us by unnoticed until it's all too late.
