  If we wanted to keep Andy we could have. Blackpool had no problems saying no
  to Charlie Adam's transfer request until the right bid came in. Why couldn't
  we do the same? The smart answer would have been to say 'we'll wait until
  summer when we know we're safe from relegation', instead of making Liverpool
  pay through the nose but not having a contingency plan regarding our striking
  line-up, which frankly is well sub-par.
