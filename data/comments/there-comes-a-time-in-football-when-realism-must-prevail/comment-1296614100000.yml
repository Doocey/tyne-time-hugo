  This is exactly what I've been trying to tell my mates. The fact is, if Andy
  really wanted to stay he could have. It is very disappointing that Andy made
  this choice, I truly believed he would be an exception to the 'no loyalty left
  in football' rule. The problem we have with football now in England is no
  longer just a football problem, it is a damning reflection of our society as a
  whole. What happened to the collective. Greed, selfishness, and the
  empowerment of the 'individual'. What an absolute disaster.
