  It is a shame we've lost a local lad, with extreme talent - and it's
  disappointing that he won't play out his finest years in a Toon shirt.

  However, with that said ; I do really think this was as close to a panic buy
  as you can get.

  £35m is over the top, and even though he may justify this price-tag in time,
  it's a massive risk.

  I think the fact Torres was all set to go, the board, and Kenny realised they
  needed a new forward, and very quickly.

  You may be correct however though, that they were monitoring him for quite a
  while but what I'm saying is: Would you pay the guts of £40m for a player with
  6 months Premier League experience? I don't think many clubs would.


  However, as some of the readers have said; Liverpool is a good club for him to
  develop at, and he'll relish having the #9 shirt.

  Onwards and upwards for both of us!
