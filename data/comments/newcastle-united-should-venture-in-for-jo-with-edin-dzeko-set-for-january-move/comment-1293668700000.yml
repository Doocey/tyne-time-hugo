  Utter tripe

  Caiceido and Jo would not walk into other premiership teams

  Santa Cruz cannot even walk

  If you cannot afford players don't expect handouts, leave the premiership to
  Sunderland 

  Why are City stupid enough to loan you a player, if he is crap you send him
  back, if he is good you get a bargain?  Get real!

  The reason City spend so much is because clubs ask unrealistic prices so that
  is the reason, greedy clubs like Newcastle trying to cash in because of City's
  money

  Losing millions on players is no big deal, it is small change to Sheikh
  Mansour

  However, we won't waste it on the likes of potential such as Andy Carroll who
  is not even an England regular

  You are what City used to be, a laughing stock with fans like you who know
  nothing about football or have a clue what is going on at Eastlands
