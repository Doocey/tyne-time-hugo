  This is tripe. Man City wouldn't let him go for that and he'd want wages we
  wouldn't pay. I used to admire Man City and always thought of them as a
  similar club to NUFC (badly run, sleeping giant with a working class fan
  base), but they have turned into another club that everyone despises because
  of the money the new owners have thrown at it. NUFC has it's problems, but I
  hope we never get a super rich owner where money is no object as it just sucks
  the heart and soul out of the club and doesn't always produce results as was
  proven with Michael Owen and the numerous other duds that were bought by our
  last bank-loan happy director. While I'm here, if you divide England in South,
  Middle and North, Manchester in in the Middle, not the North!
