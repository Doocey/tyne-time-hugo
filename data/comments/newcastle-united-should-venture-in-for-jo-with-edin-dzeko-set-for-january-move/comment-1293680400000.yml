  you wish you had our money  you jealous dog, remember we have lived under a
  red shadow for years and now we are emerging from that,sorry to say but you
  have never been in the shadow of sunderland,the way people talk about the
  money city have spent you wouldnt think anyone had done is before,chelsea ,the
  scum,leeds they have all done it,sir arsehole has wasted millions at old
  crappord,think of veron, forlan and anderton,also ferdinand who at Â£31 millon
  was a joke.

  so before you start calling my club ,think,i would rather have our boy and all
  his riches than that idiot you have got,jesus  chris hughton did not deserve
  him,and as for sucking the heart and soul out of our club, as a season ticket
  holder for many years,i can tell you the feeling and atmosphere at the ground
  has never been as good.

  i have always had a soft spot for nufc but idiotic comments spoil that
