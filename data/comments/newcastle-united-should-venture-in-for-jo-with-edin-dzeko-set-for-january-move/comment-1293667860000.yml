  Why the pointless digs at us? Why so bitter? If, as it was rumoured, ADUG were
  looking at NUFC as well as City would you be so critical had they chosen the
  Toon? As for spending millions on overpriced players, Jean-Alain Boumsong
  anyone? Albert Luque? Don't be such a fucking hypocrite in future please mate,
  and leve the bitterness to the rags.
