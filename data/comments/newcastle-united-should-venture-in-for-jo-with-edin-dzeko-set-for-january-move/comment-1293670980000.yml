  No mate, it's not fact. Stating we have "shamed" the world of football is an
  opinion. Look at it like this. Did you lot flinch from spending big on players
  and wages (relative to the time) when you were regularly up at the top of the
  table. A time, incidentally, when we were plowing the furrow of lower league
  football. No-one cared about leading prem clubs paying big money then. What is
  happening at City is the culmination of the commercialisation of the Premier
  League, of which NUFC has been an integral part from day one.


  Jo not had a chance? Do you bother to do any research at all? He's been in and
  around the squad all season. Hughes fucked him off to scouse2 and Galatasaray
  because he was a complete waster when he first arrived - examples include
  going out on the piss when he had missed training due to a "sore throat".


  As for wasting money - we are level on points with the league leaders. Some
  waste that is.
