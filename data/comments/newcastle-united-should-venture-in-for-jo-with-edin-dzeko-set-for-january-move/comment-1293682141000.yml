  Digging? Is that what you call my observations on the goings on at Manchester
  City?

  I'm not the only one of this opinion, and there's a reason for it.

  All of you City fans are willing to defend the outrageous spending? £290,000 a
  week on Yaya Torres, £286,000 on Tevez, millions <strong>wasted</strong>, and
  there's no debating that.


  Spending millions will only bring you so far, you need a team spirit to
  achieve trophies, and I'm not talking about Newcastle United, but the likes of
  Manchester United's, Tottenham's etc.


  Throwing millions at players won't win you the league either, and as 'on top
  of the table' we'll see what the scenario is come the end of the season shall
  we?

  As for Keegan, sure he did, but did he use most of the players he brought in?
  I think so. 

  Did we nearly win the league two years in a row? Looks like we did.

  We didn't splash anywhere in the region of Manchester City though, and as for
  the poster about Alan Shearer and £17m and all that, Shearer was a legend, one
  of England's greatest ever strikers - and certainly justified his £17m price
  tag.

  We didn't win the league no, as you know, The Red Side Of Manchester snatched
  it.


  <strong>Antoniosmithio</strong> sums it up perfectly. I'd much rather to avoid
  rich owners, even though I know many Toon fans would love huge investment in
  foreign talents.

  Do we really want a club with a bunch of players solely there for the money?


  Anyway, agree to disagree then.

  Good luck to both of us for the remainder of the season.
