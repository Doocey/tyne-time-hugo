  To all you Citeah boys here I'm going to tell from the heart of a true
  football fan that your club is indeed a black spot on the once great spectacle
  that was the EPL.Your lavish spending has both annoyed me and made me
  chuckle.The money your arab goons have been splashing about is outrageous,but
  I also saw the funny side of this when we battered you off the pitch the other
  evening,even though your transfer budget dwarfs ours!.YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO
  ENGLISH FOOTBALL!Don't believe me?just check out how your neighbors up the
  road run their club,because no matter who comes in January you will still be
  behind them come the end of May.Newcastle til I die!
