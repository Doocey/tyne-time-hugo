  Stop digging. You are talking total rubbish, you're embarrassing yourself.
  Stop it!!! Don't really want to dignify your diatribe with a debate but you're
  forgetting one thing....all the surplus players you've mentioned were not
  signed by Mancini. How many managers have wanted to sign their own players and
  build their own team? I don't think i need to remind you what Kevin "the
  Messiah" Keegan did at your club not that long ago do i? Jog your memory!?
  er... bought a lot of his own players at great expense to try to bring success
  to NUFC. Pot &amp; Kettle again perhaps? Mmmmm, now will you shut up? CTID!!!!
