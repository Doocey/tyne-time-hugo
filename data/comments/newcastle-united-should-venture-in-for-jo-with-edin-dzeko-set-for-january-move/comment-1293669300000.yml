  You insult our club then want a handout ? I thought your much loved owner
  wasn`t a skint member and could actually afford to buy players,not like our
  Salford neighbours who could only loan Tevez.

  How do you value a player then? 


  Ronaldo £80m,Kaka £60m,Ibramovich £40m +Eto`o=£70m you broke the world record
  for Shearer and he is a legend up your way
