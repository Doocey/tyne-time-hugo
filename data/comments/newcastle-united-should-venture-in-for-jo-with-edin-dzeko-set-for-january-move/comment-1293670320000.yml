  To be fair, I'm not bitter towards Manchester City at all, just pointing out
  their extravagant spending, which has been needless, wasteful and outright
  disgraceful.


  We have wasted money in our years yes, but those days are gone, and it was
  nothing to the extent of the current City setup. Why buy a player for £18m and
  don't give the lad a chance? Or Adebayor for £25m and he isn't given a kick.


  There's no defending the ruthless and pointless spending of Manchester City,
  simple as.

  However, if you had read the article, which I hope you had, you would see that
  I'm talking about Jo coming to Newcastle United, not dedicating the whole
  article to City's financial expenditure.


  One final thing, anything I have happened to mention about City, pretty much
  all fact eh?
