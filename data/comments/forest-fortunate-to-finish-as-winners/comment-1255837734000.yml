  I disagree with all of you say, first half Forest were the bottom team,
  playing the better football and hounding down your players leaving them no
  time on the ball. 


  We could have easily have been 3 nil up if it wasnt for your keeper. 


  Second half was a different story and United threw everything forward but just
  could not get the goal they needed. 


  Well Done Forest, You Reds!!!
