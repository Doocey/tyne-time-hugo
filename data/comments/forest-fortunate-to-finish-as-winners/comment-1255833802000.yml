message: "You might well be right, if a little ungracious especailly to a team all be it a little off the pace in recent years, but one that has won more significantly more than you in the last 30 years, it takes more than a fantastic and large support to make a big team!\r\nIt really was a game off two halves and I for one thought your goal was legit until viewing the replays, where it was clearly marginally offside. \r\n\r\nI really do I hope you go back up at the 1st time off asking, you deserve to be in the permier league, but if you insist on being so condesending about more succesful teams than yours you deserve the same treatment that leeds are now getting."
