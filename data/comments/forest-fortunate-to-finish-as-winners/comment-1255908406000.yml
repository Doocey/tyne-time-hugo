  The only people that think that your "the biggest club in the league" are
  those that support n.u.f.c. I like newcastle, its club and supporters! I am
  sure this sort of "we were robbed, we should be playing champions league
  football, were bigger than man.u." attitude that is printed in the north east
  media is completely counter productive to the success of the club. You were
  beaten buy the better team on the day and this report has only fuelled the
  belief of the average media brain-washed jordy fan! I hope that newcastle
  return to the premiership asap. But please don`t flatter yourselves that your
  a "big club" because you happen to have a big ground!
