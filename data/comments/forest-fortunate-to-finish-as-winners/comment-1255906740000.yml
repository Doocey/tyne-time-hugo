message: "Lots of rubbish being spouted out by both sets of fans on here. I looked at this article as I was interested in seeing the opposing fan's point of view. But the article is sadly lacking in perspective, and the comments are a damn sight worse.\r\n\r\nI'd like to say that newcastle are a big club which means that they have spending power and a fan base that any big club needs. If Forest's fans view that a big club only includes a team that has won trophies in the past, then I disagree. Forest have a special history, more special than most even in the Premier League but that doesn't mean they are a big club either. Football is all about the future and what a team hopes to achieve in the near future. Big clubs are the select few who have a chance to win anything in that near future, which rules out both Forest and Newcastle. Both teams belong in the Championship, nobody can deny.\r\n\r\nAs for the game, the best I've seen on TV for ages. For me it says alot about how good the Championship is, not about how bad both teams are. Forest took the fight to Newcastle in the first half and deserved their lead. It could have been more but finishing chances hasn't been Forest's speciality this season, for example, Blackpool, Blackburn, Wednesday and West Brom just to name a few teams we should have beaten but didn't because we didn't take our chances. Newcastle could have brought it level on a few occasions throughout the game but didn't which for me just added to the excitement and tension as all Forest fans must have been feeling in the second half. But Forest hung on for the win. It means nothing more than 3 points though and we have every chance to lose to Barnsley on Tuesday as this really is a league where anyone can beat anyone else.\r\n\r\nAs for the article, keep it more factual and use less expressive language that leads to bias next time so as not to receive tirades like you received in this one. It wasn't a blatantly legit goal, it was offside. Our goal wasn't dubious unless you meant that Blackstock didn't actually mean to hit the target, which I'm pretty sure he did. You didn't have any decisions go against you, actually one of the best refereeing displays I've seen all season and Forest weren't fortunate to win this game, they won it fair and square, that's that. Contrary to popular belief, there's no luck in football. There's just human ability vs human error (including the ref) that decides the result. And Forest's ability was more than Newcastle's and the ref played no part in the result on this occasion. I just thought it was a great game and being a Forest Fan, I loved the result. Newcastle can still go up though they need strikers and a resolution to their off the field situation. But then I don't care about the Toon, sorry. It was another good result for the reds, another 3 points and a new dose of confidence to help us keeping playing well."
