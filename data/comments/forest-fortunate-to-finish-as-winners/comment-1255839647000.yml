message: "I appreciate your comments but I don't think it was that biased of a report.\r\nIf you read the article, which I suspect you did, then you'd probably see that I said Forest inevitably deserved the game.\r\nHowever, if Nolan's goal has been allowed which on a another day it would, and Ryan Taylor's free hasn't hit the wood work, and indeed had Nile Ranger's glorious chance from the corner hit the net, then it could've been very different.\r\nI think Forest are a good side and you'll see that in my previous articles. First half they were good, 2nd half not so much. Can't argue that they were quiet impressive though."
