  I really don't understand the thinking of Newcastle fans, before this game,
  all the way through the international break, the toon message boards were full
  of people suggesting you would walk all over Forest, and thrash a team who are
  on one of the best forms in the league. Its your lack of respect for other
  teams in the championship that is annoying, as if you have some divine right
  to beat 90% of the teams in the championship. Forest dominated the first half,
  and really in the second half, it was only from set pieces that you looked
  like you might score, beyond that Forest kept you out all night, very few
  chances.
