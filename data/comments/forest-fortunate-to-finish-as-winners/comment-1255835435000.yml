  Your comments on the game show everying that is wrong with Newcastle United.
  In terms of support you are up there with the best. In terms of sucess you are
  nothing like a 'big' club. You are in the championship for the same reason as
  we are. Both you and Forest are not in the premiership because we are not good
  enough. That means there are at least 21 clubs better than you or us. At least
  we realise that. You continue under the delusion that somehow you area big
  club in the wrong division. You are a well supported club in the correct
  division.Your report on todays match does not indicate that you were outplayed
  in the first half and could have been 3-1 down by halftime. The second half
  goal was correctly called offside so where are your complaints? Judge it as it
  is not as you wish it to be.
