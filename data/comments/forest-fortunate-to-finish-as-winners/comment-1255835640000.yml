  what a totally biased report that is.Did you see the same game as the rest of
  us?you could and should have gone in at half time at least 3 goals down.Study
  our goal carefully,you,ll struggle to find a better move with a finished goal
  all season in the Premiership.let alone CC....I thought your goal weas
  good,until i saw the replay and even YOU have to admit he was offside.if
  you,re gonna report,try not to be so biased ,it takes two to tango....and
  thankyou to all your fans who were expecting a 5 nil thrashing(our players got
  wind of those comments)....FOREST ARE BACK....
