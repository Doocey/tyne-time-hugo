  who did we play off the park yesterday LEEDS UTD OR NEWCASTLE UTD?this person
  who wrote this article was either on happy sauce or smokin wacky baccy,you are
  gettin more like dirty leeds everyday thinking you have a right to be big just
  because you have a few fans forest battered you first half and then like we
  always do when winning under billy(is a red)sit back and defend you would'nt
  have scored if we were still playing now,no good bleating on about ifs and
  buts you lost take it on your mackem chin and get over it.next time you write
  a report make sure you actually watch the game!!!!
