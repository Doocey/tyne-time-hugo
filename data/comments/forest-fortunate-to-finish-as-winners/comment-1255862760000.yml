message: "What a biased report, did you watch the game, no wonder other fans want to see you fail. Can you please advise why you think Dexters goal was dubious, clearly he was on side and it was a great goal.\r\n\r\nWe were all over you first half, created plenty of chances and you would of thought we were the top dogs in the league, in the second half you saw another side of Forest, we digged in to get the win. You didn't really create any decent chances from all the possession you had. Nolan Goal was offside FACT, why would you get that decision some weeks, offside is offside and it was the correct decision. Newcastle are lacking a creative spark, afterall you haven't scored for a few games now.\r\n\r\nGreat performance forest, hard luck Geordies, best team won on the day, I remember in the 90's when you came down here when you was going for the league and you drew to hand the title to Man United. If memory serves me right your fans didn't take that result gracefully either.\r\n\r\nYOU REDS"
