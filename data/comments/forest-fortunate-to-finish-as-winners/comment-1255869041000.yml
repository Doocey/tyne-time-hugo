  Why is it that these so-called big teams cannot be gracious and say they were
  beaten by a better team on the day. They always go on about chances they
  nearly had, well if we go on about chances, we could have easily been 5 up
  after the first half, Camp had the easiest first half he probably has ever
  had.  Hope it knocks them down a peg or two - anyone can beat anyone in this
  league.  An unbiased report would probably have not got every Forest fan's
  back up!! Well done Forest.
