message: "Most ridiculous report I have ever read. I'm not even going to attempt to address all of your points as each one is quite frankly wrong. Were you at the game? \r\n\r\n\"The first half wasnâ€™t anything special\"....it was a superb performance by Forest that merited at least one goal which was only dubious if you've decided that all the replays are wrong. Just as a 'legitimate' Newcastle goal was ruled correctly offside.\r\n\r\nAn 'average' side does not win 4 games in a row."
