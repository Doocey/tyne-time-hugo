message: "Hey reds, chill. We won because we were the better side over 90 minutes. Newcastle are discovering that the season is so looooong in this division, and a great start means very little. You can be in the bottom 3 in December, and in the play-offs come April - there is no \"big 4\" outside the Premier league.\r\n\r\nSure, this is a bit of a biased report - but they have a lot to learn this year. If they fail to get promotion this year, they'll be wiser the next. We were there once...\r\n\r\nYOOOOOUUUUUUU RRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEDDDSSSSS!!!!!"
