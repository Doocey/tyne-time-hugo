message: "I like Newcastle United, I like the passion of their fans, I like the fact that they have always represented all that's good about the game, however, it's quite a large however, the claim that Newcastle are the biggest club in the league is quite frankly inaccurate.\r\n Forest know only to well that previous glories mean absolutely nothing when battling for results, look a Leeds United, they make no claims about being even the biggest club in the 3rd tier, why would they afford themselves to such deluded nonsense and disrespectful remarks? this merely ensures the opposition put in that little extra effort that can win games. Also maybe I'm naive, but looking at Forest's performance especially in the first half they most certainly were not the fortunate to come out the winners. I honestly hope Newcastle are promoted this year, not least to appease their fans ego's but to rid the championship of it's \"Biggest Club\". \r\nNottingham Forest have integrity, WFT does Newcastle United have exactly?"
