message: "you condesending set of supporters, no wonder you never have a succesfull team you think you are far better than everyone else. Results show something a lot diferently so who is right.\r\nForest played you off the park for 45 minutes,you controlled the second half for 30 minutes and the rest was stalemate. Your goal was offside, the TV proved it, you hit the post so did we. Get a life and grow up"
