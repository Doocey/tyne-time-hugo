message: "I agree with this article, we probably were unlucky in the second half but equally it could have been all over at half time. For those comments that have been left regarding \"deluded\" geordie fans, well actually you couldn't be more wrong. As a season ticket holder i know i speak for the majority of fans when i say we know we are not good enough to be in the premier league, we know we do not have a divine right to be there and we know it is going to be very difficult to get back up there. We also know that it is the number of supporters we take to away games and have every other week at St James's Park that makes us a \"big\" club. Nothing else. Its the media and fans of other clubs, who for some reason spend half their lives reading about Newcastle United rather than their own teams (says something doesn't it :-)that keep saying we are a big club and should be in the premier league. Well on last years performances, no we shouldn't. On the players the club bought in and sold, no we shouldn't. So don't worry, Newcastle fans are under no illusions we are just going to enjoy this season and hope Mike Ashley does the right thing and gets out of toon. Just one last thing- of all the away games Newcastle have had this season so far, the attendances have been the highest of the season when Newcastle have been to town. I remember Ian Holloway after Blackpool beat Newcastle saying- \"message to the fans, you were brilliant tonight, but where were you last week and where will you be next week\". \r\nHmmm funny that!!"
