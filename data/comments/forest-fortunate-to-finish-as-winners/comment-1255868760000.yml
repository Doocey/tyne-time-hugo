  You are biased mate. Sorry but you are. How can you claim our goal was
  "dubious"? The replay showed your right back playing Blackstock onside.
  Then.....dear lord you claim you were denied a "blatant legit goal". Sorry but
  again the replay showed he was offside. Also loved your "had Nile Ranger
  pelted his header into the back of the net, it would be a very different
  analysis". Yeah well if we had burried you in the first half like we should
  have, we would also be looking at a very different analysis. Face it, we were
  on top in the first half and you were on top in the second. I have nothing
  against Newcastle but your fans are alot like ours were about 10yrs ago. Still
  claiming to be a big club and moaning about being every opposition's cup
  final.
