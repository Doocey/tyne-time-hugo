  Thought your previous article was a good one but this is total garbage. Forest
  were head and shoulders above the geordies in the first half. In my book they
  did enough in the first half not to warrant defeat. NUFC had all the
  possession in the 2nd half but no end product. They were rather tame to say
  the least. The big club lable would sicken me if i were a geordie. Youve never
  really won a deal i dont need to remind you of what we have won. All that
  makes you what you perceive to be a big club is geographical location. Because
  at the end of the day as forest fans were singing youve never won f**k all
