  Thanks for the interest Se√°n but I'm not at this time anyways, looking for any
  extra staff.

  There has been quite a lot of interest in this position but I haven't had the
  need to get more people on board.

  You can leave your email address here and I might get back to you :)


  Re Dave Baldwin :

  Thanks Dave, yeah we were in some sense lucky to get the draw but our second
  half dominance could have well won it for us too. Martins missed a couple in
  both half's. Anyways thanks joining the new Tyne Time and if you don't mind me
  asking what is your profession? It sounds quite good :)


  Alan :

  Yeah I've done the mobile website for all mobile users as it's coming a big
  thing nowadays. Hope you like it and I really hope I can be writing about
  Summer targets soon with safety guaranteed!
