  People seem to forget that Ferguson has a great record at Aberdeen before he
  took over at Man Utd hence the reason he was given time, Pardew has won 1
  Johnstone Paint Trophy and has had three different teams in relegation
  trouble. He doesn't deserve any time and should be given the bullet after the
  Aresenal game.
