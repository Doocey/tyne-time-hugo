  Comparing Pardew to Fergusons bad season at Man Uand Moyes bad season at
  Everton is silly. Pardew couldn't tie either of those men's shoe laces. He is
  negative and his excuses are lame. His stupid comments about losing to Arsenal
  4-0 and not qualifying for Europe proove how much of a prat the man is. If we
  hold onto him for another season, we will go down. We are lucky QPR are shite
  because even are performance yesterday was painful to watch. Taxi for Pardew!
