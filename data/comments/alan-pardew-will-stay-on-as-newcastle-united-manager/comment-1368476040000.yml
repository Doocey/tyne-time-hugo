  A proven background would secure more time alas the previous poster is right
  and Pardew must carry the can,the club must gather momentum and move forward
  with a proven manager in Benitez who has what it takes and can steady a
  faltering ship and also work with the inherited squad as he has done at
  chelsea this season
