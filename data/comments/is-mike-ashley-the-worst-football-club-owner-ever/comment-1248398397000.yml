  Mike Ashley has no rivals in his ability to make the wrong choice when he has
  had the choice of two decisions - Wise or Keegan, a left back or Xisco, a
  competent CEO or Llambias, a healthy manager or Kinnear, appointing a
  replacement or soldiering on, Shearer or no one, sell the club or not, tell
  the world there have been offers on the table or deny it. The man has been a
  total disaster who lost us Keegan, our Premiership place and probably Shearer
  too. He might be fit to own a football club as required by the football
  authorities but there are no such credentials with Newcastle fans. Sooner gone
  the better. It has been an expensive mistake for him and us.
