message: "You make this sound as if it`s the equivalent of a house or car for sale here, I`m afraid it`s not quite that simple.\r\nWe are talking about one hundred million (can you get your head around that amount)which is not exactly chump change.\r\nIn the present economic conditions that amounts to a lotta dosh.\r\nFew if any investors from either UK/Europe or USA, would be willing to put that kind of money into such an investment, there are much better deals available.\r\nIt appears our only hope would be from either the oil rich middle east or an Asian investor.\r\nYes the club has a certain attraction, great fans (as far as attendance is concerned)state of the art stadium and certainly not the debt of a Man. U. or L/Pool.\r\nHowever neither do we have the earning potential of either club and being located almost three hundred miles from London is a negative, that and being a second tier team.\r\nIt`s essential we make a return to the top level in order to be considered salable, therefoe it`s unlikely we will have new ownership prior to next summer.\r\nSomething else to consider is the actual asking price, is it simply 100m. or are there hidden costs/debts, apparently most of us are in the dark and tend to make statements based solely on supposition.  \r\nSo far it appears most bidders, either could`nt come up with the money or wanted to do it with a certain amount of hard cash and the rest in loans, mostly shysters looking for a deal.\r\nSoh ! lets see what happens next summer."
