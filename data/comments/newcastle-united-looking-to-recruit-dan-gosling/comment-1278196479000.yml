  My dear Magpies, you are a big club, and most true fans are pleased to see you
  back in the top tier, but there is no need to slag off a team who are actually
  trying to live within their means unlike the rest of the premiership. Yes we
  are behind the likes of Spuds and Citeh in spending power, but we will not go
  broke if our owners walk away unlike most other teams (see Liverpoo, Chelski,
  Man Ure etc) and you of all people should know that poor financing can be
  disastrous. The fact that you actually admit that he cannot get in to our side
  yet would walk in to yours (he would play more regularly) admits we are a
  better side and shoots down your own argument in flames.  Now please go away
  and save up for a colour shirt instead of that awful black and white
  number.....
