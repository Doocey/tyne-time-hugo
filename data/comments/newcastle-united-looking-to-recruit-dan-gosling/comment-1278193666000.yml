  everton on the slide mate, your losing players faster then water goes down a
  plug hole.  lescott and andy johnson have already seen the light.  arteta and
  pienaar will soon be on there way.  you had the chance to become a top4 team
  and blew it, your broke, and city, spurs and villa have all overtaken
  you.<br><br>the only way for your team son is down
