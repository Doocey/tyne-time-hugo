  Lets see who finishes higher in the league then, Everton or the newly promoted
  Newcastle. You Geordies are unbelievably delusional,you have only been back in
  the league for a matter of minutes and now you&#39;re all talking about how
  you deserve to take an established top 8 teams players against their will.
  This attitude is why I and many other fans up and down the country laughed
  when your self regarding club got relegated. As you may or may not know, your
  city only has one club, Liverpool has two, hence why Newcastle get bigger
  gates. If you want to talk about big clubs, then Everton have won the league 9
  times compared to your 4.If Everton want Gosling to stay, he will, but at the
  moment he is injured and wouldn&#39;t get a sniff of our starting 11.You talk
  about Everton&#39;s best players leaving, Johnson and Lescott etc, but the
  truth is all our quality is still at the club.Thankyou in anticipation for the
  6 points we will receive next season and good luck avoiding relegation.
