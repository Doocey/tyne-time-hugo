  playing for a time that will be relegated will not allow him to make a name
  for himself.People talk about Rodwell as a future England international
  because he has the talent to become one. They say the same about Wilshere at
  Arsenal. The fact is, both are young and need time to mature.As i see it,
  there aren&#39;t many 19 year olds starting week in week out in the Premier
  League
