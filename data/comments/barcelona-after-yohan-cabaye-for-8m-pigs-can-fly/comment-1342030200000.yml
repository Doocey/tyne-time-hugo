message: "Fact is, the London press are absolutely livid Newcastle haven't crashed and burned, and are desperate our success stories don't stay at Newcastle. Just the other day on Talk Sh*t radio, a typical woman reporter she was as bad as you'd imagine, but still nowhere near as bad as the BBC \"wimmin\" TV and Radio \"sport\" reporters who know less about football than I know about Nuclear Physics - well, this \"Georgie\" or whatever had been doing a show called Transfer tavern or whatever and had on the subject of Newcastle said she was \"astounded\" Cisse, Cabaye and Tiote were still at Newcastle. The Londonj mentality is worse now than at any time in history. Arrogance off the graph. And this stupid cow was a prime example.\nBut they are genuinely furious Newcastle have great players who are only going to get better.\_\nThey HAVE to sabotage - it's an intolerable position - what happens if Newcastle actually WIN something ? They have to sabotage !"
