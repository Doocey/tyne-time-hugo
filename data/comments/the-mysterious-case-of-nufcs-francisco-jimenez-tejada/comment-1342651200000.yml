Carroll doesnt feature in Liverpools plans but he will fly out to USA wen he returns from his euro break.\n\nSeriously the guy cant be that bad for god sake we had Kuqi on our bench an he got minutes i would have preferred to give Xisco a shot we are paying his wages anyway try get some value for money ......\_\n\nnext i will guess geolf777 reply ..... NO one will match his wages.... yea we heard you the 1st time\_"
