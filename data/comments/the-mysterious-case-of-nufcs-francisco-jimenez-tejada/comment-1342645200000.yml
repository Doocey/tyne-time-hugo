  Hi, I'm not an ITK nor do I know Xisco, but i do know some of his family, and
  his best friend. He comes from a small place called Santa Ponca in Majorca,
  where I spend at least 6-8 weeks of the summer. He comes from a family with
  money already, from owning restaraunts and bars, and he has a very nice house
  out there. I am quite friendly with his best friend, all be it that I only
  know him as he also owns a big bar out there, which I spend most of my nights
  in. I often ask him about Xisco, and he reckons he is going to Dubai to pay
  his football. Don't take this as gospel, I'm only letting you know what he has
  told his friend.
