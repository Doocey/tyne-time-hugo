  So you think the club has been happy to keep paying him 50 grand a week for
  four years without him anywhere near the first team, and haven't tried to
  offload him? Surely to god you don't think any reason other than money is the
  reason he's still here? He's been at the club under 5 managers and not one of
  them has rated him! He hasn't even been anything other than a fringe player
  for the clubs he's been loaned to!

  I'm sure Reading wont be contacting you for a scouting role in the near
  future, and as for your 1million valuation, the guy will be a free agent at
  the end of the season, and will struggle to get a permant contract at any
  club, even without a fee!
