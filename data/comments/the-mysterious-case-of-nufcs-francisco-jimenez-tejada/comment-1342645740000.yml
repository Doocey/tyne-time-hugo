  I'm the guy who said he's on £50,000 a week, did you read that?


  If/When he leaves, he's not going to be on £50k a week. You seem to think
  he'll bide his time and run out his contract which he may do, but it's very
  unlikely. It's likely he'll leave at the earliest opportunity, I certainly
  would if I was Xisco. The problem is down to the fact no clubs rate him.


  As for understanding facts - your opinion isn't fact so come down off the high
  horse.
