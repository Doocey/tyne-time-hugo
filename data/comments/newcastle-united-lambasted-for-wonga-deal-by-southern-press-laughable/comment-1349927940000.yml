  This is the only reply i can give to this article. So here goes.


  Brilliantly said my friend. There i did it. You are perfectly correct in
  saying what you said, there has been a decline for years in the morals of
  football to the point were the whole league was sponsored by a brewery and now
  by a Bank accused of ripping everyone and its mother off. As for the southern
  media, no wonder some of them were banned from St James' and the training
  ground. They don't talk favourably about north east football, more so NUFC,
  but what do you expect from an area of the country that claims the England
  team as its own. If they had there way the ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE would stop
  as far up as manchester and thats it. Well said Ed.
