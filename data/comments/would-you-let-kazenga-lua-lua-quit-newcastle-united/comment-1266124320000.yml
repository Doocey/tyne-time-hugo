  He's only just turned 19 and he's been playing in the reserves for 3 years, he
  could still have a future but needs to be given a chance. Personally I think
  he's an exciting player who runs at defences and uses pace, trickery and
  creativity in his game. The criteria of pace, trickery and creativity doesn't
  fit whith Hughton so I don't think he'll be given a chance whilst he's in
  charge.
