message: "I like the lad, I wish we had the chance to use him more often, reminds me a lot of Martins, especially the goals he has scored for the reserves, really want to see the others he has scored -\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgC47wGihtE\r\n\r\nWould be a shame to see him go personally, but I'd rather not see his career go to waste at Newcastle.. on another loan we've done, I want Zamblera to come back, he was awesome on Fifa."
