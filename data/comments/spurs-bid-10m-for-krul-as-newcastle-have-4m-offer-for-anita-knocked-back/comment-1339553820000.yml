message: "\_Hahahahaha.... retard.\n\nI can assure you that 90%+ of Spurs fans didn't want the Olympic stadium. Especially in it's current form, we couldnt play somewhere with so little soul. Leave that to the other teams across town.\n\nSo every summer there is constant media links of Modric, Bale, VdV to Europes elite. Adebayor has said he wants to sort out a deal to stay with us. Even our young right back who has played 1 season with us is being linked to Real Madrid. \n\nWe have a whole reserve team of internationals and our plans for a new stadium have received planning permission...\n\nSo not really sure what you are talking about there... You've had a great season, but don't get ahead of yourselves. The amount the top teams are investing, it's hard for anyone aiming for a top 6 finish."
