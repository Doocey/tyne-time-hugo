  £25m for a keeper??? You only have one player worth more than £12m and that's
  Cisse. 1 season sharing your hob nobs with the elite is not an arrival. You
  punched above your weight and had incredible season but perspective. Arsenal,
  Spurs and Liverpool will not have such inconsistency again. Well, Liverpool
  might but that still puts you behind city, united, arsenal, spurs and Chelsea.
  You're best players stay yours all the while none of the above want them.
