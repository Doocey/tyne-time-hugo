  Are you actually having a laugh lol! £25m for Tim Krul. Considering we could
  get someone better like Vorm of Swansea or Stekelenburg of Roma for £15m why
  would we pay that stupid amount of money? First of all, he is not good enough
  for Spurs, secondly he comes from a second-rate club and thirdly we have
  better options. Carry on playing fifa mate!
