  Fair enough, but with all due respect to Spurs, your own star players are just
  as vulnerable to clubs that can guarantee champions league year in year out.
  I've noticed that Spurs and Liverpool fans in particular are over-keen to try
  and put us in "our place" because your own clubs are higher on the pecking
  order but still vulnerable to someone else coming up and upsetting the
  "established order". Fact is some of our players might leave, but why should
  they go to Spurs when they can go to bigger teams like Man City, Chelsea etc?
  Spurs simply aren't big enough to come in and take our players.
