  £25m for Krul? Are you high? As good as he was last season, there is no way
  he's worth £25m!

own to mid-table. Krul is a fantastic keeper who's come up through
  the Newcastle ranks, plus the ink is barely dry on his new contract, so no way
  is he worth £10 million, or anywhere near that. Sorry Yids, you're just not
  big enough to take him off us.
