  I don't support either but can't stand spurs fans. Always up themselves and
  thinking Spurs are better than they are.


  They're giving it large on here but go on any of their forums and most of them
  want bagpuss out, the only manager to give Spurs any recent success. What
  deluded fans.


  Twitch will leave, Modric wants to and Spurs will not replace with similar
  quality.


  No way 4th next year and then it's bye bye bale and hello mid table.


  Spurs are a laughing stock at the moment and they know it. Levy is even
  risking ruining a deal on Dutch league player of the year over a couple of
  warranted mill, as if he'll pay for krul!!!
