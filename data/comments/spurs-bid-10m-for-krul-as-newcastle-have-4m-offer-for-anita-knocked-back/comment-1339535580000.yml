  5under1and paid 10mill for Gordon who was older, unproven in a decent league,
  poor injury record just cos of his potential.  So 5 years later when prices
  are higher why would we sell krill for 10 million. There is no doubt a top
  prem proven young keeper is worth at least 17 mill the extra 8mill is what
  we'd ask just to sweeten the deal as we know his value is only going up up up,
  if he carries on at the rate he is he can and will be in the top 5 keepers in
  Europe! He isn't far off now!! Yous do business the same ie berba!! He wasn't
  worth over 30 but you didn't need to sell and screwed them over. The same as
  we will to anyone on long deals, we have no problems getting rid of players
  for small amounts when they want off or on short deals, Guthrie free, Barton
  free, Nolan 4mill, Enrique 6. Swings and roundabouts!!
