  We're just saying that with out any debt, and a steady ship at the moment, we
  have no need to sell. He may be worth £15m now, but we don't have any need to
  sell, we don't have a replacement who comes close IMO, therefore it will take
  an offer as crazy as AC's 35m was from the bindippers to even get a reply. So
  £25m it will have to be. So that's what he's worth to us-if he's not worth
  that to spurs then look elsewhere.
