  Do some research before you write so much rubbish. Spurs do not have a huge
  wage bill and Levy has made us one of the best sides in the League due to
  controlling the finances. Finally I think you'll find we would fill our new
  stadium as we have 5 year waiting list for season tickets. I hope Harry stays
  but I think that Modric will go this season which will be a big blow.
