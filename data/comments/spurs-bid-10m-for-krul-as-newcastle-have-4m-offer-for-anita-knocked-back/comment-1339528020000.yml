message: "It doesn't matter what you think he is 'worth'. Newcastle don't need to sell and Krul doesn't want to leave. So clubs either have to offer crazy money or they are wasting their time.\_\nAnyway, if i was a Spurs fan i'd be more concerned with trying to keep Modric, Bale etc... at the moment. The tides could well be turning."
