message: "Man u paid £17m for De Gea so Krul worth at least £20m.\n\nNufc wont sell him in the next 5 years. \nThey have 18 year old Jak Alnwick (younger bro of spuds Ben) to come in the future and a really good 14 year old keeper in Freddie Woodman who has already played for the reserve team.\n\_Nufc might sell Krul in 2017 for £25m if either of those two lads are ready to take over.\_ "
