  That sounds more likely - although imo Krul a good deal better than Vorm who i
  wouldn't really want.


  Really does depend on whether an offer is ever put in that is too big for the
  owner to reject - and Spurs aren't really in the habit of putting in 'too good
  to refuse' offers !.


  Your fantastic 5th place and our failure to grab 3rd has probably scuppered
  any deal though in all honesty.
