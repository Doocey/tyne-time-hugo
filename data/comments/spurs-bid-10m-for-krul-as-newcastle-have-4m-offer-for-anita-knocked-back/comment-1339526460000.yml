  As a Spurs fan i would love Krul at WHL but agree with you when you say £10m
  is woefully undervaluing him.I'd be happy for us to pay £18-£20m,but even then
  i wouldn't be confident of him leaving you just yet (probably play with you
  another year and then assess his future based on your progress).
