  You could argue, they way the league stands now, no one is sure for a CL place
  finish in the league. Who would have thought Chelsea would finish 6th? Or
  Liverpool? They have both invested huge amounts in recent years. As have city.
  M Utd you expect to always be up there, but their squad isn't as dominating as
  it has been in past, so maybe they could miss out..Spurs missed out, even
  finishing 4th. Arsenal were lucky this year too.. It could all change next
  year. Will be interesting, just hope Spurs keep what we have in the squad and
  add a couple here and there where needed.
