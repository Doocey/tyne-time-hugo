  Here Gazz - your best players aint even yours man! wave bye bye to Adybyeor.
  If someone wants to buy one of our players they need to pay what we want for
  him (not what hes worth) - unless the player himself wants to go - which Krul
  doesnt. Ashely turned down £30m then £35m for Carroll - it was only when
  Carroll handed in a transfer request did we accept. THATS GOOD BUSINESS! And
  Cabaye isnt worth over £12m isnt he? did you see run run rings around Gerrard
  and Parker *Englands finest* - pipe down YID.
