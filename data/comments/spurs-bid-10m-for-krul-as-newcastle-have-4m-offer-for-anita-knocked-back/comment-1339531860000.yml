  Oh dear, you're missing the point. What you don't seem to understand is that
  because of some very wise buying and some very long term contracts Newcastle
  are in a strong position when people (supposedly) some in for our players- to
  the extent that we can comand a price that would make it daft not to sell. Our
  owner and team obviously have got to the position where we tie people up for a
  good few years and then consider selling if we could improve the squad by
  doing so or are offered a price which would make that all worthwhile. So in
  reality, an offer of about 25 mil could be accepted (not because that is what
  we all think Krul is worth (you moron) but because that would justify the
  rigmarole of selling him). And for the record, Newcastle fans are not deluded,
  do not expect to be established top 5 now and do not think we are a 'massive'
  club - it's just idiots like you who maintain that view of what we (don't)
  think. We have an excellent record in the prem bar one relegation and (without
  checking) I believe we have appeared in the Champions League more times than
  Tottenham.
