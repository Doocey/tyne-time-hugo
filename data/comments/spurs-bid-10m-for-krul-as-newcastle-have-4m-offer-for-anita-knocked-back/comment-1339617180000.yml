  Please ady was by no means our best player, he has the same ball control as
  Peter crouch, can score a goal and create the odd goal but misses more. Krul
  is defo worth more than £10 mill but nowhere near £25mil, cabaye is a good
  player and u will be lucky if u can keep him for another year. U guys need to
  make sure you don't do a hull nxt season, cos if u had to deal with the
  injuries we had to cope with it is more than plausible.
