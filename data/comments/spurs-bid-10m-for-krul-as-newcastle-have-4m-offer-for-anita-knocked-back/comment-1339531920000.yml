message: "How you can say he would be coming from a second rate club is beyond me. Newcastle currently and historicly is on a par with Tottenham. The last few seasons have not been so good for us but your own club has had many a spell in the wilderness. Tim Krul is currently pushing Steklenburg hard for the number one shirt in Holland (world cup finalists) and Vorm is being kept outta the squad. You may even\_find Krul as the number one for the next match. I feel for your club as the team play nice football and the club is run well but your fans are far too big for the boots considering your a team that has never finished higher than 4th in the Prem. I have to hope Harry leaves you lot and the good old days of you languishing in the bottom half of the table returns."
