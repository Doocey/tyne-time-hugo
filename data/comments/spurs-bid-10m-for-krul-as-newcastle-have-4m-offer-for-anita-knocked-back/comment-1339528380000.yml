message: "Wrong. 2 seasons actually. Also he's 24 which means he has another 15 years on his career. He played a huge part in our 5th place finish and\_ you say \"Holland's second keeper\" as if Holland is some pushover underdog team instead of world cup finalists. Fact is Krul would be the first-choice keeper for any number of nationalities and he's years off his peak.\n\nBut all of this doesn't really matter. I want Krul to stay at Newcastle, so if you think he's only worth 8 million, then look somewhere else because he's not leaving for that."
