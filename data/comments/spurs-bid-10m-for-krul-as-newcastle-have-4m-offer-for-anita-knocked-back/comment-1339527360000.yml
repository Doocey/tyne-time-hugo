message: "With all due respect to Newcastle,Spurs are definitely big enough to lure any of your players if we offered enough for them - you've had one great season and finished a fantastic 5th (after relegation).We've been 4th,5th,4th so quite clearly are an established top 5 side.\n\nI'm not saying any of your players would push for moves to Spurs,but should Spurs come in for them they would almost certainly choose to join us....and before you come back with a reference to the size of your crowds blah blah blah,remember Spurs are\_building\_a new ground which will be ready in 3 or 4 years time."
