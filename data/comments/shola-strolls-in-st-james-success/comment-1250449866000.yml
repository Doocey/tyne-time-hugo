  Now i dont want to be seen as a miserable sod but firstly it was a great win (
  well done Shola )and 3 points are 3 points but if we put this game in
  perspective Reading finished 12th last year in the championship so an
  impressive win was what we would have expected also if Ashley stays ( and it's
  looking more likely ) i hope he's going to make some of the money hes pocketed
  over the last few weeks available to buy some players get in touch with Alan (
  Shearer ) and beg him to take the managers job and let him get stuck in
  because there's still an awful lot needs putting right yet yes a great win
  buts lets not get complacent
