message: "We have to get out of this thing about buying \"ready made\". If we are going to be successful we have to show not only that we can buy at £4-5m and make a player look like at £15m player, we also have to take juniors and make them into £10m and then £15m players.\_\n\nRight now we have 10 players from the youth team who are putting their toes in the premier league water. Success for me will be three or more of them becoming first choice players by the end of the season. Example, Bigi, example Sammy, example Shane.\_\n\nSo do I want a defensive midfielder? No. We have loads anyway (Anita, Bigi, Perch).\nDo I want a full back? Last year \"yes\" to replace Simpson (sadly), but now \"no\" because I think Shane will do the job.\_\nDo I want another striker? Possible, but only if Demba goes, and let's all hope he doesn't.\nDo I want a centre back? Now \"yes\". But ask again if Good looks, well, good.\n\n"
