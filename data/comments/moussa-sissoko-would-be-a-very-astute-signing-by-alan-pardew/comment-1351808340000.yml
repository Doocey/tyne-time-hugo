  "We are pretty OK when it comes to midfielders regards the quantity, but 

  there’s no harm adding another one; especially if it’s for a player like
   Moussa"

  Yeah why not maybe we could field an entire team of central midfielders who
  could all play off the 1 midfielder we crave - an attacking playmaking type
  like Cabaye used to be, at Lille :(
