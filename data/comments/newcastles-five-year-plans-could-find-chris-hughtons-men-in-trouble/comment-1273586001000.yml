  Even if there will be funds to spend on players why put out  statement that
  can be read so negativly "No Capital outlay". Its seems Ashley and his
  advisers have stirrred up unnecessary trouble by their consistently poor PR
  skills. If this is all done to scare of agents this will backfire badly as
  they will advise their players not to go anywhere near Newcastle because of
  the obvious instability at the top.
