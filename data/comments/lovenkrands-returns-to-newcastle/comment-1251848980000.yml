  Just what we expected really, very dissapointed i just hope the guys in the
  squad can avoid injuries because there's an awful long way to go to the next
  transfer window and i just hope all this good work hasn't been in vain oh BTW
  have you noticed it's all gone very quiet on the Barry Moat takeover no
  surprise there either
