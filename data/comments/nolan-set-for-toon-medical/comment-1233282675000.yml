  We needed a strong midfielder like Nolan before Barton was injured.


  Now with the Barton injury we are no further forward than we were before the
  City game, even with Nolan. We need ANOTHER midfielder as well as Nolan for us
  to move forward.


  I agree a RB, LB and a striker would be nice too, its easy to get greedy!
