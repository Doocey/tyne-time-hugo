  Well i think today just about showed where are team is really at the moment we
  need new strong prem quality players to come in, there is no way we will get
  automatic promotion if s.taylor, bambi and simpson are out for a few weeks
  it's our defence that has kept us where we are not our prolific scoring
  ability, we need 2 or 3 good defenders and at least 1 quality striker with
  pace.
