message: "Hmm, injuries to two key players and a beating from our closest rivals, with forest steadily marching up the table, does not bode well for our guaranteed promotion hopes.\r\nOh yes but it was a weakened cup side and our league position was`nt effected.\r\nTrue but it raises the question, are we that confident we can achieve promotion with the present squad ?\r\nHave to say without S.Taylor and Shola, makes it tougher and had we not been so cheap we could be looking at a decent backup CD, who now appears to be heading for Wearside, plus a striker.\r\nThe reality is we should have never been relegated to begin with, we had enough talent to have survived, but the chaos and uncertainty,led to a lack of cohesion amongst an already disgruntled and divided side, with half the side wanting out.\r\nIt became obvious that top management were out of their depth on what to do to stop the rot and not only sold some of our top players but in desperation hired an ex star with no expierience in management, the rest is history.\r\nAt present we are in what some would regard as a team almost guaranteed  promotion, sure, but a few key injuries could quickly put the kibosh on our promotional aspirations.\r\nAnother gamble by our fearless leader who refuses to put his hand in his pocket to strengthen the side and ensure we go up.\r\nHis loss, it will be harder to go through another season in the second tier, with no parachute payment, possibly lower crowds and a team where those PL quality players will be long gone.     \r\nWe still have time to bring in some quality to the side, dont make the same gamble as last year Mike !"
