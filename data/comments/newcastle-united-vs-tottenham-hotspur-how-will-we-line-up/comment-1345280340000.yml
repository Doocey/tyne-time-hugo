  Krul
  Simpson - S.Taylor - Coloccini - Santon
  Cabaye - Tiote - Jonas

  Ben Arfa - Ciss√© - Ba

  This is the best team when everyone is fit.
  Marveaux, Anita and Ameobi as subs.
  But I think maybe Simpson will struggle against Bale..
  I doubt that Ben Arfa will start, and I guess Marveaux will
  play as left winger. I do NOT want Obertan in the team,
  he is shite.
