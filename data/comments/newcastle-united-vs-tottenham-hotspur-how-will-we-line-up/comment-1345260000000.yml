message: "You could be right. Pardew did say he was focusing on midfield this season.\_\n\nControl midfield, you win the game - words from the man himself, if I remember correctly.\n\nObertan was someone who I do think might be close to the first team tomorrow, but Marveaux has been brilliant all pre-season and deserves the chance.\nGabby for the remaining 20 up against a tiring full-back would be ideal, for me at least."
