message: "Spurs have a plethora of talent in midfield. Therefore I expect Pardew to start with (dependant on fitness)\_\nKrul\n\nSimpson Taylor Coloccini Santon\nJonas Tiote Anita\nCabaye\nCisse Ba\n\nIf we are getting overrun by Spurs (possible) 5-man \_midfield, drop Cabaye back with Ba slotting in just behind Cisse. As was most often the case last season, us getting the first goal is vital. An early goal for the visitors could see us struggle to recover."
