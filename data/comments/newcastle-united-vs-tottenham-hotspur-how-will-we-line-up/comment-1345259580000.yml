  Nice piece, i actually think (given a fit midfield) Pards will try boss
  midfield by throwing Anita in and telling him to break up play and pass
  simple. I also think me may rest Simpson incase we do need to sell, if so
  santon moves to RB and Guti moves to LB.. Enough blabbering my team is....


  Krul

  Santon Taylor Colo Raylor 

  Tiote Anita

  Obertan Cabaye Gutierrez

  Shola


  Unless im forgetting someone...
