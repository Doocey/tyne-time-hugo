message: "Be more ambitious - newcastle 3-1 \_- sick of cautious comments, we are pushing on from 5th and villas boas is about to be handed his ass again, first manager to be sacked odds? got to be worth a shot. Tottenham will be found out this year i think and lucky to make top 6.Ameobi should not be let near the starting lineup, rather play anyone else - even ben arfa sitting behind one of the dembas better"
