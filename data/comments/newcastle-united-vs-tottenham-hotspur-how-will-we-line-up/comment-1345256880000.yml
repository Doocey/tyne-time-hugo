  As a Spurs fan I think your article is pretty fair, It was refreshing to see
  Newcastle up there last season along with Spurs, two teams who I think have
  worked hard to get where they are, not just bought their way to the top. It
  would be nice to see Newcastle up there again at the end of this season, 1
  place below spurs of course :-)
