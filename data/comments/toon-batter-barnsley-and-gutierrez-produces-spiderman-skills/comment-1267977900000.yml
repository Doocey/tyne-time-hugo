message: "jim - I think 9 points ahead probably refers to automatic promotion rather than winning the Championship.\r\nThinking about the game, am I the only one who believes that the sending-off would probably have been irrelevant to the result, if not the actual score? I was feeling  before it happened that it was another of those days where patience was needed but we were starting to create a bit, and that once we scored our first we would be in full control. Remember - we have been down to 10 against 11 this season and ended up scoring the winner. Also that our first goal in the Coventry 4-1 wasn't until after 30 minutes or more - I think we have been spoilt a bit by a lot of early goals lately."
