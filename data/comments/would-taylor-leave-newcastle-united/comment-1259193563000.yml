message: "I dont think its down to Taylor any more. Its Ashley, so I fear the worse 4.5 Mill and we get Sol Cambell. Got to say I believe young Kadar is coming on, although that ,means Simpson will be heading back to Manc Utd.\r\n\r\nSo Out - Taylor, Simpson and that KidnooneIamafootballer back to the orginal clubs \r\n\r\nIn - Campell\r\n\r\nEquals Ashley happy saving Â£10 k a week and 4.5 millon for the casino. and 42000 fans even more fuming than Cherly Cole after Ashley returns after a night out with the Chelsea players with a hickie and hotel room keys in his pocket.\r\n\r\nNo diffrence really - both loyal Geordie - who need to dump the cockney twat !!!!"
