message: "Why would he want to leave if he helps us back into the EPL and has PL games again next season.... I'm sure there's still a few years left on his contract so he can't really be forced out and as said Everton are not exactly rolling in the money.\r\n\r\nI also believe Simpson will stay at Newcastle (signed in January)\r\n\r\nBasically paper talk, no more imo."
