message: "No he won't.  \r\n\r\nI think the papers, as usual, are adding 2+2 and getting 5.  Moyes is ex PNE manager and still lives in the area; he still gets to as many of their games as he can.  He is also close friends with Irvine too. \r\n\r\nEverton are strapped for cash and heavily in debt so I canna see him having much money to spend in Jan window."
