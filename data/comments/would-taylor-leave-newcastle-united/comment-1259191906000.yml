message: "There have been better clubs than Everton who have shown interest in Taylor over time.\r\nHe has been very upfront in voicing his preference to stay with his boyhood club, here in the Toon.\r\nWhether he has changed his mind or MA sees $$$$ we can only guess.\r\nHopefully it`s the former of the two, as he is developing into a fine defender, who can be dangerous on set plays, being decent in the air.\r\nWould you  as a defender want to come up against both he and Carroll, plus Nolan (all big and decent in the air) on set pieces?"
