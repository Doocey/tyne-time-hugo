  On the whole it sounds like a great idea a club owned by the supporters but
  buying the club will be the easy part i think the problems may arise on
  sustaining the club having said that i'm sure the guys would have a chance to
  try and bring the club back the respect that it deserves after this shower of
  Sh*T have finished having a total disrespect for the club the city and the
  people of Newcastle shame on them
