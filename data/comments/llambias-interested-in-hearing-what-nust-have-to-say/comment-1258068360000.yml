message: "Can we take NUST serious ? have to I suppose as they consist of a vociferous body who appear to be a group willing to take on the NUFC board and owner in a struggle for control of the club.\r\nWill they be successfull ?\r\nVery much doubt it.\r\nWhy ? money, doubt whether they can raise the asking price.\r\nAny group asking me to invest a substantial amount of money in a project, without a prospectus and general guarantees, no thanks !\r\nSure it`s a great ideal, but believe it will end in frustration and recrimination, with an increased division between fan groups and management.\r\nAnother well intentioned attempt, bound for failure."
