  Rubbish form, rubbish results, the togetherness has gone.  A promise of two
  signings in the Jan window and we got a injured player that we won't see much
  of and a none rated player that we will see little of.  Our strike force has a
  purchased price of 1 million.  Our manager says he is good in disapline so
  that lads go clubbing.  Oh and as a personal opinion the manager is tactically
  inept.  


  So far I am not impressed with our latest gobby cockney.  Bring on more bull
  for summer transfer window.
