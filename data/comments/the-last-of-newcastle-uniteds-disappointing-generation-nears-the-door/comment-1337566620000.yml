  Bought as a striker but never scored a goal. Moved to attacking midfield but
  without any pace or incisive passing ability. Did well in the championship as
  a defensive midfielder but when Tiote showed everyone how it should be done,
  we all realised that he was nothing but a bunch of yellow cards and free kicks
  given in bad areas. You can't say that Alan didn't try his best and was not
  passionate but he never recovered from his injury and after that was never
  more than a championship player. I wish him well because he always gave his
  all, but outside of the championship his all was never enough
