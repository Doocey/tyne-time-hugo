message: "Definitely\_still a good player given the chance and the right\_position, Did a fantastic job for the MK Dons with coaching and inspiring the players. despite a past serious leg injury Alan Smith is not scared of going in for the tackle and gets in amongst it with out fear. very good in the air too at times\_especially\_at League one level, would love to see him stay at MK Dons, but that just isn't going to happen. I predict a move to at least a championship side but probably a Prem side. Alan Smith is not finished yet !!"
