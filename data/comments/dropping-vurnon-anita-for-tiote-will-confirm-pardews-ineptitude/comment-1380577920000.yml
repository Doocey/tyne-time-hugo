  Unless we get a result then he will have done his job as a manager (not that I
  expect anything from tonights game) Pardew needs a break, he is hated by a
  fair few fans, regardless what he does and there is a strong suspicion the
  owner cant wait to dump him.  I rate Anita but he needs to shuffle the pack if
  only to show the players they are not safe from being dropped after a bad
  result
