  I think there is a big difference between a bad result and a bad individual
  performance. Yes, shuffle the pack if a player has a stinker but to drop a
  player like anita who has so often been the only shining light in thus team
  does not send out the right message to players. If we get beat off cardiff at
  the weekend do you drop ben arfa for obertan to show the players they are not
  safe? I think not. The only way we are going to get away from the hoofball
  tactics of last season is by having players like anita in the team. He should
  be one of the first names on the team sheet however, under pardew I'm not sure
  this will ever be the case.
