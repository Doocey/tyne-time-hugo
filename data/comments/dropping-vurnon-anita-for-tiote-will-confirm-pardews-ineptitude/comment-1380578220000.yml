  I'm not sure but tonight i wouldnt be suprised to see him go for tiote  over
  anita - certainly doesnt mean hes inept.


  Anita deservedly played against Hull at home, but away to Goodison Tiote may
  be the better choice as a way to cut off marauding full backs to allow ben
  arfa to exploit the space Baines leaves. 


  Anita is a nifty player but being a defensive rock is not his game. 


  Tiote was so sloppy last season and was a liability but lets not be fickle he
  was out with injury alot, he is a beast when hes at his best.
