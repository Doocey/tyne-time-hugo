  But he hasn't - he's dropped Cabaye. Not a bad move away from home, especially
  against a tough side like Everton, and as long ad Tiote plays more like the
  old Tiote.


  He's also dropped Cisse for Gouffran - another brave but wise move.


  Let's hope the players don't let him and us down like they did vs Hull. A
  point would be a very good result.
