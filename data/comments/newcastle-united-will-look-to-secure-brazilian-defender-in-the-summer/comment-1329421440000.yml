  Apparently the offer is for Twente to make and not for Douglas to turn down,
  basically he is under contract for another 2 years, but if Twente accept an
  offer Douglas has to go, its part of his agreement, Twente put this in his
  contract because financially they are not in a great position, this allows
  them to sell for a decent price even if the player doesn't want to leave, its
  like a players sell on clause but in reverse
