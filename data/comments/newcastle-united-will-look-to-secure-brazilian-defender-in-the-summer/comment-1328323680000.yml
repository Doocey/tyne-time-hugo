message: "We could really begin to build a good squad to compete in Europe with snapping up 2-3 free transfers...\n\nPeople like Douglas, Rodallega, Diame , Hoilett all decent players and I'm sure Carr knows some Marveux style signings from France.\_\n\nThere are others like Kalou (who has so much talent and would shine with a proper run) who would also be extremely good on a free but we would suffer from a wage structure."
