  Good job - very pleased - pity we couldn't have tied up Kilgallon too - but
  maybe we now get Matthew for free in the summer. With Kadar looking so good a
  prospect, we probably need just an on-loan center-back through the end of the
  season. Taylor, Coloccini and Kadar have all looked good this season.
