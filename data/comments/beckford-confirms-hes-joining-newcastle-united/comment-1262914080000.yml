message: "Yeah, nice repeat from a fans run amatuer website like goal. In all honesty, why would he ring up goal out of all the media just to say he's off to Newcastle, which is unfortunatly unlikely to be wrong?\r\n\r\nI agree with the Leeds fan, why him, we could of got someone much better for our money. Though I doubt thats going to stop half of you going out and getting Beckford 9 on your tops though while sky interviews the chavs who live outside SJP yet again.\r\n\r\nReally bad signing for us in my opinion, I hope I'm wrong though."
