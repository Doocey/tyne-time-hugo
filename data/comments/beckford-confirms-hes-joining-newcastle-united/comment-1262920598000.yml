  I dont know if beckford would be a good signing but we are crying out for
  someone with pace upfront.Boyd off rangers looks a good player but honestly i
  aint seen much of him,beckford either.Just hope we get a few bodies in cuz we
  are going go through an injury spell this season and wba and forest have
  turned up the heat.See we being linked with rothen as well off PSG.
