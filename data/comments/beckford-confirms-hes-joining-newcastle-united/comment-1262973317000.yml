  Maybe Xisco last season just settling in to the english game, i believe we
  shipped him off too early. He certainly looks more mobile than the other
  strikers. Also for the midfield O'Hara on loan and Cleverley on permanent
  deal. May start producing the football we like to see and add a bit more pace
  to the team
