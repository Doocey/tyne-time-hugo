  Well the question is Icedog, will any buy Xisco?

  We paid Â£5.75m for the lad and he has potential, well I think he does anyway.


  The encouraging news is that we're in the market pretty quickly for players
  for a change. I think we all remember this time last year when nothing was
  done up until the last couple of days and even at that we brought zilch in.
