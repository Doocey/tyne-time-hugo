  Yeah true. However, the amount of other expenses Newcastle United FC incur
  result in huge payments. Saying that, you're right. The fans deserve something
  in the return for their money in the club and not for it to be paid to the
  likes of Geremi who collects Â£58,000 a week for doing nothing.
