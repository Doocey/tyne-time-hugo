  Hartlepool season ticket holder here.


  Luke James has been played more in an out and out striker role (similar to
  Michael Owen but before he lost his pace).


  Very young and raw but scored a couple of cracking goals inc our goal of the
  season. As our youngest ever goal scorer he has bags of potential but I would
  say a couple of years away from a regular in the premiership.


  He's from Amble so wouldn't mind moving back up from the deep south!
