  Ayoze Perez is tipped to be the next Fernando Torres.. he has real pace and
  can turn very quickly with the ball at his feet taking out defenders out of
  the equation in a split second. He has good dribbling skills as well and good
  anticipator about when and where the ball might end up in the box. However, he
  is not yet the polished product and will be good in a back up role this
  season. With more premiership games under his belt, he would be a force to
  reckon with. We still need the proven No.9 as it stands to spearhead the
  attack and one who can drive fear into the hearts of the opposition defenders.
