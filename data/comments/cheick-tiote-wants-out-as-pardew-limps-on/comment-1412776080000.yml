  yeah, only a matter of time before he wants out. not that fussed actually.
  althought id agree he is one of the more senior of the senior members of the
  team and not a good time too lose him, all he is is a big block that protects
  the backline. whenever he tires to get too clever, his pass goes astray, and
  when he has a crack at goal watch out in the stands. he would need to be
  replaced, but we still have anita and colback, and sissoko. if the moneys
  right take it for a 29 year old
