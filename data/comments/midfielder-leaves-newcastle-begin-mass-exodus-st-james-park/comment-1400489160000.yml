  I know when I’m playing footy manager, I don’t sell a player

  till ive signed a replacement. I figure its only smart in case cant get who I
  want, or if I want doesn’t like coming to my club. Agree, a few players need
  to go, but I’d be a bit more comfortable to see an end to the constant rumours
  of linked players and see some deals agreed. If we end up with caulker, then
  lets sell taylor. end up with zaha, then lets sell gabes. We’ve just been
  handed 80mil so its hardly like we need to sell to raise the funds.
