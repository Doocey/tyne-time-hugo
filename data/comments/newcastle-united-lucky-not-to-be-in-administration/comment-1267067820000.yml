message: "I must confess I am pleased to see I am not alone in my views. I would doubt if MA would read this but if he were to take some of comments posted above he may rescue his position at the club and begin to enjoy the new era which is coming.\r\nMany things need to change at the club.\r\nAppointing non executive directors from the true support would act as guidence so the same mistakes are not made.\r\nWe can be a top club again but its going to take a long time to get to that position.\r\nOur performance on the pitch has only shown how poor this league is. We need to start planning long term in a youth policy with players who not only have the skill but the hunger.\r\nNo matter what your views of ma are he hold the key to the new begining."
