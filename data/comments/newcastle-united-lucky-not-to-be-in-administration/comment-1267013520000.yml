message: "The question will always be, would you rather a 'Toon Army Till I Die' group like NUST (without private resources on tap to put emergency supporting loans in place) were in charge or a rich kid like MA who doesn't want to lose his money on his considerable investment?  \r\n\r\nLike a house, it ain't what you pay for it, it's what it costs to put right when the central heating goes wrong or the roof blows off.   Unless NUST have TWICE the face value of the club in the bank they should walk away now, because that is the minimum contingency they will need to guard against the nervous banks seeking administration at the slightest hiccup.  At no time up to MA taking over did NUFC look a viable investment, the wage sheet alone was a testament to the utter incompetence of previous idiot directors throwing millions around at spoilt brat footballers, probably because it felt good to be mixing in those circles.  \r\n\r\n\"A hundred grand a week, no conditions attached, plus another ten grand a week for the gee-gees? I think we can manage that, Michael.\"  \r\n\r\nThis bone-headed profligacy verged on financial negligence; all at the final expense of the season ticket holders, or the expense of the city itself if the club went under.  It never brought a trophy, and simply stored up huge problems for the future, problems that would have sunk the club without a billionaire such as MA as owner.\r\n\r\nWhat the last year has done is reveal the true state of this club to its supporters, and yes we still have the shouters hurling abuse at Ashley (and yes he has been s*** at times) - but a year in the backwaters of Fizzy Pop football has done this club no harm at all if we are brutally honest. And, if we learn to start winning away as well, we might add some genuine silverware to the cabinet - if anyone can remember where the key was last put......"
