message: "Think it`s a combination of the two, yes i`m sure MA wants to protect his investment, who would`nt ?\r\nBut whether he wants to sell, remains unclear, being he is a very private person in regard to business.\r\nI was of the opinion he would sell at the first available opportunity, but not so sure anymore.\r\nFor instance he certainly looked elated following the last win, high fiving all around him.\r\nHe has reintroduced the system of bringing in young prospects, not something a short term ownership would be interested in and in general appears to be enjoying the success of the club.\r\nThose signs plus the reported introduction of a business plan in regard to both a salary cap and an age limit on signings.\r\nWhy would an owner wanting to sell bother with any of those measures, seems more likely an indication of a projected long term relationship to me.\r\nBut i have been known to be wrong before !"
