  The problem I have with the view that we should be thankful to Ashley for
  'saving us' from administration, is that it's not true in the sense that he's
  done it for us. For all we know, it's just a by-product of protecting his own
  investment, because after everything he's said since Keegangate, that's what
  we've become. No longer the toy that he wanted to play with and the figure of
  fun he was looking for. We've become an investment to him now where he needs
  to recoup some of his losses. Because we all fell out and he's tried in vain
  to sell us on a number of occasions and that he hasn't come out with a
  statement of intent, we can just as easily assume the latter is true, rather
  than he's looking to keep us and make everything rosy again (not that it
  necessarily was in recent years). So yes, I'm grateful that he came along and
  may ultimately have indirectly saved our bacon but he might be waiting a while
  for a pat on the back.
