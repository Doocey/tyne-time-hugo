  To bowburning I honestly cannot disagree with any of your comment as the later
  is probably what he is doing, however protecting his investment and the
  stability of the club are intertwined. I guess I'm just extremely anxious
  about him selling the club with all the dodgy dealings going on in the world
  of football at the moment but even if he stays then I wouldn't give him a pat
  on the back just a stay of execution until I'm sure he is fully commited to
  the cause.
