message: "We can never ignore the turmoil the club have been subjected too over the last 2 years. But we had major major problems before Ashley took over with people taking more out of the club then they ever put in. \r\nYes we have had lies and mismanagement but after all of that we are still viable as a business.\r\nWeek after week the chant echo’s round the ground commenting on Ashley’s continued presence at the club. If we are realistic he is the club custodian, a rich man with an expensive toy. The continued abuse will only isolate him from the club which will be negative. Yes I am sure many people will disagree with me but it may be time to say you have made mistakes but repent and come back to the fold. NUFC are one of the greatest clubs in the world. The fan base is without doubt the most loyal and passionate (and I am proud to have supported the club for over 35 years). But we need someone who is prepared to support the club at a financial level which will deliver what the fan base deserve. No matter what your thoughts of Ashley are he has shown the potential to support the club to level that is required."
