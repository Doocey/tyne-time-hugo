message: "What a load of garbage. \r\n\r\nWe have never even been close to administration. The money from the transfer windows over the last two season have ensured that Ashley has made a nice healthy profit from NUFC.\r\n\r\nDid you know that some of the original land that Ashley acquired when purchasing NUFC has been sold for a pittance to one of Ashleys own satellite company's ? He will make a handsome profit on this land when redeveloped. He may be a fat cocknee bastard but he knows how to rip people off.\r\n\r\nGet real and stop scaremongering with silly articles like this one."
