  Lads, it's fair to say we still aren't on Mike Ashley side. Well I'm not
  anyway. The only thing I'm glad he has done is indeed avoid administration
  which would've been a real possibility. Yes of course he's protecting his
  asset but you'd certainly expect he would. Still though, administration
  wouldn't have been a <strong>total</strong> disaster for Mike Ashley as a
  business. He's eying up a Premier League return with big juicy TV revenue
  deals, as any businessman would.!
