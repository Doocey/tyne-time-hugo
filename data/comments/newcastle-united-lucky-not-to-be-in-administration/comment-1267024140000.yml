message: "Totally agree with the above sentiments, well posted guys :)\r\n\r\nAs for the current crop of players, I think they've done us a service with the way they've gone about their jobs to get us back into the PL at the first time of asking, the only problem we have is how much it's costing us to keep them, now I know Ashley has put in a wage cap of £15k per week in the Fizzy &amp; ruomurs are that will raise to £30k per week if/when we get back to the PL, I am just wondering if the so-called high earners like Smith, Nolan, Barton, Colo etc will be asked to drop their wages to that amount to stay with the club or be sold to make way for fresh talent on lower wages??\r\n\r\nIf the rumours are to be believed, all the above named have been courted by PL clubs this past season, so it wouldn't be hard to shift them out if we needed to freshen up &amp; lower the wage bill as well, so will Ashley do that or will he do his usual act &amp; put u up for sale again come the soummer, especially if promotion is guaranteed??"
