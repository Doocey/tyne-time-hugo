  If I was Mike Ashley,I would go onto the centre circle of the pitch at the
  next home game,take all the abuse and then admit I have made mistakes that has
  cost me Â£millions personally and apologuise.Then I would ask the fans to
  support me to take us back where we belong(Premiership)stating that we arenot
  going to bankrupt the club by paying stupid wages,no more greedy Owens who
  don`t care about the club and state we will be in a secure financial state to
  continue unlike most clubs.Then the last thing I would say is "I do care about
  the supporters,I do care about NUFC".
