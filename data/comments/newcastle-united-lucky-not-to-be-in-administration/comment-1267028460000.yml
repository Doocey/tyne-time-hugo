  At long last some well thought out, intelligent comments on M.A. I think he
  was naive when he took over and if he really wanted to develope young players
  and not buy established big money players, then he should never have hired K.K
  who doesn't have a clue about developing players as proved in his first stint
  as N.U.F.C manager. He then hired the fool Wise to try to stop K.K bankrupting
  the club and then asked Shearer to keep us up without any experience. All of
  this was to try to please us fans. This season however he has stopped his
  tactic of appeasement and started being a proper chairman by making the right
  decisions and backing C.H with good but inexspensive players. I agree that he
  should give a full public appology to the fans and I dont think he should sell
  in case we end up with Pompeys' Al Faraj. He should go back to his original
  strategy and devolpe quality youth players in our academy and look at making
  us great again in the long term as opposed to the short term blinkered view
  that Sheppard had. Also If Platini gets his way then we would be in a great
  possition if the top clubs have to sell players to get their wage bill under
  40% of their income. Finally Liverpool, Arsenal and Man.U, are in dire
  financial straights and are being kept afloat by loans and if Roman walked out
  on Chelski they would be F****D so i think we have a lot less to worry about
  than most of the biggest teams in Europe. That's my rant over any
  agreable/abusive responses welcome :)
