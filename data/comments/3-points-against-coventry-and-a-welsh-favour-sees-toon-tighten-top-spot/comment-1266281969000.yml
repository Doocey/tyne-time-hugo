message: "Forest fan here - wait - Newcastle have been a Premier League club for many many years &amp; have produced the odd hero for England too - Keegan, Shearer are recent ones. Your article is spot on (you can't say you're a small club or an average one either) &amp; I would expect a Newcastle blog site to say their team to win &amp; why not? At home, yes but Coventry are doing well but can they take points of you away? We'll see. \r\n\r\nAnyway, there's a long way to go still and plenty of points to be won &amp; lost. Who'll go up is anybodys guess but West Brom &amp; yourselves have advantage for now. A few weeks ago it wasn't like that at all. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is as we all know, the teams which havew the top 2 points go straight up. 3-6 play-offs &amp; they're NOT a lottery."
