message: "I have to say, reading these comments,  that I believe Newcastle United are looking over their shoulders - Cardiff to beat the Baggies - Jara out for the season - is this panic stations setting in at Toon Land?\r\n\r\nAlso - what is it about size? Does it matter really? Check the trophy cupboards of both WBA and NU and they have been bare for Years - that does make us any inferior on the day to almost 90% of the Football League and the Premier. Over time Albion have won the FA cup 5 times, the League Cup once and the League Title once - how does that compare with the mighty Magpies?\r\n\r\nHave a great season - enjoy second spot we are on the up!\r\n\r\nBoing Boing....."
