  well said yiannaki.common sense spoken.Every game I've gone to watch Newcastle
  I believe they've had a chance of winning whether it's been against Stevenage
  or Barcelona.If some want to call that arrogance that's fine,I call it
  supporting my team.We havn't won a domestic trophy since '55 but we still turn
  up every season,in hope(not expectation) of finally winning something.Does
  that make us deluded?doesn't every supporter of every club do the same?...roll
  on Wednesday...Howay the Lads.
