  Yiannaki, correct. 

  Forest are still in with a huge title shout don't you forget that, in fact any
  of the top 5 could still win this title. I'm hoping it'll be us for obvious
  reasons but any more performances like ours against Swansea away from home,
  could see us dropping points and inevitably, losing the title. The 1996
  scenario still lingers over NUFC just a little.
