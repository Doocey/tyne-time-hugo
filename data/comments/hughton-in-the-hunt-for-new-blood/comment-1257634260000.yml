message: "Not exactly a forthcoming statement, probably has as much of a clue as the rest of us.\r\nEither Ashley is serious about promotion and will open the purse strings, or he will gamble on doing it on the cheap, remains to be seen.\r\nBeing we are sitting atop the league  may generate a false sense of security, there`s a lot of games yet to play and a few key injuries leaves the club short of bodies.\r\nMy advice to MA is better to spend and ensure promotion, than risk another season in the second tier."
