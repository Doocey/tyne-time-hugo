  Typical pardew basher, ben arfa doesnt get in the team because he's ONLY
  interested in his "skills" as you put it. Should ben start to track back when
  he inevitably loses the ball and the other team break on us he might be
  playing. 


  As for marvaux, hes more of an assister than a finisher, but he goes invisible
  in those 50-50 games, gouf, however will be ever present in both attack and
  defence for a full 90, sure he has ineffective days but who doesn't? 


  Theres plenty of reasons to give pardew stick, hes hardly the perfect manager,
  but dont go looking for rubbish that isn't there just because you have a bee
  in your bonnet over something that probably happened last season.


  Great article mate, look forward to the Remy one.
