  the lad is good i give you that, he works his socks off. but while he covers
  that place, we will never see 6 goals in perhaps 10 games. that ben arfa is
  capable of   so i would argue that his replacement is far greater threat in
  front of goal, better to watch, and much better Technique and skills. i also
  think that marvuex has not been given a chance, and he has more skills, and it
  is the managers job, to get the best our of them, and he failed them. but
  still cant take his good performances away..
