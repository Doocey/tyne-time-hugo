  I like your style, Arthur.


  He does look like a prospect - could have potential to be a very successful
  manager, he's certainly working wonders down at Bournemouth anyway.


  However, it is a big step up, and recruiting him could land NUFC in a similar
  position to a side not too far up the road that did a similar job in
  appointing a lower-league manager.


  Saying that, I do think he would be an improvement on the current se√±or in
  charge - Howe has great potential.
