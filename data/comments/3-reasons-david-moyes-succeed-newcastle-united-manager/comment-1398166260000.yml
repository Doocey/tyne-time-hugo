  Whats the point on talking about possible replacements for Pardew when in
  reality it would not make any difference to the current squad of players let's
  be honest with ourselves until we rid ourselves of the main protagonist 
  Ashley, nothing will change, as the new manger would still have to toe the
  Ashley line.


  ASHLEY OUT!!!!!!!
