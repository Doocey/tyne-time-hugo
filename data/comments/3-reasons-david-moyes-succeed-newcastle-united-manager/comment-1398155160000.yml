  i too would have him in a flash, excellent choice to instill some metal and
  fight into what a consider a lazy, borderline sulking team. get them grafting
  i say. first get them busting a gut for one another, then the rest will
  follow. 

  far better choice than pullis or sherwood who have been linked. Or take it in
  another direction and go for Laudrup - the football swansea were playing
  before their european adventure was beatiful to watch, and if anything it led
  them to their first ever major trophy something newcastle could do with.
