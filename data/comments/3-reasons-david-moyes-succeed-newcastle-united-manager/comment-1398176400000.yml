  Hmmz I aint too sure about him, as at Everton he done ok but seemed to rely on
  playing for draws then he moved to man u an attacking team and failed, he
  would be a save manager to keep newcastle where they are now 10th-7th etc but
  to take us forward nah.

  Martinez took over everton and look at the difference now, they are a much
  better team under his management. ..which makes me wonder if moyes was doing
  any good in his time at everton
