  so just to confirm, IF we spend 20 million on two international, and have two
  already in the bag, you want another THREE. When pray tell would the academy
  products play then. Tiger wouldn't and they wouldn't develop and we would
  never have a local hero. If de jong and debuchy sign with good, I'd be happy
  if that was our business done.
