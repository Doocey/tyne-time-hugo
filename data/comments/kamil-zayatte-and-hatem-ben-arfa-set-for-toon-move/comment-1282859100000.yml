  I would take Zayatte, he is good back-up for virtually the whole backline and
  defensive midfield. Looked decent enough when i watched him at Hull, but think
  the own goals he scored may have tarnished what was in fact a reasonably
  successful personal first season. For 1.5million, yes please.
