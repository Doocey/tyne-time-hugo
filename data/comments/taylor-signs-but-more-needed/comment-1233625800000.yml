  Fair enough, but no-one can blame MA this transfer window, he has put some
  decent bids on the table, just been unfortunate to land more. My main concern
  now is our strikeforce, Martins better get back to fitness soon or we might be
  in a spot of bother. Just looking at our subs bench against Sunderland tells
  its own story.


  Krul, Xisco, Geremi, LuaLua, Donaldson, Edgar, Lovenkrands


  If your a goal down against a decent Premier League team, this bench and
  exactly going to provide much promise of getting back into the game.
