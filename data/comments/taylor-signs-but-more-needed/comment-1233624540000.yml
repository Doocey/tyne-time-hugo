  I could not see why Johnson would fail a medical, he has not been injured
  recently, and from what I've seen of him he is a capable youngster. I
  understand what Man City are saying though for Johnson, that they want to keep
  their youngsters. Had this been any other club, £8 million would secure the
  player, as the money would be invaluable who hasnt played since November. But
  this is Man City, the richest club in the world, so this money is not needed.


  With the three people we signed, Nolan is a class player, for £4 million he
  seems a steal. Taylor as well has been consistently good for Wigan, and how he
  got £6 million and him for "Le Sulk" I have no clue, thanks Steve Bruce.


  Denilson would be another great addition, he's played well for arsenal this
  season. Even if Arshevin signs, I can't see him going, however much I want him
  to, because Arsenal have got a whole host of injuries, in particular the
  midfield region, Walcott, Fabregas and Rosicky, so I heavily doubt he will be
  named as a Newcastle player.


  Well done Doocey for all your coverage over the transfer window, and I think I
  can say for everything who looks on here every day, thank you ever so much.
