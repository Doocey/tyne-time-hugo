  Conflicting info on Johnson.  Setanta reporting failed medical and Sky
  reporting bid denied.  I find it very hard that City wouldn't accept a bid of
  8 mil for a player that hasn't played since November.


  I am still very happy on the Nolan signing.  Future captain.  I don't consider
  Given leaving as a bad thing.  Harper is very capable of being our #1 and we
  got rid of the shit head Insomnia. 3 players in, 2 of them will give 110% all
  the time, can't complain.


  I am still seeing something about Denilson coming on loan if Arshaven
  completes his move.  Doocey have you heard anything?
