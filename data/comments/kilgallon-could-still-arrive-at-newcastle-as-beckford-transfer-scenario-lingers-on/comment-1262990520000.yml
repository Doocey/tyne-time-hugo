  Have to agree with jerry, long ball tactics, no creativity and even when we do
  get a chance of a break we play it backwards, allowing defenders to get in
  position and then have no option except cross from a long way out. granted
  jonas does on occasion get at defenders but his final delivery often leaves a
  lot to be desired. It is not the prettiest football to watch, but up to now is
  fairly effective, but I get this uneasy feeling our tactics ( or lack of
  them)have been rumbled and teams now deal with them a lot better. Hope I am
  wrong, but I think the second half of the season will be far more difficult
  than the first.
