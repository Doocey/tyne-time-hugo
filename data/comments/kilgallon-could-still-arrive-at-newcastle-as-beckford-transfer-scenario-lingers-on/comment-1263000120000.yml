  No Kilgallon and most probably no Becks. Without a good payment no good
  players will come to Toon.  Its not enough if a player wants to come and you
  do not back him by paying a decent sum for him. Most of the Leeds supporters
  feel that Becks is worth between 3 and 5 million, whilst another 25% of those
  voting said that he is priceless. Why start with an offer of a measly 1
  million if there is a real interest in the player? This is dragging too much
  and unless we pay, we get f**k
