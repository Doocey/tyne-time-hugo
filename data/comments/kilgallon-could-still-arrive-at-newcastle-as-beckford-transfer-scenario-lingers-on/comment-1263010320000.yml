  i think beckford will struggle at newcastle. you will soon see how bad his
  first touch and close control is. i think you would have been better off
  getting a proven championship striker rather than take a big gamble on a
  player who has, in alot of pessure games ie play offs ,last weekend aside gone
  totally missing.i think leeds will come off best if they 2 million for him.
  he,s not a team player
