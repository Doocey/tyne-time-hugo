message: "Kevin - I think we'll probably see Leon Cort on loan for the rest of the season - with the hope we could pick Kilgallon up for free in the summer. With Coloccini very rarely injured and Chris Hughton having the best injury record of any recent manager, through good old common sense, like not playing players when they are injured - we have to hope Coloccini and Steven Taylor remain injury free. And with young Tamas Kadar looking better with every game - an experienced back-up like Leon Cort, may be all we need for the rest of the season. \r\nLet's hope there's a draw tonight between WBA and Nottingham Forest - but since we are trying to put space between ourselves  and the 3rd placed side - a WBA win would be next best result."
