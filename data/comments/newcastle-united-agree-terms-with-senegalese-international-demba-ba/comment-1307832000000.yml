  So what if 1 month into the new season he gets injured and is out for several
  months or  worse? Will we be relying on Shola//Loven and Best? I hope we are
  after another first rate striker to mitigate that risk, and perhaps with a
  view to 442 at home against weaker opposition. Ideally top class, or worse
  case an up and coming circa 21yr old who looks like he can make it.  Playing
  Ben Arfa or another midfielder up front in that scenario is not ideal.
