message: "After watching Andy yesterday in the England - Portugal U21 game - he was almost unplayable in the air by Portugal, and he set up England's goal. I'm sure lots of managers liked what they saw.\r\nBut as far as the World Cup next year Peter Crouch is the player Fabio will go with - but this lad could become a great player for Newcastle - and to think I never even mentioned Nile Ranger."
