message: "I'm sure the extra experience he's gaining now will help him and us next season if we make it back into the prem. The back 3 of Taylor, Colo and Enrique are a must-keep for next season imo and Simpson as rb possibly.\r\n\r\nThe more the team can settle, have the same or similar team for the season has got to be a good thing for the future. Enrique and Jonas play well together on the left as Beye and (dare I mention) Geremi played well together on the right. \r\n\r\nAlso the experience Carroll nad Ranger are getting atm is invaluble, if we'd still been in the prem this season we probably woldn't have seen much of them atall in the first team."
