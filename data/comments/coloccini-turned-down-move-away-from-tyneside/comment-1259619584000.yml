  I never thought he was as bad as everyone made him out to be. His primary
  failing in the Premier League was his lack of speed, leaving him extremely
  vulnerable in 1-on-1 situations. With the slower pace of play in the
  Championship, he is having a much better go of it, but I have to think a
  transfer in the summer is in order, assuming we gain promotion, as he isn't
  going to get any faster.
