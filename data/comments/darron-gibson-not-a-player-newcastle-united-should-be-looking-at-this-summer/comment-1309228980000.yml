  As a Utd fan I have never rated Darron Gibson, but apart from Tiote and
  Barton, he's better than any midfield player Newcastle have got. He'd be a
  decent signing for you guys, he's been a bit unfortunate at Utd where he has
  been in a rather weak midfield since he broke into the team. He is a bit of a
  one trick pony though, stand on the edge of the area and bang it over the
  bar....
