message: "David Newcastle, I think your right about looking at the youngsters who are in the reserves for the likes of Liverpool etc, taking them for the future would be rather good deals for us. I also agree with your comments about looking towards the yuongsters in Scotland, and the tp players there, However I don't think McGeady etc would join us, infact as soon as word came out that we made a bid for him, a Premiership club would steal him away from Celtic first. I do think Zander Diamond from Aberdeen would be worth looking at.\r\n\r\nI still hope we can get Simpson though."
