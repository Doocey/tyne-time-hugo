message: "Ask any Leeds fan - Beckford has a first touch that is appalling but makes up for this at league one level with blistering speed off the mark. At 26 the first thing to go will be this ability to burst from a standing start, so to bid more than Â£1.5 million for this type of player does'nt make long term sense.\r\nEqually if Danny Simpson's agent reckons he can get the sort of wages that Man Utd have had him on nowadays he is living in cloud cuckoo land - especially if you consider what he would be offered by man utd now that they are in serious financial difficulties. People slag off Ashley but being careful with what he leaves any new buyers makes complete sense, and the present squad is so settled and together if we have to go with what we've got and hope against many injuries then so be it."
