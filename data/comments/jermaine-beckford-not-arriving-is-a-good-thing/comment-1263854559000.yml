  As a Leeds fan i am glad to see Becks remaining at Elland road till the end of
  the season, ok people say he's disrespectful to the club ect however we dont
  look like scoring without him. I think he would cut it in the championship and
  maybe help Newcastle to promotion however his pace would not be so dangerous
  in the premier and he would not get the chances he does. I think he would of
  been a good signing because as an impact player in the premier he would no
  doubt be dangerous. Beckford 2 mill out Going up 10 mill+, we are Leeds!
