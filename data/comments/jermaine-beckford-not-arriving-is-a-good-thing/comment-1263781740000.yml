message: "In fairness, not defending DikieBoy, but a deal between £1.5m and £2m is actually quite substantial.\r\nNot in the Premier League but 500k is often a transfer on it's own.\r\n\r\nFor Newcastle though, it really shouldn't mean too much, but whether it's been the difference between us signing anyone and not, I really don't know."
