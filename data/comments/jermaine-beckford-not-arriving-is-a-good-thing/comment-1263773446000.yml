message: "I know all football supporters tend to be the same, i.e A player is captured from another club against their wishes = coup. A player turns down the chance to move to their club = he's crap/wouldn't have cut the mustard/glad he never came, I never rated him, type attitude. However all the reports/comments I saw coming out from you Geordies was at a £1.5/£2m punt he was worth it!!! Suddenly your relieved he hasn't come! LOL\r\nDon't get me wrong it baffled me why you wanted him in the first place bearing in mind your position in the CCC. However delving deeper I can see it was an act of desperation by CH in trying to keep your season on track. You could be in for a sticky time of it in the 2nd half of the campaign! To hope a player that you already had on loan will come back to spearhead the attack is the act of a club decidedly on a wobble. Our two clubs mirror each other a division apart-failure to move up would be disaterous for either. I have doubts myself that Beckford could do the business at CCC level consistently, (he's shown he can have a nose for goal on the big stage-but has only managed it the once), but at L1 level he can hack it. Half a season in CCC, well it might've been the difference in getting you up, before defences found him out. \r\nSounds as if both clubs supporters have got what they want out of the Beckford situation then eh?\r\nBest of luck to you as the PL needs big clubs back in there before it becomes a joke of a league with only 5 or 7 teams with history/fanbase in there!"
