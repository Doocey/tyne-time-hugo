  I agree with this article, he wouldnt cut it in the PL. As a Leeds fan, his
  laziness, fits of arogance and mood swings do my head in...but I forget all
  about that when he bangs them in! He has a fantastic record and can never be
  written off no matter how poor a game he seems to be having. He is ACE!!!
