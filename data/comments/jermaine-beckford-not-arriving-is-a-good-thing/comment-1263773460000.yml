  I'm glad jermaine Is staying with us, if he was maybe 22-23 you guys could of
  taken a punt on him, but I don't think he could cut it in the prem, i see him
  week in week out, he'll maybe have 12 chances and score maybe 1, we played
  tranmere n won 4-0, beckford himself hit the wood work 6 times, in the prem
  you don't get that many chances, good luck to you guys, I hope us an u are in
  the prem sooner rather than later, n we Leave boro behind!! MOT
