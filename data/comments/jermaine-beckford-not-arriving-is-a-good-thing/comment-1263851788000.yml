  good luck to newcastle a club like yours should be in englands top flight
  however i dont believe all you geordies who are suddenly saying that there
  glad beckford isnt coming to be honest your quite amazed that he wants to stay
  at leedsand i,m glad ken bates is in charge cause no other club gets our
  players for free anymore well done ken for sticking with it
