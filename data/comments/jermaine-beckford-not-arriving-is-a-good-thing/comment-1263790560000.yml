message: "Calling all clubs with 'transfer rebels'.\r\nHaving trouble with a player wanting to leave ?\r\nThe answer?\r\nInform him Newcatsle United are willing to enrole in transfer talks.\r\nResult= The player will take him self off the transfer list and continue to play for your club.\r\n\r\nSee, Kilgallon &amp; Beckford.\r\n\r\nTomorrow hopefully will not show the cracks that have appeared over the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nCome on the Toon, i feel tomorrows game could be win or bust. (yeah sounds dramatic, but the WBA result could be the start of something very good or something very bad)"
