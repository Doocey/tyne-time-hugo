  newcastle are now gunna be linked with all the players we were linked with if
  beckford left and to be fair some of those are better than beckford  more
  rounded players .to be fair to beckford he is staying also fair play to leeds
  who pretty much said he would.and of course newky fans didnt want him and
  leeds fans never when  he put in a transfer wanted him either  LOL well we are
  all happy now .personally i think he will do a job for us in league 1 and in
  championship if we get promoted and he stays i will bet newcastle wont sign
  him if they get promoted but WOLVES MIGHT IF THEY GET RELEGATED i have seen
  95-6% of his games and he is not a premier league player but we have at least
  3 years before that happens say what you will about big and small clubs leeds
  are 1 of the 15 or so big clubs newcastle been 1 too so we will be if we get
  promoted to coki champs  1 of the bigger clubs outside prem league so he at
  that point will be better of staying .my feeling is beckford will sign a new
  contract 3 years at leeds if we get promoted  GOOD LOOK TO NEWCASTLE
