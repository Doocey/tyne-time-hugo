message: "I have said before that he wasn't worth £1m never mind between £2.5m-£3m, and I'm glad it looks like we are not getting him. I said before at the end of the day he is a League 1 striker who at 26 is in his prime years, and he isn't even the top scorer in League 1 and is well know to not play well in the big games, aside from Man Utd earlier this month.\r\n\r\nBut to be honest I can see this as being a ploy to get more money out of Newcastle, I still think if we made a bid for £2m then Leeds would sell, I just hope we don't make anymore bids for him."
