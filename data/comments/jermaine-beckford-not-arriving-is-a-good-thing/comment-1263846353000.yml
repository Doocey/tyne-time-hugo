  Dave, Leeds is spot on. Beckford has great pace, which is all you need in
  League One. Honestly, I'm not even sure he would score many in the
  Championship, never mind the Premiership should you get promoted. That goal
  against our friends from across the Pennines epitomised the guy. A complete
  mis-control accounted for by sheer pace. Now that may get you the odd goal,
  but not the kind of return a newly-promoted club will need in the Prem. Here's
  to our teams playing each other soon, in the right bloody division!!
