  I, myself would sooner see Marlon back than have an unproven striker in
  Beckford a lot of Leeds fans I've spoken to don't have a good thing to say
  about him but good luck to Leeds I hope they do get promoted as they don't
  deserve to be where they are. I would love to see young Simpson signed on a
  permenant deal and a couple of loanees but here's hoping !!
