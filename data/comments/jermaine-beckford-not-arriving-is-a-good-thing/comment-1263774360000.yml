message: "He fluffed your header chance at Exeter - should have been on target. I saw him in both games against Kettering. Leeds collectively, and him individually, didn't look very good.\r\n\r\nAgainst Man U he scored a goal. But the reason Leeds got through was down to your midfield and defence. He didn't shine."
