message: "I won't believe any of this about Beckford &amp; Kilgallon until they're out on the hallowed turf at SJP in B&amp;W shirts with Hughton, then we'll know what's true &amp; what isn't!!!\r\nForget the 31yr old left sider, it's just crap-loid rubbish, why would we need another left sided player when we have Jonas, is it to keep his bench seat warm for him just incase he hasto come off the pitch, complete waste of writting space:( Btw Doocey, good site mate :)"
