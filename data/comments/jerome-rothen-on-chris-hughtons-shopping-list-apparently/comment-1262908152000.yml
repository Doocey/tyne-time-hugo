message: "You will never win anything with kids....\r\nRothen was fantastic against us in the cup a few years back and has failed to live up to his potential. But a steady Scott Sellars style player would always be a welcome addition. Someone who can take a corner would be a bonus! I think you will also find that with the removal of Butt we also have a pretty young squad. You need experience to help these kids along. Also what is wrong with getting players who will accept short contracts whom we can part ways with without paying huge fees for?"
