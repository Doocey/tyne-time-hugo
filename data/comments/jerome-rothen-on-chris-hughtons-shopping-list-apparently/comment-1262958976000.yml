message: "Whilst were at it i used to post as kevin nichol on Ed's bolg :-)....\r\n\r\nIf we can bring rothen in as cover for jonas then why not bring him in on loan until the end of the season! Injuries and suspensions will come into play at some stage and we do not have another player who can go out wide left to my knowledge. An experienced French international cannot but help our cause and no.1 goal in getting promoted back to the PL. \r\n\r\nThe more options we have the better!!!\r\n\r\nReally hoping the journal or the chronicle pull their finger out today and give us some real news on Beckford!"
