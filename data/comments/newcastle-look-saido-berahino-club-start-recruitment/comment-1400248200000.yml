  no objections here in signing up a 20 year english kid who's already playing
  prem football, but very clearly we would need at least another striker of top
  qaulity who's at the required level already. remy is needed too, not that ive
  ever seen much of him mind you. and dont let the signings stop there - but is
  it just me or does anyone else predict the usual dragging of the feet from
  newcastle here, where we'd be lucky to get any of our top targets. please
  prove me wrong...
