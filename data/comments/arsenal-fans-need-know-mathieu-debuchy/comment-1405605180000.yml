  not that bothered by his departure to be honest. yes had a fine spell last
  season, but stood out a bit more than perhaps he should have simply by the
  awful performances all around him. can be a bit weak on the ball for me,
  despite the tatts, i think he can be easily knocked about. crossing isnt the
  best either. overall happy to almost double our money on this guy and get a
  younger replacement, perhaps with more potential. 

  good luck though mats, thanks for briefy stoppping by....
