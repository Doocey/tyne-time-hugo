message: "It appears Carroll is playing tonight, also from a lot of accounts Taylor went too far winding the lad up. \r\n\r\nDon't jump to conclusions. \r\n\r\nInteresting all the papers jumping on this. The Sun saying a black day for Newcastle, talking about dyer and bowyer, something that happened 4 years ago with players we've sold. No mention of the fight ON SATURDAY between two Spurs players on the field or Bullard and Barmby. \r\n\r\nOnce again the southern press trying to undermine any success we have, and our fans prove to be fickle and judgemental. Let the truth come out first before biting."
