message: "Carroll has arguably been the biggest benefactor of our relegation, what with the opportunity that gave him to break into the first team.  I assume that this has led to him mistakenly believing that, because he’s scored a couple of goals, he must therefore be invincible.  He obviously lacks the brains to recognise that he has been extremely lucky to get the opportunities and exposure he has had of late – some are even talking about him being looked at by Capello and given the NUFC No.9 shirt!  But believe me, he’s no Alan Shearer – far from it, in fact.  He has done OK in the Championship, but he has got a long, long way to go before he can be considered to be a proven, Premiership standard striker.  He has (or should I say “had”?) a chance to establish himself as a decent player, but his lack of a brain and disgraceful attitude can only result in career suicide.  He’s only 21, and yet he’s already been cautioned by police for assaulting a woman about 18 months ago,  he’s about to stand trial for glassing someone in the Bigg Market, and there was the training ground fight with N’Zogbia.  And now he’s broken Taylor’s jaw whilst already on bail for the other assault.  He really needs to hope that Taylor doesn’t make a complaint to the Police, because the Crown Court certainly won’t be impressed with him committing another offence whilst already on bail, and serious consequences could follow i.e. imprisonment.  I appreciate that we don’t know ALL of the facts, but there is no excuse for punching a team mate no matter how much winding up went on, plus he has too much previous for something like this to just be casually overlooked.  \r\n\r\nI really hope that this is dealt with properly by the club, and I endorse Doocey’s suggestion that he should be suspended until the end of the season and then shown the door.  I’d also like to see him forfeit his wages for the duration of that suspension, and pay Taylor’s wages for the extra time he will spend out injured, and pay a fine to the club to compensate for being unable to field Taylor for the extra time spent injured (and perhaps Taylor needs to be fined too, depending upon exactly what has gone on).  I think this might help Carroll to learn about the consequences that flow from his moronic actions."
