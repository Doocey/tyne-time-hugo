message: "Utter Tosh.\r\n\r\nYou have no idea what has happened between these two guys or how the injury was inflicted. \r\n\r\nHow do you know that Carroll was in the wrong and not Taylor or for that matter how do you even have the clarity that the injury resulted from a blow by Andy. The training pitch and the dressing room are rough environments and things can get out of control or be taken out of context. \r\n\r\nOpinions and Arseholes - everybodys got one but some people like to show theirs off without thinking. \r\n\r\nJust let the grown ups resolve this one. If the lads guilty then I'm sure there will be appropriate action but the last thing we need right now is Harry the Hysteric and His Lynch Mob."
