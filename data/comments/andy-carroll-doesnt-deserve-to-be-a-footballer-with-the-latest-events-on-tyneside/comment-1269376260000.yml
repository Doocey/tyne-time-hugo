message: "Carroll is a daft lad, but don't think for one minute that he'll leave the club. There are a lot of clubs looking to buy Carroll and if we release him, he'll have plenty of clubs to choose from. Barton is no saint, but we bought him and his history is far worse than Carroll's.\r\nGet a grip, he'll be fined and we need him to play to push us on to promotion. I don't like what he's alleged to have done, but we need him more than he needs us."
