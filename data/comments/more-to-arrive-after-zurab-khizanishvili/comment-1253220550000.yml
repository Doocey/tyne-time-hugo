  We've a long road in front us for sure but with new signings like Zurab and
  gritty performances like at Cardiff then there's every chance we could be in
  the play-off positions come May.

  But we need more players and I've been emphasizing that we need 6 more, for
  weeks now.

  Even Kevin Nolan said we need half a dozen of new faces.

  Saying that, we know that there isn't much money there for Chris to spend.
