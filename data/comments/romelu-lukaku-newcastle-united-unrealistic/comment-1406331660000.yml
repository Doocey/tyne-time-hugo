  I think you need to give your head a wobble son! Yeah Newcastle as it stands
  aren't a stand out team any more but do you think Everton are? Yeah they had a
  good season but so did we a couple ago, the reality is neither team has the
  depth in the squad to really challenge at the top especially with the added
  pressure of European football! Let's be real kid no one talk about Everton as
  much as you'd like to think/make out they do! And just because you've been
  slagging us off I'm gonna drop another dose of reality, were the biggest team
  in our region (north east just in case you're a tad dim) where as you son
  follow a team that are 4th best in their region, they've never been the best
  and never will be! 


  Take care Saj lad
