  Fair one. Apologies for the idiot comment. Uncalled for. You've got valid
  points there. My main gripe tho was the deluded comment which am I right in
  saying, you think some fans, not all are deluded. I would like to ask in what
  way are they deluded. Can I assume that you have spoke to fans to which you
  think are deluded? Am a NUFC supporter, i have friends who are supporters and
  have met people who are supporters. I can't remember speaking to anyone and
  thinking this person is deluded and expects too much. I think am being
  realistic when I say that Nufc are at best a mid table team who's in badly
  need of a striker/CB at the mo. After the way we played at the back end of
  last season, to finish in the top ten would be a bonus and exceed my own
  expectations for the firth forth coming season. Your right in saying 50 k plus
  crowds don't make you a big club but since NUFC is the only major supported
  team in the city of Newcastle with no rival teams to compete against in terms
  of fans or finically e.g Liverpool/Everton, Manchester Utd/ Man City or the
  likes of the London based teams. This alone will put more pressure on the club
  to do well. NUFC fans arnt expecting to win the league or challenge for it or
  get in the CL spots anytime soon. That will not change unless you get lucky
  like Man City with the owners they have now. So when other fans make the
  deluded comments,  I fail to see on what facts they base that on.
