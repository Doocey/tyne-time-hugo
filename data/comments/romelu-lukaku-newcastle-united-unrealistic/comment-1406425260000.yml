  You have a bigger/nicer stadium and more fans come to watch you. That's kind
  of it in terms of competing with everton for the foreseeable future. You have
  a few good players but I what makes everton good is that our squad has been
  built slowly and we play as a team (with heart and determination). Your
  players looked like they couldn't be arsed from Feb onwards last season. Also
  I get the feeling that Pards just tries to gee the players up before the game
  and tactics don't play a big part in his management style. Nothing against you
  supporters but he comes across as such an idiot when interviewed post-match.
  Whereas with Martinez you can see the intelligence and will to win in his
  eyes. As for lukaku, we'll just have to wait and see. Could be everton, could
  be Wolfsburg, could stay at chelsea. Or newcastle could nip in behind behind
  everyone's back because Rom suddenly decides he wants to play hoof ball for
  the toon!
