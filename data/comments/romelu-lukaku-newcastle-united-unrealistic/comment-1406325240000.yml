  My point about Lukaku is 
  why would we bring him while we have Rivi ? 
  I'd rather wait until January and go for Danny Ings
  for all thoses Everton clowns , no one is asking for your
  pathetic  meaningless opinion , Just bunch of idiots , so angry &amp; hateful 
  people because we are making some good signings 
  our club is in the right direction to reach the CL 
  especially after this summer and all those WC players and probably
  there is more on the way .


  so all what you need to do THEFRTON fans is knock your head in a wall
  no one would care .
