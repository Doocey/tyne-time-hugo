  The short answer to your title, is yes. Seemingly gone are the Freddie Shepard
  days and you lot won't spend that much on a player anymore.  Shame what's
  happened up there really, Joe Kinnear, need I say more. Cracking scouting
  system though, Debuchy, Cabaye and Sissoko, impressive that.

  To weigh in on this dick measuring contest that seems to be happening.
  Newcastle and Liverpool are roughly the same size in population I should
  think, one is a one club city, the other is a two club city, strangely you
  seem to think that a 52,000 seater stadium makes you big, my apologies but it
  doesn't, every other way to gage who is the bigger club, Everton have you beat
  really, not intentionally being antagonistic, but have always had a bit of a
  chip on my shoulder after Pardew and his different league remark.
