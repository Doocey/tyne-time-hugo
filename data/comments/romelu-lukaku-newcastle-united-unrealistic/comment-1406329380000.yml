  Hahaha. Of course you will but there's a better chance of hell freezing over
  first. You guys are gonna either get relegated or finish 17th. You don't have
  one stand out player. You haven't signed a player who will improve your team
  and you haven't shown any signs of winning anything. Whereas we have. In
  Roberto we trust! Like he says 'we play with arrogance.' Tottenham, 
  Southampton, Stoke, West Ham,  crystal palace, Sunderland are all better than
  you guys plus the top teams. Bring back gazza I'm sure he's better than
  shola!!
