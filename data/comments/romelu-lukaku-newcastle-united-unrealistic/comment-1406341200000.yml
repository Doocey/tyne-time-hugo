  Just to let you know ste Liverpool population 466k newcastle 280k , we really
  aren't a very big place at all, that makes your town 2/3rds bigger .... 50k
  gates from a population of 280k is not too bad......particularly given our
  absolute lack of any type of success ,  you have to go back to the fifties .(
  domestically at least) .... Which really is ridiculous, regardless of the
  success or otherwise we keep turning out.......not everyone else can say
  that.....in our eyes that's the measure of our club.
