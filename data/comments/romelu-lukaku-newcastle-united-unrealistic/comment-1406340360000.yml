  Saying your the biggest team in your region is like saying your the most
  tolerant member of UKIP. It doesn't mean a lot when your main rivals for this
  prestigious title (best in the region) are sunderland and hull. Come on kid.
  You'd kill for Martinez as manager instead of that clown Pards. Also you'd
  kill for players of the quality of baines mccarthy stones barkley and
  mirallas. Yes you got the 5th place trophy 2 seasons ago but all the other
  seasons of the past 8 years you've been utter sh1t (unless you count winning
  the championship which I don't because everton fans haven't known what it is
  like to play in that league for about 60 years). As for getting Lukaku, you
  are absolutely deluded.
