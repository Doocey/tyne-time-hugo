  I do think some Newcstle fans are deluded, but I think all teams have deluded
  fans 


  I do think the expectations in the average Newcastle fan has massively changed
  over the last few years and the same expectation of success just isn't there
  with most fans I know, I still know and work with newcastle fans who think
  they have a Devine right to success and are habitually optimistic regardless
  of results and the competitiveness of the league, but as I said before, I'm
  sure if I moved to a different city I would encounter similar beliefs so again
  I don't think currently that newcastle fans in general are deluded, and I'm
  sure plenty of fans have spoken to me and have thought I was deluded when I
  said we would do well under Roberto Martinez last summer.


  I do think given your current chairmen and last seasons ending, it is
  unrealistic that you will sign Lukaku but being hopeful
