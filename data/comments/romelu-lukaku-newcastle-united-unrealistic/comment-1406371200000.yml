  When was the last time you were even close to competing for those titles then?
  Before the 1990's that's for sure. We are both teams that are of equal footing
  in the league. Before you start blabbering on saying you finished above us
  last year, big whoop, overall since the premiership began we are both in the
  top 10 with similar points.
