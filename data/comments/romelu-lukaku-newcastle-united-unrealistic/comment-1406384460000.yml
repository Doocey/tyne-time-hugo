  Have been watching Newcastle games in New Zealand and its as plain as day that
  we need a first class striker a top notch centre half and a class play maker
  if we don't get them then even with the good players we have got  in this
  window we will struggle to make the top ten the money is there so go out and
  get the players we need get into the champions league and you get your money
  back with interest
