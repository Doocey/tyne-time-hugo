  It doesn't matter about competition for support in the region  it's about
  being the top team in that region. Everton are unlucky enough to have
  Liverpool City an Manu in the nearby vicinity an they are gonna struggle
  capturing a new fan base outside of family loyalty. It's a big problem and it
  stunts their growth and had done for years. nufc havn't got. Explain again why
  that is a plus for Everton?
