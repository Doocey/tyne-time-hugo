  Firstly I live in newcastle and have done for 15 years and I know enough toon
  fans to know they all don't share the same views which leads me into....


  Secondly I never said the comment you have attached to me, putting quote marks
  doesn't mean I actually said it, I never said newcastle fans were deluded,
  some are though, as with every club including my own


  Thirdly  I said you wouldn't sign Lukaku mainly cos ashley wouldn't stump up
  the cash to pay his wages to make up for the lack of European football which
  you agree with so not really sure what you ve achieved with your rant which
  basically agrees with me 


  Fourthly nowhere in my comments anywhere have I said Lukaku wouldn't entertain
  signing fir newcastle, 


  Feel free to call me an idiot, it's the internet after all but at least get
  the basics right on why you're calling me an idiot
