  So you think just because a manager claims his team are going to push for a CL
  place means players will believe him and sign on the dotted line? My word you
  are deluded? It was only a couple of months back Newcastle fans were
  protesting about the way the club was being run.


  We all love our clubs,but even Newcastle fans have got to admit that Everton
  are a more attractive proposition for Lukaku. The only thing in Newcastles
  favour is the ground and your turn out. I don't believe footballers give two
  shits about either.


  If Newcastle's such a great club,why do you keep losing your best players?
