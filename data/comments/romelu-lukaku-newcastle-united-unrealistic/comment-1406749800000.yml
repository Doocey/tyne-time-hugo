  I'm not sure we're of equal footing tbh. You're not what you were in the 90s
  and have been relegated very recently. Your home attendances are superb, but
  you have a lesser honours list (you can't really dismiss history in a
  discussion of the integrity of football clubs) and are much weaker than us in
  footballing terms at this current time. 



  On that note: WELCOME, Mr Romelu Lukaku. 5 year contract, happy days.
