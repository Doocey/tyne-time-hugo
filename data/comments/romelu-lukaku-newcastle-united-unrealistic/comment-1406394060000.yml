  I never once said we could land him?? So you telling me the likes of jaanmat,
  de Jong, tiote, sissoko, krul, cabella wouldn't be welcome in the Everton
  squad? Where would you have finished had it not been for the loan signings in
  delofeu and lukaku? As can be said with us without remy I didn't come into a
  Newcastle vs Everton row on who's better by however much, I'm a realist and as
  it stands neither team is a stand out one and neither team has the depth for
  an added competition! Yeah for newcastles history I agree we've not been up to
  scratch of recent years but that's not to say Everton haven't been mediocre..
  What I'm saying is were not as different as you may like to think..
