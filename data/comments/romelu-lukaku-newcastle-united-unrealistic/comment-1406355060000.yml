  Haha, gove it a rest. got to say, I find it hilarious that you all insist on
  arguin over the big club small club debate. With newcastle and Everton the
  truth is it's difficult to say, there are arguments for both. 


  It all depends on what determines your own idea of a big club (and let's be
  honest, which side of the fence your on.)

  Is it current gates, size of stadia, annual turnover, quality of playing
  staff, past or present, pre or post prem era. 


  Taking into account all of the above listed criteria and looking solely at the
  prem era NUFC have had a higher average finish, bigger gates, mich higher
  anual turnover more cup final/semi final appearances, more European football
  particularly champions league. Everton have had some good teams over the years
  and were a bigger club once. But since the money came in just after the great
  Liverpool teams of the 80's and early 90s they struggled to get a foot hold
  initially. NUFC hit the ground running and became a bigger brand. We had
  perhaps THE team of the 90's with king Kevs class of 97 that helped to shape
  the brand that is today's premier league. The big blot on the copybook is our
  relegation. It's hard to ignore it and the period before relegation was a
  transition in the way the club operated it was always gonna get worse before
  it got better. Everton over that same period have been managed well and
  gradually brought to the boil but Nufc were in the top 10 in Europe for annual
  turnover and I feel change in the wind. We shall see......


  Nufc today is a big club, as is Everton make your own mind up but don't try
  and change mine. Taking into account the above reasoning NUFC! ALL DAY LONG!
  This is my opinion and I'm sure you'll have yours. Try to remember though
  that's all it is so try not to sound like your stating a fact. Haha


  PEACE!!
