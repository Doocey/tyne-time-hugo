  O shut up. Another idiot that comes out with the 'NUFC fans are deluded
  comment'. You clearly being an outsider seem to share the same ignorant views
  like a lot of other know it all fans from different parts of the country. You
  call us deluded when really it's more blind faith. Nufc fans turn up week in
  week out in support of a club and team team that's never won a trophy in over
  50 years. Its not being deluded to have ambition. That's what it's all about.
  As fans wanting your club to show ambition to strive to compete at the top end
  of the PL table. Why as fans should we settle for less. No club has a divine
  right too trophies but you have to show ambition to try and compete, otherwise
  what's the point in supporting a club. NUFC fans are not blind to reality as
  you seem to think. We know that the chances of signing a player are like
  Lukaku are slim to none, mainly because we have a chairman who  we will not
  spend the type of money needed to get him. However if Ashley did for once show
  real ambition and go after Lakaku, don't act like Lakaku wouldn't even
  entertain the thought of joining us. He wants CL football, which Nufc or
  Everton can't provide but both teams can offer him the chance to be the number
  1 striker at both clubs. Something he wouldn't be at Chelsea by the looks of
  their recent signings. At this point in his career, playing week in week out
  should be his only real ambition.
