  Yes but I'd be interested to see how many people live within 50 miles of
  newcastle, 


  Sunderland and Gateshead and maybe Middlesbrough are the only competition for
  fan base up here, however in the north west you have everton, Liverpool, man
  city, man United, Stockport, bury, Blackburn, Wigan, accrington, Blackpool,
  Rochdale, fleetwood town and I'm sure a few more but I can't think of any of
  the top of my head


  Certain newcastle fans are massively loyal don't get me wrong, however as
  someone who lives here and knows countless newcastle 'fans' it is plain wrong
  for newcastle fans to act like they are the most loyal in the country and this
  makes them a big club, it's just wrong wrong wrong and it's the main reason
  why I can't take newcastle fans seriously, plenty of newcastle fans understand
  this but they don't shout the loudest so the rest of country just laugh. 


  Ironically everton only failed to sell out one away game all last season,
  newcastle away! I know for a fact that's not the case with newcastle and I
  thinks a far fairer way to compare support as home support is dependent on so
  many different factors such as price, obstructed views etc... Away tickets are
  the same
