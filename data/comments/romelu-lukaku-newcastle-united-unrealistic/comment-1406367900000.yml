  I'm not sure you understand that my comment was in direct relation to one from
  blackandwhite9, 


  I never said it was a plus for everton at all.


  I just mean that comparing purely the sizes of the cities is irrelevant given
  the catchment areas/regions which is far more relevant a figure to use when
  talking about attendances 


  I'll be interested to see the average attendances this season at nufc as I
  know plenty of season tickets holders who have had enough, if the new signings
  don't pan out, I can see some real unrest at the Ashley and pardew partnership
  and the gates dropping a fair bit
