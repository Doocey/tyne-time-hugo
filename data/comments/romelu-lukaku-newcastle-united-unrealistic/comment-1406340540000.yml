  I'm a massive Toon fan but I got to agree with Pablo. Right now Everton are a
  better proposition. We are always a game away from meltdown. Everton have had
  a solid decade, with respectable finishes. Since Bobby left we've had one top
  6 finish, and one relegation. We are a big English club with a terrific
  stadium. But we also have a great tendency to shoot ourselves in the foot. 

  And between Pardew and Martinez there is no comparison. Pardew is negative and
  Martinez is positive. 

  Right now we are a club with great potential, but before we start convincing
  big players/stars we need to back it up with consistent top 6 finishes over a
  3-5 year period.
