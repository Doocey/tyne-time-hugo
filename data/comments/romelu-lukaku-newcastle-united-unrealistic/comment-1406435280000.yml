  Not sure I get what you mean about everton fans not going to see conference
  teams, what's the relevance to the debate?


  I'm not gonna get into a debate about passion with fans as every team will
  think their fans the most passionate 


  I will question your point about ambition tho, purely because your
  chairman/board isn't that ambitious and at the end of the day that's the only
  ambition that matters when signing players surely? 


  Ignoring Lukakus connection to efc and European football, and the fact everton
  finished 5th with a points total that 9 times out of 10 would be enough for
  champions league, Do you seriously think ashley would stump up the transfer
  fee and wages to attract Lukaku? Because at the end of the day that's the only
  thing that's relevant in this debate about whether it's realistic?
