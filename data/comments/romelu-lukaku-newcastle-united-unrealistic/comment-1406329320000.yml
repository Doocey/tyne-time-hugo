  Lukaku wants champions league football, everton don't have that which is why
  Lukaku hasn't signed yet, however everton have a manager and a squad that
  Lukaku knows and respects and europa league football to play for, that's why
  newcastle are 16/1 to sign him and everton 1/5 


  Another point is with regards to your money assumption, you have
  Debuschy/cabaye money apparently to spend even though you have bought 5/6
  players in and have a chairman, who according to my toon mates doesn't want to
  spend money as he is only after profit, 


  Everton have a chairmen who although not popular is all about the team and
  will have money from fellaini, anichebe and jelavic deals


  The bottom line is if everton don't sign Lukaku it won't be because we can't
  afford transfer fee, it will be because he wants to play at a higher level
  which is why everton fans laugh when you ask if newcastle are realistically
  gonna sign him, as if you re being honest you know full well ashley won't
  offer the wages Lukaku would want to sign for a team like newcastle
