  Going on about teams in the vicinity area like Stockport etc we have blyth
  Spartans ,gateshead,Dunston UTS,whitley bay all if these sides when Newcastle
  aren't playing still get support from the toon and out of a population of 280k
  that's not a bad following whereas I can't see Everton fans going to watch
  your local conference teams. It doesn't matter who is the bigger club he would
  sign for the team with more ambition and the more passionate fanbase which I
  believe in my opinion to be NUFC...its not about family loyalty up here its
  just in your blood to support them...not because your dad,uncle or whatever is
  a bluenose....occasionally a few slip through the net but other than that we
  are one of the best supported teams in the prem and the most loyal
