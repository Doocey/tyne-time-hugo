  Much as I understand the fans dislike of Mike Ashley and his mismanagement of
  the club, the source of the club's problems lie with the previous regime.
  Freddie Shepherd may have backed his managers with the funds for big name
  signings, but the money was not his, it came from increasing the club's debts
  and spending years of sponsorship money in advance.  He also indulged in
  business deals which were advantageous to associates of himself and costly to
  the club.  He then made a substantial profit from the sale of NUFC to Mike
  Ashley.  Even in the most optimistic scenario, Mike Ashley is going to lose
  tens of millions on his investment in NUFC.
