message: "I don't like MA, his lack of resolute action last term was the main reason we were relegated.  However, the incentive to re-shape the unsustainable high spending ethos of the club (a legacy from the FS trophy signing days and before) would not have been there if we had missed the drop.  \r\n\r\nWithout MA's rescue of this club, the NUST group could only dream.  They could not have bought the club off FS as it was riddled with black holes of hidden debt, debt that MA has had to take on the chins.  To his credit, he has, and we were sailing very (very) close to administration but for his private fortune.  NUST could not have done this, and the club would have collapsed very quickly.\r\n\r\nWhatever the future of the club is, and whatever the faults of Ashley are, time will show that he alone proved to be the lucky soft financial landing that our disastrously out of control club somehow managed.  He is millions out of pocket on this, several tens of millions to be precise, money that all the toon faithful put together could not have afforded to stump up.  He could have walked away, he didn't, and as a result we are seriously daring to look again at the Premiership instead of floundering at the bottom of the Championship with a 10 point deduction and half the current remaining squad sold off.  Fair's fair here, MA has the guts admit he made huge mistakes last year, but he has also the bollox to put his hand in his pocket to put them right.  \r\n\r\nI'll never the like the guy, but I'm learning to respect his methods a little more.  Those still hell bent on his destruction need to read a few spreadsheets and look at the yearly statements.  We have had far, far worse owners than Ashley, but nobody ever said a word.   Possibly because they weren't cockneys?"
