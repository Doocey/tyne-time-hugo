  Aw, leave the man alone. I mean....we're top of the league so he can't be all
  that bad. And anyway its not all his fault is it? We as supporters have to
  bear the brunt of the blame really. Mike has put so much money in to the club
  and he's lost so much through no fault of his own. I think we should give him
  a chance. I think we should give Hughton a chance, I think we should give me a
  chance and peace a chance cos really none of it FUCKING MATTERS does it?
