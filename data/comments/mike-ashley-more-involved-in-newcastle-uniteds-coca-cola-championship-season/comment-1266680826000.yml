message: "When you are a business man u have to take some risks and that is what MA was doing. He brought in KK and AL and the all didnt want his plans of selling off players and getting young kids. IF they cant work together then MA is the main man he brings in the cash so however much I love KK and AL. MA is more important to this club than those two.\r\n\r\nManagers can be replaced but not the owner who puts in his money. I have always been on MA's side and am still there so all we can do is see him disappoint me again but I have trust in this man and I know we will love him eventually."
