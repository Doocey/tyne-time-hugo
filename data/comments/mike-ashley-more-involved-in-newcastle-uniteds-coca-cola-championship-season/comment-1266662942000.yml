  maybe its time to get off Ashleys back and wait and see what happens once we
  are promoted and the transfer window opens . Lets face it he did give Hughton
  more money than anyone expected in january . Once we are back in the
  premiership their will be more revenue coming into the club and i think we
  will be active in the transfer market to insure we stay their . The problem we
  had was too many players on massive wages and that had to be stopped , ashley
  after all did pay some big transfer fees colo cost 10 million . The owen ,
  viduka , duff , Geremi sort of signings (wages) are the real reason we are in
  the ccc and Ashley needed to get rid of those "star" players
