message: "I believe we will get back into the P.L. this time running but sorry i don`t agree with the Chris is great brigade,some of the decisions made this season have been mind boggling and if we had a manager with an ounce of tactical nous we would be all but promoted by now.I also don`t agree with the old\"it`s the points that matter\" garbage either,some of the football played at SJP this season has been the worst since Charlton was here-i`m only a small lad and my neck is hanging out from looking at the high balls all the time.I`m expecting to get slagged off here but i`m a NUFC fan and a football fan,i pay a lot of money which i cannot afford on my season ticket as i have done most of my 43 yrs-but i am exactly that A FOOTBALL FAN i love football,rugby`s not my game so play fekin football.\r\n    I`m not having a go at any individual here,Chris is a smashing bloke-i`v met him so believe me he`s a smashing bloke but i don`t think he`s a manager.Ashley has an idea which i agree with in principle,i`d love to see youngster after youngster come through playing exciting passionate football but the Arsenal had a good established team before Wenger spun his magic,it was also a slow transformation-he didn`t do it over night by emptying the club of players bleeding it dry and getting them relegated. As for bailing us out of the crap-it is ONLY his own fault,he acted like a playboy clown and did not follow protocol and made both us and him look like fools and probably tarnished his business reputation beyond repair.Granted we are looking a lot better financially than we have done in a long time but this is by fault and not design-he didn`t want nor intend to do this,he was stuck with it.\r\n The team needs a massive overhaul if we get promoted and massive financial investment which will not be forthcoming,at times this season we haven`t looked good enough for the championship-the premiership will eat us alive with the current batch no matter how hard they try.\r\n  That`s just my opinion \"stand by for incoming\"\r\n     C`MON THE TOON....."
