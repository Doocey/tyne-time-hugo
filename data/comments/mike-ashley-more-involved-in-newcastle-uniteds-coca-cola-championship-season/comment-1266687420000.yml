  alan p! u are spot on about CH he is cluelass we would have had at least 10
  more points because of his team selection or not bringing or changing it
  before it is to late!why did he play butt nolan and smith against leicester
  and why didnt he change it when down to ten men then every1 slags him off and
  plays are team next game and win must get sacked if we go up not 4 or 5 games
  into the season and then sack him which will be that i think.
