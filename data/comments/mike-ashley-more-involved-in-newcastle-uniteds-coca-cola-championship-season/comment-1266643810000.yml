  John Berg you live in the past. The way you describe MA can be used to
  describe 90% of chairmen. People need to wake up and stop getting emotional
  attachments to players because we are in the era of 'everyone has their
  price'. And I even believe the top four are now included in that. We aren't in
  a position to hold on to players as we are not a top team. If Taylor gets a
  call from Chelsea tomorrow do you honestly believe he will want to stay? No
  matter what these mercenaries say in 5he press, all they care about is playing
  at the top level and earning the pay cheques to match it.
