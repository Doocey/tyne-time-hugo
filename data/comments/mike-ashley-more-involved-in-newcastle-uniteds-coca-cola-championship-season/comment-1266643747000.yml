  Chris Bell how do you mean he has lost money through no fault of his own?? At
  the end of the day it was Ashley that was stupid enough to take the club on
  without doing due diligence so that is entirely his fault. Totally agree with
  John Berg it will take a lot for me to trust the fat man again if that will
  ever happen.
