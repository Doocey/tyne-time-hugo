message: "Why is it that someone has to come on to these blogs &amp; slag off the person who wrote them, why is that?? is it because they don't have the common sense to actually write something themselves or is it because they just don't have any common sense full stop? Btw, if you didn't get that, it was meant for your Dave!!!\r\nPersonally I think Doocey has written a decent blog here &amp; I have to agree that if we hadn't sold off Â£40m in crap players, we'd be doing what Leeds have done &amp; Pompey are doing as we type, so if you can't make sensible comment, don't bother commenting moron"
