  I agree about Hughton, he seem like a great man and he loves the club. I hope
  you say the same thing about your nice mr Ashley when he will sell Steven
  Taylor, Andy Caroll and Fabricio Coloccini to the highest bidder when the
  transfer marked is back on even if they want to stay newcastle players. They
  man has no heart for this club! You say give him a chance, he has had lots of
  them! Even wanted to earn money on the stadium name!
