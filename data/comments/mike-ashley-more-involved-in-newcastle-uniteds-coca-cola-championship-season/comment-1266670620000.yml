message: "Looking at this from a long term prospective!\r\n\r\nIt looks as if we will be going back up in May, providing we don,t start losing games and being too arrogant about opposing teams ( like against The Rams ). There are a lot of teams fighting to go up and it could if we are not careful go wrong for us!\r\n\r\nAs far as FA is concerned, i worry about his intentions after promotion. He has been extremely naive if you look at some of the decisions made in the last two years.\r\nHopefully we won,t turn into a yoyo club and come back down the year after, which for me would be a doom scenario!\r\n\r\nThey need to build in a wage structure, and keep to it in the Premiership! No ridiculous signings and over the top wages for arrogant Prima Donna,s who don,t produce on the pitch. In the last few months we have been lucky that some of the other results have gone in our favour.\r\nI,me hopimg that Ashley is not gonna screw up the club again after Promotion!"
