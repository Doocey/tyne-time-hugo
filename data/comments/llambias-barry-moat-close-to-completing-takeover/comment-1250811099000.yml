  I agree Moat would be the prefered option but we still wont know until it's
  officially anounced i'm hoping it's sooner rather than later as the transfer
  windows getting smaller and smaller and surely they'll be looking to add to
  the squad i dont know how the financial side works but i would hope by now
  that if Moat ( or anyone else )buys the club it would take immediate effect
  and you would hope they'd look to strenghten the squad as quick as possible
