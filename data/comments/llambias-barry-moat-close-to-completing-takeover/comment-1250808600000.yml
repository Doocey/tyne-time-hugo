  Yeah, the transfer market will play a vital role in our season this time.

  It's what got us relegated last year to an extent.

  Shearer who hopefully will be appointed, will look for targets straight away,
  my only concern is, if Moat's having problems raising money to buy the club,
  where's he going to get the money for the wage bill and transfers?

  Interesting to see who the other bidder(s) are..
