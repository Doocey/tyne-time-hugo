  Yeah that's a nagging doubt its all very well buying the club but will he have
  the funds to sustain the club i mean at the minute we know were we are with
  Ashley i.e. he has no intentions of spending anymore money on the club my fear
  would be Moat can buy the club but have nothing left for players which we
  desperatley need its a very long season and we will have injuries and we need
  to make sure we have good players to step in when needed i'd hate to see us
  say have a great two thirds of the season then get hit by injuries with no
  proper cover for the final third because of lack of funds
