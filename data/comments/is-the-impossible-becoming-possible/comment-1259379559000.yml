message: "Talk about jumping the gun.  It’s only three week since the ground was given the stupidest name in world football in exchange for no money at all, two weeks since any suppoter with a banner complaining about this was kicked out the ground, a month since Lambias was running round the pitch with his penis out, a couple of months since the club admitted lying to supporters about who was in charge of transfers. The team are doing well in a very weak league but there are no real signs Mr Ashley is learning how to be a decent owner. It’s testament to his tenure so far that two weeks without a PR disaster and the bloggers are talking about stability and imploring us to jump on the I love mike bandwagon. \r\n\r\nThe transfer window is month away, let’s see what happens then. More importantly let’s see what happens in the summer if we do gain promotion. A lack of investment will surely bring a lot of poor results and a much needed reality check."
