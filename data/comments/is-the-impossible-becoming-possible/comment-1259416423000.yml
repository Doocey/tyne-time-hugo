message: "One question to all! Including mr stardust!\r\nWhat has mike Ashley done that is good for our club? \r\nSend answers to sportsdirect.com@mikeslittlefunhouse.co.Uk!\r\nMike Ashley has made a mess if everything he has touched in the last\r\n2-3 years!! FACT! \r\nWe have had a modicum of success in the chmpionship, a very poor league I hasten to add!\r\nBut I add, it is very early days, and more importantly, the team have got us where we are NOT\r\nmike Ashley and not Derek lamearse! And like any decent club owner should, he should be thanking the \r\nthe people who are papering over the cracks, and trying to pull him out the do-do!\r\nNow don't get me wrong! Worst that could happen now is Jabba leave the club and handover to someone else! I am all for stability now! But once stabilized! You FB get out of our club!!"
