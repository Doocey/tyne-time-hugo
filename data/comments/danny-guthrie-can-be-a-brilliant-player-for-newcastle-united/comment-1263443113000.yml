message: "Guthrie has some potential definitely a raw talent. Scottishmag what are talking about, Guthrie has 8 assists this season.\r\n\r\nGuthrie's flaws:\r\n\r\nTakes to long to Pass, so the opportunity and to attack is lost\r\nDoes stupid useless turn after turn with the ball when he is actually beating no one but himself and wasting time.\r\nGives away the ball WAY TOO MUCH in recent games, his passing has been shish this season if I'm honest(in contradiction of Keegans' he's a liverpool boy doesn't give away the ball good passing etc. sorry but NOT THIS SEASON, he can't pass for shish).\r\n\r\nGuthrie's Strengths:\r\n\r\nHis only strength this season has been his crossing, I think all of his 8 assists or at least most of them have been crosses from the right wing."
