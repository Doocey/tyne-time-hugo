message: "Re Guthrie\r\n\r\nI am still undecided regarding him; over the past 2 seasons I have seen him play he has had some shockers aand has deserved to be subbed and dropped.  I also believe he is not the snswer playing wide right as he continually cuts inside (except for the peach of a pass for that goal).\r\n\r\nIt is the worst kept secret that we wanted Kilgallon, Beckford and Simpson; but am I on my own in saying we have a crying need for a WIDE RIGHT PLAYER to balance our team, this is so obvious when I watch us play.\r\n\r\nIf we could only have one new player coming in, then this is the position I would look to strengthen.  Lovenkrands, Guthrie, Taylor R and Pancrates have all been given their chance, not to mention Barton when he was briefly fit and none have shown they could hold their place.\r\n\r\nEvery opposition manager knows to attack us down this flank is the most effective way to break us down.\r\n\r\nRealistically who could we afford to get for this position?\r\n\r\nDooce could you do a separate blog on this if you think it has any mileage?"
