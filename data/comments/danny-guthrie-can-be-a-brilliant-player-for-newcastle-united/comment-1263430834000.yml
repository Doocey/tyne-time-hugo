message: "Only in this league is guthrie a good player. Does not score enough goals. Assists are too rare. When out wide does not have the pace to go round the full back. Does not have quick feet. First instinct is to pass backwards.\r\nIf and when you go to games do you never wonder why all our attacking play is down our left side. Coz that is where all our skill is.\r\nPoint proven spidey just laid a goal on for lover boy"
