  I think it would be a savvy addition if we can pull it off but only at a fair
  price..That being said another player i would like to see us pursue in the
  summer is Stephen Ireland seems as if he is a surplus at City and would be an
  excellent addition for Newcastle a midfielder with some pace and flair..What
  do u think?
