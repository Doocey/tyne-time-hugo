message: "I,me still not satisfied with our form in the last few games.\r\nAlthough against Leicester the Ref had more to do with the result, we had a bad game but the Ref was atrocious.\r\nThe fact that Jonas sat on the bench for the whole game was also a puzzle for me!\r\nHopefully it,ll go better  on Friday!"
