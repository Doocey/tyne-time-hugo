message: "We are hopefully getting our act together and now have a solid squad - and if we can get promotion in May - maybe 4 good players will be enough. With 5 strikers we'll probably sell at least one in the summer - maybe Shola. But let's hope we are on the right track - a very very good January transfer window. \r\nKeep up the good work Kevin!"
