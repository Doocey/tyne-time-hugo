message: "A few observations if I may.\r\n\r\nSo we now have a chairman/owner that is fully committed?  I question this as it seems very convenient that after two failed attempts to 'bail out', this is now the case.  Committed to the club and not having an exit route are two very different things.\r\n\r\nWe also have a chairman/owner that demonstrates his commitment by keeping our club afloat with countless millions in loans, which its fair to assume will need to be paid back at some point.  Again I question the motive.  Commitment to our club through choice?  Or the shoring up of a failing asset that if promoted could once again return to something close to its previous value.\r\n\r\nSome of the comments I've read today seem to have come from some fans with increasingly short or failing memories.  Whilst the Ashley regime is not wholly responsible for our financial plight, lets not readily sweep under the carpet the fact that the financial stabilisation of our club would have been a much less painful task with the revenues that come with a premier league place.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally (going over old ground I know) but after the findings of the Keegan tribunal its a teeny weeny (understating) bit difficult to trust anything that Ashley and especially his clueless MD say or do, which probably explains a lot of the above."
