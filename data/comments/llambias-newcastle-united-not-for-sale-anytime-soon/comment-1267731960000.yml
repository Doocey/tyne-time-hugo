message: "Well said alexkid.\r\n\r\nSpot the timing of this, just as season tickets go up for sale. How can you believe the club isn't up for sale, just no one about has the money to invest. I heard something, take it with a large pinch of salt though.... There is already an agreement in place that if Newcastle are promoted they will be sold. Like I said though, take it with a pinch of salt."
