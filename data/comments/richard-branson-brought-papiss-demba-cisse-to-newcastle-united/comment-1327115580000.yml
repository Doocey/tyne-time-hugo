  The maths are easy to do but with the club supposedly looking to break even at
  the next year end its still a guessing game whether Fatso can resist making
  Â£20m profit on Tiote or Ba or Cabaye..........................? IMO the jury's
  still out on the two crooked muppets. 


  However if they leave the squad alone and get Colo to sign a new long term
  contract then maybe, just maybe, we can start to trust this Board ? Something,
  I admit, I thought I'd never ever say.
