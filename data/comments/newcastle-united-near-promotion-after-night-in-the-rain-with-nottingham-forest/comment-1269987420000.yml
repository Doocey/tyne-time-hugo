  Thought shola played a great game last night comes back and takes over were he
  left off,half a chance,1 shot 1v0 newcastle thanks very much shola, and dont
  forget the 2 fingers to these fools that want to sell ya mate.Think if shola
  had not got injured he would have been our player of the season by far with at
  least 30 to 40 goals for the season.Love the back heel for the second mate, if
  messi had done that, we would be watching the replays on sky sports til at
  least the world cup i think.1 more point extend CH contract as soon as
  possible, and let him start worry about the future of nufc,instead of this
  crap that he wont be here next season.Looking forward to the big games in the
  prem already,1 very happy nufc fan.
