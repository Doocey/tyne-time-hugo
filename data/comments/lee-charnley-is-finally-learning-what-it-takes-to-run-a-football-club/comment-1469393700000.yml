  Charnley was out of his depth last season as he was part of the decision
  makers who were buying and selling players. Now Rafa is making those decisions
  and Charnley is being left to do the deals. Similarly with Carr, he's back to
  scouting rather than trying to run the club and recommending new chief coaches
  (McClaren). It all makes much more sense and finally we seem to be a properly
  run club that has began to repair relationships with the fans and the media.
  Long may it continue and hopefully will result in promotion back to the PL.
  fingers crossed.
