  I think we should get him in on loan again till the end of the season for the
  simple fact that he is and always has been a championship striker. I remember
  thinking that when he used to play for West Ham. I doubt we wouldnt be able to
  prise 2 from the other 4, but now that he has got himself fit and scored 4
  goals he has done enough to justify a stay till the end of the season and he
  does work hard. That said I would like to see him jump for the ball a bit
  more. If we could get someone like Machada in though definately release.
