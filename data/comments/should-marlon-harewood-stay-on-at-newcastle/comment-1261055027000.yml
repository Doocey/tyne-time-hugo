message: "I would normally have said NO until Carroll's antics. He's put himself in the 'dodgy' category with his nightclub, police antics and yellow cards.\r\nThat leaves \r\nShola - injury prone\r\nLovenkrands - family issues with a sick father and\r\nRanger - young and inexperienced\r\n\r\nWe need Marlon as the fact is that our entire attack could disappear overnight."
