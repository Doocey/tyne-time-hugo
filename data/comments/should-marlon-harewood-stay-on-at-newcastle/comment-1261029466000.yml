  Yeh should keep till end of the championship but he aint gonna cut starting in
  the premiership. I remember watching him play for west ham and thinking then
  he was a proper donkey little did I know he'd end up here, the only decent
  game I saw him play for west ham was when he scored against man utd. Not
  technicaly good enough in imo
