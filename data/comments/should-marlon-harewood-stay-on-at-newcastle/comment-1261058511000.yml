  I hope we keep booth Simpson and Harewood! We sign Simpson permanently and
  Harewood get a longer loan deal! I am not agree with "DONALDO", we dont need
  to use Harewood as a cover for Ranger. Ranger is for young and he should be
  cover for Harewood. I also hope we can sign Kris Boyd from Rangers! If we can,
  I already can smell Premiership! We also need to keep our squad, and not loose
  someone. I also hope we can get Kilgallon! Then smells good!
