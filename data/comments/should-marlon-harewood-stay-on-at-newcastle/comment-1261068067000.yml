  Marlon has done well and seems a great guy who has shown his character and has
  4 goals too. But I think he will stop the progress of Nile Ranger and Andy
  Carroll and he's also costing us 20K/week in wages. I think he'll go - but if
  he stays I wouldn't be too bothered - he seems a good man and is starting to
  score goals for us - but I cannot see him be a star in the Premier league.
