message: "For a guy that is hugely strong and fast he doesn`t really get himself about and let the defenders know they are in a game(like wor andy does)half as much as he should do.\r\nI would also keep him to the end of the season,but Premiership quality he definitely is not.\r\nGive Nile some more time on the pitch,now that he has got his first goal too.\r\nNUFC FOREVER is wrong saying Nile is too young,Was Rooney/Owen/Gerrard/Scholes/Beckham+++++++too young to start playing for their clubs?????\r\nThey needed time in the first team before they became class players"
