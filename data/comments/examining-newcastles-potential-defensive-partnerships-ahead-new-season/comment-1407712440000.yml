  Come on really ?? Colo has been poor of late I didn't. See today's game but
  the close of last season and in pre season he has been well below par... And
  as for you comment about MYM Is good at reading the game ... Really ? Everton
  last season he must have been reading the bill boards. Against Malaga he was
  terrible as well... Mike is the 1st name on the sheet !! The line up won't be
  too different to the line up today !! Tiote and De Jong will come back in if
  fit.... 4-5-1 or 4-4-1-1 ... Sissoko might end up more central if De Jong Is
  back Cabella will shift out wide
