  Thanks for your comment.



  Not sure you read the article correctly though, I don't believe I said MYM is
  good at reading the game? 



  Regardless, I do think he has the potential to be an excellent defender -
  hence why Mike Ashley was persuaded to part with the guts of Â£7m for him, big
  money in 2012!

  He needs time to adjust to the division, and will only get that with playing
  time, much like Coloccini on his arrival.



  Agree with you about Sissoko though, I'd love to see him in a more central
  position, box to box, as is his natural game. That looks a tad unlikely though
  considering our competition for the central mid places, and the lack of it on
  our right hand side.
