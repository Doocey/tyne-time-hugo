  Mym should get as many chances as colo, whether its through cup games or
  during hectic schedule like 2 matches in a week , we should switch players and
  give each of them a chance. Mym can still improve and adapt. It took colo 2
  years to play good in the premiere at his preferred role, for me mym can too
  and is still young with bags of potential can pass, not afraid to hold on to
  the ball and is composed just like the captain. With confidence i believe
  he'll be even better than colo. Come on pardew give the lad a chance.
