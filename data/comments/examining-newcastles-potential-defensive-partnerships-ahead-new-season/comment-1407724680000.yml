  I hated watching that game against everton. I remember in the half time
  commentary the guys were talking and trying to blame Collo. Then Neville
  showed the replay and you could just see Mbiwa, standing there, staring like a
  goof. 



  Pardew also recognized the issue and swapped Williamson at half time and we
  didn't concede again. It was a brilliant substitution. 



  I read another article on here about Cabella not being a perfect replacement
  for Cabaye. Everyone seems to forget that in Cabayes first few games, he
  didn't come across as amazing either. He had to adapt first and then became
  himself.
