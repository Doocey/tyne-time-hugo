  I keep reading people's comments on various forums, about how good they
  believe MYM is, almost to the point of suggesting he's fantastic.

  Personally, I can't for the life of me understand just where these people are
  coming from, are they watching a different game, or are they basing their
  opinions of what he did back in France?



  So far, in this country, MYM has been poor, his reading of the game, touch,
  effectiveness, lack of heading ability, speed of thought and the time he takes
  to decide what to do, just simply aren't up to the required standard or a
  Premier league centre-back.



  If his speed of thought, distribution and decision making were better Willo
  would be our best defender. However those points are what separates
  Premiership from Championship level defenders and I'm afraid Mike for all his
  skills and performances is a Championship level player, who's playing above
  his level.



  Taylor is a defender who showed great talent and ability up until he was about
  22, even spotlighted as a future England captain. However a series of injuries
  and loss of form have seen his progress halt and then regress to a certain
  extent. He has too many shortcomings to go into detail about and his lack of
  decisiveness and constant negative play add to his weaknesses.



  Colo had been the only quality centre-back we possessed, but the failed
  transfer to his home club of San Lorenzo and the fallout which followed left
  him looking like a player who wanted away. Sadly that is still how he appears,
  regardless of what the rhetoric is with regards to his intentions. From
  Christmas last season, along with the majority of the team, Colo was
  diabolical, the commanding talisman at the back, our leader and captain was
  less than a shadow of his former self. The season before last he was equally
  poor, yet he's still trusted with the captaincy.



  It was obvious to everyone who watched us last season after the departure of
  Cabaye, that we needed replacements desperately.

  But of the positions and in order of necessity, it was strikers THEN
  centre-backs, followed by replacements for those who were sold/loans ended and
  finally midfield.

  If we don't get a centre-back signed, and in all honesty it currently doesn't
  look as if we're even looking, either Curtis Good needs to break into the
  first team within the first couple of months. Or come Christmas we're going to
  find ourselves too far behind the top 4 to even have remote hope of catching
  them.
