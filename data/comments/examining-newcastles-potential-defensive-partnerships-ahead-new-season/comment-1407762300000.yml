  Mbiwa had a bad start, no doubt, but a few bad games doesn't take away from
  his undoubted potential. Thus guy captained Montpellier to the league title
  months previous to arriving on Tyneside, which says something about his
  qualities regardless of the competition in Ligue 1.



  About Cabella, he'll need time to adjust as well, as you rightly mention. I
  remember Cabaye's opener against Arsenal at St. James' - he looked like a
  player that was very much still getting to grips with the pace and physicality
  of the division. 



  Signs from Cabella early-on look encouraging though, and despite comparisons
  to Yohan â€” Siem de Jong is his more natural replacement. Cabella gives us an
  outlet on the wing, and that's where I expect him to play.



  De Jong could be the star man for us much like Cabaye and naming his as
  vice-captain already puts down quite a marker for the Dutchman I think.



  Thanks for reading, and indeed commenting.
