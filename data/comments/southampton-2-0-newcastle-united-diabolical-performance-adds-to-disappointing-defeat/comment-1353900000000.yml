  Look at the goals tonight. Stop the replay and consider where Williamson
  should have been had he had à brain in that head of his. Righto... And Then
  consider why you keep à slow CB with no technique and poor decisionmaking on
  the pitch when he doesnt win à single header. Horrible!

  I feel bad for Fergie and Sammy, they are not ready, clearly, and with à
  decent squadsize they wouldnt have to be. 9 injuries Is tough on any team,
  especially one whos captain thinks its à good idea to get redcarded when hes
  needed the most.

  Oh and Dont freaking sub Anita when hes the only one creating something. 

  Nuff said.
