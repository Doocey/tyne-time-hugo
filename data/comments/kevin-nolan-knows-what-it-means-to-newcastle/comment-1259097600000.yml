  Also in response on the Harewood attack, while i agree he certainly isnt good
  enough to be kept on board i think his performances have steadilly improved.
  Yesterday he didnt win enough in the air that could be buildt upon and he did
  seem to lose the ball a few times. However his link up play was slightly
  better and he placed a few good balls out to the wing on a few occasions that
  gave Jonas a chance to whip a ball in..which more times than not ended in a
  corner. Fortunately he also heard Nolans call to leave it in time to let the
  ball drop to him or we could have been discussing a different result. Best
  thing to do would be to give him the support while he's here, im sure the
  confidence boost wouldnt hurt, then peddle him back off to Villa in january.
  Simple.
