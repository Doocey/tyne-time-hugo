message: "Agree, Harewood has never been a great technical player relying on a more physical game, watched him give Shay a bad injury at Upton Park and it`s  becoming obvious he will never be a crowd favorite, many already getting on his case. \r\nWe need help in regards to goalscoring, apart from Ranger (not quite ready yet) not impressed by any of the others.\r\nHave to say we are playing better defensively, probably has more to do with the opposition I think.\r\nThere`s still a lot of games to be played, but this side seems to be capeable  of scraping  a win, although ugly at times.\r\nHowever, would`nt want to compete in the PL with this side, just not good enough, need to unload the deadwood and strengthen, in order to survive that critical first season.  \r\nHope that`s understood by \"the man\"."
