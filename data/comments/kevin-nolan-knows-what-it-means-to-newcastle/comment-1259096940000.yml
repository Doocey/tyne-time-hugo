  While yesterday was hardly a steam roller job, I left the game content with a
  job well done and somewhat shocked by some of the post match reaction.  I was
  critical of Hughton in the opening months for our one dimentional, route one
  approach to every game, however in recent i've noticed a change. Looking at
  our last three victories as a case in point we have actually started to get
  the ball down and play abit more making us far more effective and controlling.
  I had become used to watching every game and wearing my fingers to the knub
  worrying that a goal could come at anytime and from anywhere. This season
  watching a game i get a different kind of feeling. Looking at yesterday there
  never really felt (other than one or two brief scares) that Preston were going
  to trouble us..even ambling towards the end of the game I was still confident
  we would score. The feeling in the squad is different, we finally have a group
  of players that understand what it means to don the black and white. The
  bottom line of all this being that it was another sturdy away victory, against
  another team that i believe will be in or around the playoffs and promotion
  spots. Alongside victories away at Cardiff, Sheffield United and the point
  taken at West Brom I'd say we're in better shape than any of us would have
  dared to believe in at the start of the season. Another good victory and
  another big step towards promotion..Howay the lads!
