  I have to agree with Tel aswell. Ashley is up to the same old tricks if he
  puts our club up for sale again. He's done it some many times I'm suprised it
  would not be the first thing to come into any Geordies head when hearing this
  news. The man is a liar and will always try to decieve the fans. He's not goin
  anywhere until we are back in the premiership and he will find any way
  possible to avoid giving the team the funds they need in order for us to be
  sure of promotion. Unfortunately we're stuck with the burger lovin larger
  guzzling fat ass lying excuse for a buisness man for at least another 6 months
