  I agree that we are always for sale at the right price and as such this is not
  a story. Sounds more like the tabloids wanting a story about NUFC. We have
  provided so much good copy to these hacks for years but suddenly its all gone
  quiet - we're winning, no scandals, no instability, no dressing room spats and
  the press cant sell papers on headlines like that. I'm sure they would have
  loved us to have gone into freefall instead of sitting ten points clear of the
  play-offs - long may the silence continue.
