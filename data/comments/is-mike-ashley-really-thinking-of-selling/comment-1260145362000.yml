  Think theres a pattern here, lets see, say the club is for sale during
  transfer window, no need to invest in players, make it impossible to buy then
  take it off the market when window closes. This man continues to lie and
  mislead, having said that I am inclined to agree that we dont need the boat
  rocking and he should sell in the close season, I have no problem arranging a
  deal behind the scenes but keep it totally underwraps until this season is
  over.
