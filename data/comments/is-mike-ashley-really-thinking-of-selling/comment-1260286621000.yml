  Announcing that the club is up for sale and possibly to be sold in JANUARY, is
  ANOTHER diversionary tactic by Ashley to take our minds off the fact that he
  won't be shelling out any more money for players during the transfer window in
  JANUARY. And if he manages to sell a few (e.g. Taylor to Everton for Â£6m) he
  can do so in the knowledge that the fans are expecting an imminent sale and
  new owners 'any day now'. The sale of the club WON'T happen in January, but NO
  players coming IN but SOME going OUT, is the more realistic scenario.
