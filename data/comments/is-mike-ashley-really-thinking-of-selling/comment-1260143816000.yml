  Doocey - I think if Mike Ashley can sell the club for say 100M pounds in early
  Jan that would be good. If the new owners can then give around 10M pounds for
  new players in January, they would almost guarantee promotion and a Premier
  League side in May. It would be a terrific bargain. So far the lads (players)
  have been outstanding - they are everything they were not last season - guts
  and spirit galore - long may it continue.
