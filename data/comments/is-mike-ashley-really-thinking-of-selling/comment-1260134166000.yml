  We all want cashley to sell but what people dont understand is that yeah you
  can buy the club for 80-100 million and that will buy you the club but then
  the club will still have a dept of 100-150 million that cashley loaned the
  club to sort the mess out left by freddy and the halls.the true cost of buying
  the club and getting rid of cashley is 200-250 million puts a diffrent slant
  on things and that is why no one has bought us and why the fans nust buyout is
  a none starter.
