  Shocking, negative tactics have cost us yet again. How many times are we going
  to drop points because of awful tactics? I'm growing tired of Hughton.
  Everyone knows Leicesters strengths lay in their defense, so why go into the
  game with 1 striker and a 5 man midfield consisting of 4 central
  midfielders?!? A Lack of wingmen is no longer an excuse. Shocking
