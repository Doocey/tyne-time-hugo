  Im not too sure what the problem is hes quite established in the team and done
  very well this season with colo taylor and enrique. surely paying a bit more
  in wages would justify the small fee we have agreed to sign him permanantly
  rather than having to go and spend a few million in the summer for a new right
  back doesnt make sense to me.
