message: "I think simpson is an average championship defender..nothing to get excited about.There are much better players around.If you look at the reserves of some of the premier league teams like Liverpool(who are top of the reserve league)and arsenal who's youngsters are top notch.Steven Darby is a good right back could definitely leave on loan for the rest of the season,also Nathen Eccelstone is also a very promising young forward.\r\nanother place to look is Scotland.Celtic seem to be having a lot of problems keeping players(with the mass exodus in the last few days!)players such as Mcgeady,Hinkel and Crosas would be quality additions to our squad.rangers two most promising youngsters John Fleck and Danny Wilson have both rejected new contracts,and look likely to leave.These would be quality additions!\r\nI would as love to see Nickey Maynard in a Newcastle shirt with all the speculation mounting I hope to see him soon!"
