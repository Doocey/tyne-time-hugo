message: "Of course his agent is asking for what he believes he can get, it`s a negotiation and unless one or both sides are very far apart it can be worked out.\r\nWith promotion comes in most cases an overall raise in both wages and outgoing but also a serious raise in revenue.\r\nThe bean counters are now more numerous than the football people on these blogs, amazing really how the ownership has managed to co-opt these people and get them to blog showing a concern in regards to what is affordable and whats not.\r\nScrew the money, I just want to see a good team out there and to hell with parsimony."
