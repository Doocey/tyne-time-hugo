  Simpson is a mediocre player, so if he is asking for anything more than
  mediocre wages, he should be told to sling his hook.  In every game he has
  played for us he has been pretty much anonymous - admittedly not an altogether
  bad thing for a defender.  But compare him with our other full-back, Enrique. 
  Enrique really struggled throughout his two seasons in the Premiership with
  us, and yet he is one of the Championship’s top performers.  Simpson is fairly
  average at Championship level, and he hasn’t given one performance in a black
  and white shirt that might suggest he will be able to cut it in the
  Premiership.  And you have to wonder why Man U didn’t want him back despite
  having the biggest defensive injury crisis we’ve ever seen, preferring to play
  midfielders in defence rather than recall an actual defender.  Hardly a
  ringing endorsement for Simpson.  The bottom line is this – he isn’t a
  Premiership player, so isn’t worth Premiership wages.  He’ll be ok for us
  until the end of this season, but if we get promoted we’ll end up in the same,
  familiar position - paying big wages to a player who is utterly useless in the
  Premiership.
