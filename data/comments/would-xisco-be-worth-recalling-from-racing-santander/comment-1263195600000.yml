message: "Can you blame Xisco for feigning injury to get out of toon last season?\r\n\r\nYou are a young foreing lad from Spain thinking you are joining a Massive Club that will be challenging for 7th place.....\r\n\r\nYou come in to find out that the manager doesn't want you there.....\r\n\r\nYou come in to find out that YOU are the reason the manager, the great Messiah Kevin Keegan walked (really going to make you feel like the fans will take to you)....\r\n\r\nYou play only 2 matches the whole season and are thrown in the reserves(He did very well for the reserves BTW).......\r\n\r\nAnd you have 4 different managers.........\r\n\r\nI DON'T BLAME XISCO AT ALL, WE SHOULD BRING HIM BACK IF WE ARE STRUGGLING FOR STRIKERS."
