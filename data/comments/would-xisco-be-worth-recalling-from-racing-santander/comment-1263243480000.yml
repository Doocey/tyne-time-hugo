  Stating a fact Ameobi has scored a few goals against poor opposition but what
  else has he done in matches except walk around pitch and needlessly foul
  players. Don't get me wrong he'd be in my starting XI at current and id have
  him over Harewood &amp; Lovenkrands anyday. But his problem is he thinks he's
  better than he actually is.
