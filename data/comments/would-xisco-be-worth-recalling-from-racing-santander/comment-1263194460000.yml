message: "in a word, no.\r\n\r\nhe doesn't want to play for us, has said as much himself and from the sounds of it is a petulant sod to boot.\r\n\r\nironically, sounds a bit like beckford, but then i'm wary of us signing him too.\r\n\r\nfrankly, Xisco is exactly the sort of player we don't need at the club and Ranger may only have one goal to his name too, but at least he plays like he wants to do well for the team and is happy to play the role asked of him by the management."
