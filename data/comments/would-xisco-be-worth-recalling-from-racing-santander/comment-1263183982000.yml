message: "Watched him last night was nothing special and didn't seem to have determination or pure quality, which you need both or alot of one to survive in English football. His 18 year old team mate however was a different class and if Ashley wants youngsters we should look no further.\r\n\r\nHe faked an injury to get out of the toon so don't want to see him around anymore to be honest. For his wages, would prefer Harewood as he certainly got some important goals."
