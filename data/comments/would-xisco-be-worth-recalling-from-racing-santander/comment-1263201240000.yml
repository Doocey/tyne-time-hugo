  Looked too good in the reserves. I think he should be given a fair crack at
  this level. This is the guy who had a better goal to game ratio than fernando
  torres in the spainish u21 remember. Despite what people say, actually has
  bags of pace and skill. Would do well under a manager like Hughton and team
  spirit the way it is. To be fair the lad did get kicked from pillar to post
  abit. Didn't cost Â£5.75M for nowt.
