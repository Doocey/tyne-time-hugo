  Spot on! The Championship never fails to surprise us and it's a dangerous time
  for the top teams if they think the lower clubs who are fighting for survival
  will be an easy kill. If you're going to the Prem, I just hope we go with you
  automatically. The thought of having to play the likes of Swansea, Blackpool
  or Cardiff in the play-offs just fills me with horror. There's still a long
  way to go...see you at the end of March when promotion hopes might be a bit
  clearer.
