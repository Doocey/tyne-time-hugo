  I'm really disgusted by the football market nowdays. The players are bought
  and sold as cattle, with no loyaty involved whatsoever. And can we really
  blame them. Can I say I wouldn't go crazy if someone would be daft enough to
  give me thousands and thousands of pounds every week? I can't... But just a
  thought of Boumsong and Luque makes me shiver.


  Although Keegan was not backed in the transfer market, I'm actually happy with
  the quality of players brought in, I'm just dissapointed there haven't been 4
  or 5 more player coming in. And to sell Milner was pretty sad. He may not have
  been Ronaldo but he worked very hard and as a honest football fan I quite like
  that...


  Cmon, Ashley, let's see DA moneeeey :)


  Cheers!
