  As a Leeds fan, I can tell you that Leeds have no problems losing Beckford for
  free in June if we're a Championship club - Everyone is a winner! Jermaine
  owes us nothing, he could easily have left after our previous 2 failed
  attempts to get out of this league. He has shown no desire to leave Leeds, he
  hasn't asked for a transfer just simply doesn't agree with the terms offered.
  If he is still with us come Springtime and with promotion secured i'm sure the
  contract offered will be revised... we'll see...
