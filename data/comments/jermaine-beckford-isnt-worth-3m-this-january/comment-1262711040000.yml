  As a Leeds fan, we should should sell for 3m, given he can leave for nothing
  at the end of the season. Is he a premier league stiker though? One goal
  against Man U does not mean he is. Given that they look likely to be going
  back to the premier league, that would mean Newcastle fork out 3m for a player
  who will probably be no use to them at the end of the season.
