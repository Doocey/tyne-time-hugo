message: "I am firm in the belief that Newcastle will not pay anythng more than 2-2.5 million for the player.\r\n\r\nI am rather shocked at the attitude of a lot of people who claim he may not be able to cut it in the PL or even the championship?\r\n\r\nYes..it was only 1 game on sunday; but did he not give Wes brown the complete run around? The same wes Brown who has played for Man Utd and England for many years now? \r\n\r\n2-2.5 million does not buy you a lot in the market these days; but a player with pace, potential and in his prime whom is hungry to prove himself sounds like a \"gamble\" that i and CH would certainly look to take.\r\n\r\nAs for Kilgallon; he is a fine young English player just entering his prime; very much in the mould of phil jagielka and everyone has seen how well he has gone on to do with everton.\r\n\r\nI think this article is rather derogatry to both players and the club. I could name at least 10 PL teams who would take both players in their squads. To sign the pair for less than 4 million combined represents great business and with a litle success in the PL: but players could go on to command transfer fee's in excess of 10million each being english and still at a good age!"
