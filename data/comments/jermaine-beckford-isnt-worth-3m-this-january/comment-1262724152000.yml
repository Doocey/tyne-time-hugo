message: "I would be happy if they sold for £1-2M, but £3M is just taking the p### for a League 1 player with a questionable attitude and a goal against a Man U reserve defense. All the other goals are against mickey mouse teams remember.\r\n\r\nLike somebody mentioned, why dont we look at Billy Sharp and Gary Hooper instead. Im sure they are just as good, if not better and probably not full of their own self importance. Didn't this club used to have some 'big time charlies', and look how well we did then."
