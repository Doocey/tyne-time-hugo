message: "Leeds probably feel they can extort a bit more.\r\nProblem is there`s a sell on clause which gives them only a percentage of the fee received.\r\nAnd if no one meets the asking price they could attempt to re sign him.\r\nA dangerous game, they could lose him for nada.\r\nHowever i believe we will sign him for around two million."
