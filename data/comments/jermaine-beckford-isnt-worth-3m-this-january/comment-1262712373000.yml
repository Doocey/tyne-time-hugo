message: "I agree I have concerns if he is worth the 3 million quoted...\r\n\r\nHowever, if we were to sign Beckford now, If he gets say, 5-10 goals from now until the end of the season, that would certainly see us automatically promoted. Especially when you think that Nolan's 10 goals are largely the reason we are top at the moment.\r\n\r\nPeople doubt whether Beckford will be able to cut it in the premier league but its certainly worth trying, you can never be certain how a player will cope until he is actually playing.\r\n\r\nWhen you also consider the strikers we already have, Lovenkrands, Ameobi, Carroll and Ranger all came for nothing and 3 of them through the youth team, then 3 million for Beckford who is more of a natural goalscorer than all of them, doesn't seem to unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are too many decent alternatives to him in our current situation. If he isn't firing by this time next year in the premier league then by all emans look to sell him or at least loan him out. There won't be any shortage of takers..."
