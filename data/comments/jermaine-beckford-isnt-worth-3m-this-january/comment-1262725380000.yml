  Ask yourselves this. If Beckford is really that good how come no-one else seem
  to be taking a punt on him. We would be stitched up like a kipper to offer
  anywhere near £3M. Giving Leeds £3m would be like giving a tramp a thousand
  pounds. If we really think he is all that, (i dont) lets wait till the summer
  and get him for nowt.
