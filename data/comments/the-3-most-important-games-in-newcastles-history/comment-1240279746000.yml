message: "That team looks good Alan but Tayls is injured.\r\nMight have to be Edgar in the middle or switch with Beye.\r\nGood hard workin midfield though and a bit of creativity which  we definitely need.\r\nThere should be goals in that forward line too.\r\nI reckon we can win 2 home games but the Fulham game maybe a point."
