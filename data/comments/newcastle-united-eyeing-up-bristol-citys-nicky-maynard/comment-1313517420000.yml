  speaking as a Bristol City fan there is no chance you are going to be able to
  buy him for the £2m mark as we have been offered way more then that by two
  championship clubs. He wants to go to a premier club no question, but we are
  not going to sell him cut price, as we are not cash strapped (we have a rich
  backer). The deal will have to be right for city and nearer £4m in my
  opinion..
