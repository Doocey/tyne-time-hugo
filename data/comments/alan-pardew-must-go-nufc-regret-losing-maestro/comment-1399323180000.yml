  I couldn't agree less. Setting aside the Pardew debate, Ben Arfa is a complete
  waste of time. He is worse than a passenger - he's a liability. No point him
  making a goal if he makes us concede 2. As Gary Neville said about him some
  months ago on Sky - it's not enough in today's game to be good going forward;
  to justify a place at the top level a player has to be good enough in all
  aspects of the game.  I've been going to SJP for over 40 years and I cannot
  understand why so may of our fans are bowled over by show ponies - Jimmy
  Smith, Malcolm Macdonald, and Obafemi Martins to name a few. I'm afraid Ben
  Arfa is fat, unfit and has no football brain.
