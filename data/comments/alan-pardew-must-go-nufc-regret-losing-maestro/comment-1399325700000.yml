  Thanks for the comment, murvar.



  All opinions are welcomed.



  However, I agree with chuck and David - Ben Arfa's apparent regression is
  largely down to poor coaching and management.

  We saw in 2011/12 what Ben Arfa is capable - West Brom (a), Bolton (h&amp;a)
  and there are plenty others. In the right setup he can be lethal, and
  absolutely lethal at that.



  I find it confusing that you think Ben Arfa has no football brain, for me,
  he's one of the more smarter players in the team. Granted he can make some
  poor decision to check back outside a defender after beating him, but his
  vision is excellent - just look as his assist for Papiss Ciss√© against Crystal
  Palace in March; the way in which he calmly pin-points a cross in a
  high-pressure, injury time moment of the game just oozes quality in my
  opinion.
