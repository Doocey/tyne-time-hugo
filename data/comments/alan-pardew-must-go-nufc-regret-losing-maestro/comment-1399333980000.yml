  I don't get this "losing the ball" claim over HBA, of course he has a tendency
  to lose the ball, all players do. I've seen Gouffran lose the ball more times
  in a game than Hatem, more than one occasion leading to a goal, are there
  calls for him to be dropped? If Pardew says something enough times people buy
  into it, Hatem is not judged by the same credentials as other players in the
  team. Why? Because Pardew uses him as a scape goat and everyone buys into it.
  Thankfully most supporters are seeing through Pardews agenda now. HBA is a
  forward player not a right back, it's his job to create goals not prevent
  them. He has one of the best right backs in the league behind him. A decent
  manager will get him firing them in again, that manager is NOT Pardew.
