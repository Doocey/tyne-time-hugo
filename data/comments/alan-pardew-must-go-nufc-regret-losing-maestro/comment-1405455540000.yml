  Well personally I love to watch HBA play football at times he can be amazing,
  and this nonsense about him losing the ball and not tracking back is exactly
  that, nonsense I watch football allot I mean its in my blood, and player like
  Hazzard, Sanchez, Messi, C.Ronaldo they all lose the ball at times trying to
  beat defenders with trickery in their numbers, lose the ball, and then just
  stand there like thy cant believe what's just happened to them do their
  managers drop them from the team and make them train with the young ones? I
  think not they would have their tea toast and P45 next morning. The difference
  is they have a solid unit of defence behind them ready to help out when they
  do lose the ball, sadly poor Ben Arfa doesn't and has to pick up all the slack
  from pardew's mistakes. pardew has had plenty time to build a decent side with
  HBA in it and unleash the beast inside we all know he capable of. And pardew
  has failed miserably, playing most players out of position and lacking to see
  where really need's strengthening in the team. With a decent defence and
  clever central midfielders HBA could be let roam free in the wilderness of the
  opposing defence ready for that counter attack. how can pardew not see
  coloccini needs a decent partner he can rely on strong clever and with a bit
  pace to take the pressure off him in central defence, or how if sissoko played
  along side tiote in central midfield how much stronger the defence would be,
  don't get me wrong he's unbelievable going forward, but his sheer size and
  strength along side tiote's would strengthen up the middle of the park to now
  leave Cabella, Seim de jong and HBA to play along the front with a proven
  striker. Prdew for SACK now before we lose a beauty.
