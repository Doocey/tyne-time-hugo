  Unlike Murvar here, I completely agree with the article. Ben Arfa is the only
  one (with the possible exception of Sissoko) that can unlock defences. The
  chances he 'wastes' are those that he himself creates. When was the last time
  ANYONE put Ben Arfa through on goal?



  Under the right leadership, he can thrive. Can you imagine Keegan managing Ben
  Arfa as ineptly as the current manager? Thought not.



  Keep him, ditch the manager.
