  Sunderland with the same players but a different manager have proved that the
  manager can make a BIG difference.Motivation ,tactics and a different attitude
  to the game show that Pardew has not got a clue,but he does have Ashleys
  support .I wonder if Ashley had bought Spurs would be be doing things the same
  way ?.
