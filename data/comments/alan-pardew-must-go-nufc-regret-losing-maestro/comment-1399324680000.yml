  Have to disagree with the above statement.

  Why ?

  Poor management, HBA has sat on the bench only being deployed as a last resort
  when we are behind.

  And yes he seemingly did put on weight, that's also something that should have
  not been allowed by Pardew and his staff.

  Sitting on the bench is not exactly conducive as far as match fitness is
  concerned, plus it appears anyone showing a bit of flair, is immediately
  reined in and sat.

  Just as Marveaux has been for almost the entire season.

  We all remember SBR's attempt to get Robert to track back, which he finally
  gave up on, believing his ability to change the game by scoring or laying on
  the perfect pass, was more important than using him as a defender.

  HBA is similar in that regard.

  Look Pardew has had enough time to build a decent side, but he just doesn't
  understand the modern game, he has to go and be replaced by someone who does,
  if we are ever going to see any success at this club.
