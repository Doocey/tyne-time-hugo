  Who knows whats gone on behind the scenes, but certainly the

  attitude of the player in this example has been one of self-sorrow and
  disappointment

  for his current predicament, and one in which he has highlighted a desire to

  stay and fight on. Most of the players at toon just want to leave and who can

  blame them for that, so I can’t understand pardew not being sympathetic and

  understanding in this situation – when the player is demonstrating all the

  right signs of wanting to correct this situation. 

   

  Let’s face it, he’s hugely talented on the ball (no-one can

  deny that)  and wants to stay. If we sell

  him, Ashley will have to fork out serious money to find a replacement of

  anywhere near his level of quality. Simple solution is to let him stay, train

  him, coach him, make him a better player and one who works harder for the
  team.

  Its possible I’m sure. Plus the fans love watchin him, he’s magical at times

  and that’s what fills a stadium – it certainly isn’t the prospect of watching
  gosling,

  tiote, and anita in midfield I’ll tell you that! 

   

  Personally, I love him. And I for one think Newcastle are

  not in a position to sacrifice a hugely effective offensive weapon, despite
  his

  current defensive shortcomings.
