message: "Sure, the club is thin on the ground and needs srengthening.\r\nThat`s if promotion is the goal, it`s also essential in order to survive the first season back in the PL.\r\nIn which case both windows should be taken advantage of.\r\nThere are plenty of young players at the top clubs who would jump at an opportunity to have a regular first team slot in a PL side.\r\nIt will be shortsighted of the club to fail to rebuild at this time and could result in either a failure of their promotion bid or a quick relegation and back to square one."
