message: "\"Coloccini gives world class display\",\r\nthis the same Colo who everyone was slagging not so long ago ?\r\nAnd Cris Houghton is the best thing since sliced bread, hmmm !\r\nWonderful what a series of wins will do, aint it.\r\nYeah seriously it`s nice I have to admit, gettig a few wins and sitting ten points clear in the league.\r\nSee no reason why we cant get promoted behind our recent form, unless we have a series of injuries.\r\nThe only negative I can come up with is the fact we are doing so good,may give Ashley pause in considering strengthening the side for the ultimate challenge that will be the PL.\r\nStill have to strengthen during both windows, looking at this weekend`s results, Man.U.losing two in a row,Chelsea stumbling, Liverpool sinking back to mid table, it`s still anyone`s league and closer to parity than any time since the inception of the PL."
