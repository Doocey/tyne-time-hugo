  Wayne Routldge shown why he deserves a chance in the prem....clearly Ranger
  Best and Vuckic wont get the space and time they had to finish off their goals
  next season but all three took their goals well. <br><br>We were a different
  team with Routledge on. Inman is only young and not a wideman, so the
  introduction of Wayne was great and added some much needed pace to the team
  which was lacking with Nolan Smith and Inman in midfield.
