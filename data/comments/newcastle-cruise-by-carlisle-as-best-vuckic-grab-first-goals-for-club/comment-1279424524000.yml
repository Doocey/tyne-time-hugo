  i was at the game, my mam originaly bought me tickets for the carlisle end cuz
  the toon end was apparently sold owt but turning up on the day found owt there
  was 750 terrace tickets on sale me and my dad took them up like kids with
  candy, carlisle had 1 shot on target from what i remember and that was saved
  comfortably by harpy, goals were class, and could have been more! we looked
  many classes above carlisle to think there was only 1 division between us last
  season with pretty much the same squad, nolan and smith looked average,
  williamson and perch shone!
