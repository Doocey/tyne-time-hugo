  I WAS THERE TODAY, SECOND HALF WAS A GOOD GAME SLICK PASSING AND AS STATED,
  GOOD FINISHES, HARIS VUKIC LOOKED  COMMANDING THROUGH THE MIDDLE, LOOKS A VERY
  GOOD PROSPECT. NILE RANGER ALSO LOOKED THE PART SHOWING HIS STRENGHT AND
  HOLDING UP THE BALL WELL, THE GOAL WILL ALSO DO HIM GOOD! TO SUMARISE, A NICE
  WORKOUT AND A DECENT START TO PRE SEASON
