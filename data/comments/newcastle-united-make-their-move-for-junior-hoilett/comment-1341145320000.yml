  Blackburn fan here. On his day, junior can be very exciting to watch as can
  score some spectacular goals as well. He took a while to make it to first team
  level and was, honestly, useless under Big Sam - dribbled into players, rushed
  his shots etc. Then Steve Kean came along, showed some faith in him, let him
  run at players and he really started to blossom. Last season he showed some
  signs of being good but too often went back to running into players rather
  than past them and, for me, was far too frustrating - promising much but not
  delivering anywhere near as much. Would say enjoy him, but you certainly
  aren't getting the finished article, far from it.

  All the best for the new season! Hopefully see you in 2013!
