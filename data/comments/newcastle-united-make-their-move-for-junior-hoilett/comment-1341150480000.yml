  Hes a good player, but alittle overrated at the moment IMO.  He has potential,
  but let's be right, if he was as good as alot of people make out - we'd be
  talking about him heading to a bigger club than Newcastle or Munching blah
  blah.

  Im a Newcastle fan so would love to see Ben Arfa and Hiollett in the same time
  as Cisse.  But I only see us going for Hiollett coming if Ba leaves.  Should
  be an interesting window for us.

  Looks like Leon Best is on his way to Blackburn and wish him well, he'll do a
  good job there like.
