message: "Blackburn fan here -\_\n\nGreat, great player when he can be bothered. ie a couple of seasons ago.......not so much last year as Kean had lost the players a long time ago and only really 3 have performed (Yakubu, Givet and Nzonzi.....oh and Samba b4 he left).....Hoilett's only really had 2 or 3 games near the standard he used to when every week he would play amazing......I don't believe he did anything against you in that 0-0 draw we had at our place 2 seasons ago but he was taken off at half time in that game, then Enrique annihilated us (although so does every attacking full back to be fair as our wingers no longer help out our full backs)\n\nSome see Hoilett as lazy for doing no defensive work but he is given a free role on the wing.....his ability to beat players is genuinely one of the best I have ever seen in this league and he normally has a great final ball on top of a great eye for goal as well.....he has certainly scored quite a few screamers.......he has almost scored a few Ben Arfa's as well but never quite finished one off\n\nWould suit you on the wing with Ben Arfa on the other one, or both of them either side of Cisse if Ba leaves.\n\nNo offence but I would love to watch him in the champions league, and he is certainly good enough, so you weren't my first choice but at the end of the day, rather you than Spurs where players' careers go to die.\n\nGood luck for the season, I have a bit of a soft spot for Newcastle these days as you have assembled a really good team, eg Cisse, Tiote and especially Cabaye.\n\nHope we do a Newcastle and bounce back up but after players leaving along with Kean \"managing\" us it will have to be League 1 so hopefully we see you in the cup.....preferably at your place as we both know we like to play there these days haha"
