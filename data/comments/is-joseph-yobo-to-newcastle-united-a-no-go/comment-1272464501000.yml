message: "Everton supporter here.\r\n\r\nYobo did sign a four year contract last season and he is quite a high earner. So I can't see it happening to be honest. He would want Newcastle to match his salary at Everton, or at least come near to it. Plus there would be a transfer fee involved (probably £4m or so).\r\n\r\nI suppose it depends whether you think Yobo would be worth spending something like £10m (wages over 4 seasons and transfer fee).\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that he is good and a few years ago one of our better players. But he can be a bit accident prone and has lately become one of those players that the fans like to have a go at (along with Hibbert and Osman).\r\n\r\nCongratulations on walking the Championship!!"
