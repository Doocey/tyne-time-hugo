message: "Yobo would be an excellent signing. I would much rather have him than Hall in the squad. He's proven premiership quality, and 29 is not a bad age for a centre half. Onhouha would be a good signing too in my opinion, still on 23....excellent resale value. \r\n\r\nUpfront, what do people think about Carlton Cole? He hasn't been mentioned with us, but at 26, with 15 odd goals this season...he'd definitely consolidate our first season in Prem. \r\n\r\nI think the stronger and more physical, we are, the better. Enough with being linked with creative players...get a scrappy defensive mid in, because I don't think Alan Smith can do the job. I like the look of Fabrice Muamba....here's to living in Cuckoo Land"
