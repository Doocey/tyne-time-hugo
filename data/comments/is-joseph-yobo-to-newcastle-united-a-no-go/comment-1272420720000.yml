  Curtis Davies would be a great signing but would cost a lot of money. Villa
  paid Â£10m for him not long ago. I think Yobo is very under rated and would be
  a good signing, especially on a free transfer. He's got pace, an attribute
  none of our current center backs possess. I know a lot of fans won't agree
  with me but I wouldn't mind us going for Sol Campbell.
