  Yobo, if I'm not mistaken, is primarily a centre half but has occasionally
  filled in at right back.  With Coloccini, Taylor, Williamson and Kadar (and
  possibly Hall if his loan deal is made permanent), I think we already have
  enough cover at centre half.  However, we are desperately short of cover for
  both full back positions.  Simpson will struggle next season, so I'd make a
  new right back an absolute priority signing.  Plus we also need someone to
  fill in at left back during any injuries / suspensions to Enrique.  Since our
  transfer budget is likely to be limited, I don't think we can afford to sign
  an albeit good player that isn't really needed, since that would inevitably be
  at the expense of another signing that is specifically needed.
