  When I said "top club" I didn't necessarily mean Newcastle. It surprises me
  that the likes of Spurs (again), Everton (debatable), Liverpool have not made
  an approach.


  Although we (fans) all consider NUFC a special club, truth be told, at this
  moment in time, we are pretty mediocre. With the right investment and a half
  decent owner we really could be a 'top club' again. However, in terms of
  support, attendances etc, many could consider us a 'top club'.



  Anyway, the fact is: NUFC are a bigger club that Queens Park Rangers - hence
  why I'm disappointed that he looks to be making the switch to Loftus Road.
