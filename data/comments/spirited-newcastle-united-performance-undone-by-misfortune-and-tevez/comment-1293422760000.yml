  Yeah, his stats look better than they are. Unlike Berbatov, Carroll has done
  more than score goals, assists etc.


  I hope we do indeed keep him, but as you said, Ashley is unpredictable and if
  something in region of Â£20m is waved in his face, I think he would grab it.
  Here's hoping he wont!
