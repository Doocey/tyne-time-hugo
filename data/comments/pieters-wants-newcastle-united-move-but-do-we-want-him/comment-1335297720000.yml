  Of course! Personally i think santon is best on the same side as Ben Arfa
  because he likes to cut in and needs someone pacey to overlap and get a good
  cross in. All we need now is someone on the LW who has a similar ability to
  benny boy but plays with his right so we can perform the exact same. Peiters
  would overlap crossing with his left foot with the right footed winger cutting
  in, sorted! :) i would say a LB CB CAM LW is deffinatly needed to improve the
  squad in the summer. If we could get pieters douglas sigurdson and hazard i
  would be over the moon as i think we would be a match for any one with these
  players added to the squad... but lets be realistic hahaha! come on the
  magpies!!!!!!!!!!
