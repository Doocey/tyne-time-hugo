message: "I think currently we have a better squad than those 3 team mentioned Josie, plus the added experience of the Premiership on our side.\r\n\r\nWe've really got to look at teams like Wigan, West Ham, Bolton and have a squad as good as them going in to the new season, which with 2 or 3 £5m signings and a couple of frees/loans then there's no doubt about it imo. \r\n\r\nA covering LB and RB, possibly like you said about the CB/RB would be a good idea (though S. Taylor could do that and R. Taylor at a massive push) but for me we need another fast winger that can cover both wings in case one of the two we've got get injured, as our better football and attacking spirit has come with two wingers on the pitch. We've got plenty of bodies in the middle, but stand out quality isn't really there, while a 15-20 league goals striker would be an excellent addition, only one of them these days can cost you the full £15m we reportedly have to spend.\r\n\r\nShould be an interesting summer for us, I just hope were quick off the mark, get them in and settled early while sitting back and enjoying the World Cup (we shouldn't use this as an excuse not to buy as hopefully our targets are already identified and were not window shopping this WC)"
