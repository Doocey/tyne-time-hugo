message: "I think plenty will, or at his age he'd be playing there already not sent out on loan from QPR.\r\n\r\nAny half decent prem striker will have a field day (Not to mention what Rooney, Torres, Drogba, Agbonlahor, Defoe, Crouch, Bent will do to him) Colo will barely cope with the increase in quality (if he does at all) Hall stands no chance against a top 10 team.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the standard of strikers we've been up against, if you've forgotten just remember how good Ameobi has looked in this league at the other end. Hall has looked good against players not even of Ameobi quality, not a great measuring stick and we certainly need better than both of them if we want to stay up."
