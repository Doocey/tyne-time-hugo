message: "you also have to ask yourself this question...is newcatle better right now than hull city, burnley, portsmouth?\r\n\r\nPortsmouth had many players injured, and its unfortunate that they're going down, but newcastles team will be pretty good\r\nand should manage to stay at mid table/bottom level. \r\n\r\nBeing a premier league team attacts more players than being a championship team...the season is very long..theres nothing wrong with a fifth cb that can fill in as a rb in a pinch..hall has the speed to do what ridgewell does for birmingham(even though he should not be a left back)"
