message: "got to agree with Lee, he looks like a really cultured player.  He was the best player on the pitch at Bristol, until he pulled his hammy.  I think we would of got all 3 points if he had stayed on.  Looking forward to seeing him start the night.  Definite purchase in my book!\r\n\r\nI've got a ton on the toon winning tonite at 5/6.  Haway the lads!"
