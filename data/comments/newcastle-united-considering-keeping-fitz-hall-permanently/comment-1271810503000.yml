  He played well last night, and looks very composed on the ball.  His
  positional sense is not in Colo's class, but whose is?  Besides, playing with
  Colo has already improved all our defenders and One Size will be no
  exception.  I think we are in danger of underrating the lad, and given the
  fact we have hardly kept the same back 4 for two games running due to injuries
  he'd be a shrewd acquisition for half a million, maybe Â£750K at a push?  I
  don't think many current Prem attackers will get past him too often, let alone
  murder him.
