  Getting sick of all the fans supporting Barton.... he was offered a contract
  in Jan but jumped on the band waggon saying that he wouldnt sign until the
  board proved they were going to invest AC money, The board are his employers
  and as such he had no right to question them. He should just pipe down and do
  the job he is paid to do
