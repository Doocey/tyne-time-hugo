  Repay the fans ??? I don't think so !!! Scum is scum and the problem is no
  matter how much you think it is under control, it rises again to the surface
  just as Joey will again punch a player or something similar. He has no pace
  and 55k is an obsenity. Did he take a drop in prison? No. Did he sign the
  contract put in front of him a while ago? No. Loyalty or a debt of gratitude
  from Joey? Dream on. We are rebuilding and youth and flair will replace solid.
  Thanks for a good performance last season Joey but you can never repay what
  you owe this club so take your over inflated opinion of yourself and go.
