message: "On CarolHe seems happy at liverpool, didn't make noise about not wanting to go till people called him a judas( this was a bit unfair) he cost 35million. for an only slightly proven striker, it was great money. he has been off most of the rest of the season. He is also potentially another ferguson or barton, unless he cools his supposed behaviour. and could end up in the nick. deal done good im a happy man\_On \_BartonHe could have signed earlier in the season, for 2 years more and then we wouldn't be in this situation, if he was still playing I am sure the club would have wanted to sign him again in another two years. He owes newcastle but is not prepared to give, where is his loyalty when he owes itOn Houghton\_I was gutted too but when you look at his results he was losing to the teams he should have beaten, and yes he got results against the teams that we shouldn't have one i was delighted\_but where is the consistency. what would have been the results without CarolOn AshleyA shrewd business man, he has a club that has no debt, he is buying young and the team looks a million miles from the one that went down two years ago. He is investing in the training facilities, the club. and we are going forward. the fans are backing him except for a few moanersOn CabayeLooking forward to seeing what you can do, welcome to the Toon if your coming.On future playerswe have one of the best scouting systems in all the clubs i am sure we will get quality that will improve."
