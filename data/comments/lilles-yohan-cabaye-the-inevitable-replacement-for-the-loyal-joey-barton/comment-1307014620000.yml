  This is a bit rich. Poor old Joey. Bless his cotton socks. The man refused to
  take a pay cut while he was in jail and when he came out, continued to conduct
  himself badly. Don't get me wrong, he's been quality this season, and, against
  my better judgement, I'd like to keep him on, but please, please stop with all
  of this "loyal" Joey business. There isn't a team who would have taken him
  after we went down, because he was a liability offering little on the pitch.
  There are few fans wouldn't have been glad to see the back of him when we went
  down. One good season does not make a player bigger than the club. Stop yer
  whinging lass.
