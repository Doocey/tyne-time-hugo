  Obviously that was a joke David if you've any sense of humour at all.

  I'm pretty sure we've scored 44 goals Graham, most of them stats sites
  indicate otherwise, but I don't think they've counted them all.


  It's no lie to say we aren't playing too well away from home and that was the
  point of the article. There isn't a huge amount of news to report on at the
  minute regards Newcastle.
