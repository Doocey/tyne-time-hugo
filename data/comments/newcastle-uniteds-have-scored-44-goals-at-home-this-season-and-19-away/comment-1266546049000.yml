message: "I have checked NUFC's official website and 'done the maths' to find the stats are:\r\n\r\nWe have scored a total of 62 goals so far (post Coventry match)\r\nAt home we have scored a total of 41 goals,\r\nand away we have scored a total of 21 goals.\r\n\r\nIn the league, we have scored a total of 53 goals.\r\n34 of these have been scored at home, with\r\n19 being scored away.\r\n\r\nDoocey....I would like to think that you were talking of the 3 games prior to the Coventry game, and that your maths should have been on an average of those 3 games (not 2 as stated) which would then give an average of 3 goals scored per game."
