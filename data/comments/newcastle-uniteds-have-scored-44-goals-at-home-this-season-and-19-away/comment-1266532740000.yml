message: "That was the worst, most pointless article ever. For starters, the first paragraph makes no sense? we've won out last 2 games 5-1 and 4-1, so your \"fantastic mathematical brain\" cocked that one up, genius!\r\n\r\nAnd who cares about the last few games, every team has a blip, and if this is ours we've lost 1 game in about 19.\r\nFact is we're grinding out our away games out and making St James' a fortress. \r\nYou can't expect us to batter every single team home AND away"
