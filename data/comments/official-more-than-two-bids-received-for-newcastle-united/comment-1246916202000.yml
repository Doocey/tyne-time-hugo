message: "Yeah this crud has really got to me, I've bearly posted anywhere here, NUFCBlog BBC or anything. There is gonna be a huge problem of changing out players. As the new one's coming in getting time to gel and any out going players accepting contracts from other clubs for less coin. Players hold just about every card in the pack. If they want to leave they go on strike or force a move. If they wish to stay for the money they refuse to accept any contract offered to them we are almost in a lose lose situation. Sorry slightly off topic.\r\n\r\nHopefully  hear something in the very near future and push through with a new manager and then sort out the playing staff. As we are already weeks behind everyone else."
