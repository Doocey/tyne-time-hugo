  Absolutely spot on 'bout Friday's game. With WBA winning and Forest being in a
  good form of late this game could have massive mental value to the squad more
  than 3 points...we have been playing pretty poor(nicest way I could put it)
  lately and the win would be massive for the players and the Toon Army. Here is
  hoping for a good win...Howay The Lads!!!
