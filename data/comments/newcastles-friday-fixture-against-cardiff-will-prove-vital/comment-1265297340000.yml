message: "This is going to be a seriously tough match.  BUT although our new team needs time to gel, there's no doubt that our attacking options have been bolstered hugely.\r\n\r\nIf Jonas is back in, with Routledge on the left, (hopefully) Guthrie in the middle where he's best, perhaps Best given a crack up front and even van Arnie pinging 'em in from LB, I think we'll score goals now.\r\n\r\nI think we'll need to, though - they're not exactly short of goals themselves."
