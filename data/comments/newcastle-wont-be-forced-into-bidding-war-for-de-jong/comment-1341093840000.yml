  Just mind games I reckon. As a club without a huge reputation I think they'd
  be more than happy to take 12 million euros in cash for him, just trying to
  see how far they can push us. Wouldn't surprise me at all if they agree that
  deal in the next few days, can't see McClaren having much of a say in it if
  the chairman's happy with that much for him.
