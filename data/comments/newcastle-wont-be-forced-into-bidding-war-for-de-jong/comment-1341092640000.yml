  Getting a striker at NUFC this summer is pretty important. We will lose Ba and
  Cisse to the ACN and will be left with Ameobi which is not good enough for a
  club fighting on 4 fronts. We have already lost Lovenkrands, Smith, Guthrie
  AND we may lose Simpson and Ranger. None of them players are top quality but
  we are weaker then last season in terms of depth. Getting in the players we
  are linked with is pretty important.
