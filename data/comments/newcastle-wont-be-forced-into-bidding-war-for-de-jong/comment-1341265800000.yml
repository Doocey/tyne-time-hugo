  They should buy him..............I think he can be the best young striker in
  europe........ 15 million is slightly over the limit for newcastle utd. but
  they now need to spend a bit more to get these kind of players....papiss demba
  cisse was a cheap buy but these kind of sale happen very limitedly. So i say
  buy him.........look how newcastle will be Cisse, De Jong, Ben Arfa,
  Cabaye.............they will definitely be contendors for the
  title...............
