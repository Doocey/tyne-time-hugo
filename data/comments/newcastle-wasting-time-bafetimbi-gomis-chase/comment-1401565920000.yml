  I completely agree, I was excited when I read about this last year, since I
  assumed he's a regular scorer who would come over for cheap. Now he's asking
  for 100k a week in wages, that is top quality player wages, not a average
  player with no outstanding qualities who's pretty much coming to towards his
  decline. Management needs to understand that to compete at all we need to
  splash the cash on 1 top quality forward, and can bring in other cheap ones
  for back up. Then we'll be able to compete (if we can get Cabella or Grenier
  over the line, or both) I think we have a good team, with a bit of good talent
  coming through, but my god just spend over Â£10m on a player once. For fuck
  sake.
