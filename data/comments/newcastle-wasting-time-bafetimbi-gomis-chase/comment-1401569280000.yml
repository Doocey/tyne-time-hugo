  I'm with you on that. I think the time has come and passed for Gomis to have
  been a Newcastle United player.


  3 or 4 years ago I would have been excited at the prospect, but now I'm also
  worried that we're chasing a 28 year-old and - reportedly - considering
  handing him big wages. Mind you, this is NUFC we're talking about, so such
  mentioned wages (Â£100k) could be way off the mark.



  I do hope we go out and sign a high-quality forward though - we're certainly
  due one.
