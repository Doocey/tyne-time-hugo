  Well if we believe any of the rubbish thats been printed ( and there's
  certainly been some ) tomorrow is D Day ( Deposit Day )and if nobody comes up
  with the money well we all know what that means the Fat Man stays and Dreary O
  Leary will probably be our manager what a bloody great prospect that is or
  maybe Barry Moat may hand Big Al a belated birthday present ( he's 39 today
  )me and every true NUFC fan hope its the latter surely he couldnt do a worse
  job than the Fat Man could he?
