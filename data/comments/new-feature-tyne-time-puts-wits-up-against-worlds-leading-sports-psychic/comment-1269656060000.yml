  Hayley Tamaddon is my favourite because she's passionate about  dancing, and 
  she once appeared on Celebrity Stars In Their Eyes, singing  the Lulu classic
  Shout. She's also starred in  many musicals, including  the fantastic Grease,
  Boogie Nights, The Rocky Horror Show and  the Abba-tastic Mamma Mia!
