  "Skysports.com understands Newcastle are prepared to sell Joey Barton......"


  What years as a football fan has taught me skysports.com understands is as
  useless as saying "news of the world understands". 


  Dont beleive it until its on proper sky sports news. Skysports.com understood
  Otmar Hitzfeld was coming in to replace bobby robson. 


  Scotty PArker is rated at Â£15million, so should be Joey Barton!
