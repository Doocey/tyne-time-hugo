message: "Let's hope the results go for us again this weekend and that would set up a great match on Monday.\r\n\r\nI've got a ticket for the game and can't wait. The best game I've been to at sjp was vs juventus in champions league when we won 1-0. Good times, but I'm hoping the game on Monday can give me as much joy as that game did.\r\n\r\nPs I had a dream that gutierrez scores his furst toon goal on Monday,  Let's hope my dream comes true."
