message: "He must be a good centre-half if he's GC's no.1 choice, but I'm sure I read somewhere that he sees Newcastle as a stepping stone and also he wants to gain Dutch citizenship and needs to stay in Holland until September 1st to gain it. So if we do sign him I hope he is loyal to the cause and wants to help improve the ambition of the squad, not just to show off his talents in the best league in the world then want to move onto a bigger club the next season.\_"
