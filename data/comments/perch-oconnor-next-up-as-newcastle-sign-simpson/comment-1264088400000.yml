message: "At least it's a start, and from what I read Danny is the right sort of character for us - i.e. not a tool.\r\n\r\nThere are still those calling for Prem-quality players, but we just don't want them right now.  Get to the end of the season and then buy players for the situation you have - prem or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see Geremi go, and if he wasn't crocked as usual, Barton.  Just because he's Barton.  I'd like to see a 'proper' right-winger to give us some balance, as we've been sussed now as one-sided.  Another left winger would be nice, as we have no cover here.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I'm really not expecting or hoping for much this window.  I'd rather save the dosh and get loaners in if anyone gets crocked."
