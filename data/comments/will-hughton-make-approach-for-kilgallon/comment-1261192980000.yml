message: "Why would we sell Coloccini now?\r\n\r\nHe has been part of the reason everything is going so well for us. Team harmony is at it's highest right now, and selling players like Collo would damage that. He, Enrique and Gutierezz have formed a brothers like bond and we need to vitally keep them happy.\r\n\r\nWhen promoted, we should then look at maybe selling Gutierezz and Coloccini as they have proven not to be Premier League quality. Until then, keep the things as they are and get a couple more players in on loan till the end of season.\r\n\r\nJanuary:\r\n\r\nBuy Danny Simpson from Manchester United.\r\n\r\nExtend loan deal for Marlon Harewood from Aston Villa till end of season.\r\n\r\nBuy Matt Kilgallon from Sheffield United.\r\n\r\nLook at getting in Tom Cleverley on loan from Manchester United from Watford till the end of the year.\r\n\r\nGet Nicky Shorey on loan from Aston Villa for cover for The Bull.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the end of season, look at buying Tom Cleverley from Manchester United. Also if Boro stay down (which looks likely) look to buy Adam Johnson. Cleverley and Johnson are young wingers that could perform in the Premier League. We need some good wingers and these two would fit in with our budget and make us a better team in the Premier League. Send Harewood and Shorey back to Villa. If West Ham go down (which looks likely) look to but Carlton Cole to have as a strike partner with Andy Carroll.\r\n\r\nHARPER\r\nSIMPSON TAYLOR KILGALLON ENRIQUE\r\nCLEVERLEY SMITH NOLAN JOHNSON\r\nCARROLL COLE\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that team is good enough for safety in the Premier League while we get in more funds and hopefully a new owner with more ambition and generosity. Two young attack minded wingers to supply a front two who will cause havoc with defences. Also the best performed defence (who thought we would ever say that after last season)with more time together looks good."
