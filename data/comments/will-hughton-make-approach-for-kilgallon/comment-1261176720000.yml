message: "He Kilgallon and his agent are in a position of power where he could go for a not too high fee and decent personal demands or wait untill summer and go for free upping the personal terms.\r\nIt could become a bidding war if he goes @ Christmas, with PL clubs competing with the Toon.\r\nEither way there`s no guarrantees for the Toon."
