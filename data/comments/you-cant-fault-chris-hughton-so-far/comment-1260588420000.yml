  Neill, your comments are a disgrace. Hughton assessed the situation well and
  has worked within his means to put together a side that won't give much away
  because he knows that in the Championship teams need 5 or 6 chances to score 1
  most of the time, whereas we only need 1 or 2 to score. We are premiership
  quality and we are playing to our strengths. It's all too easy to say, "this
  team is too good for this league, he is still a rubbish manager". You don't
  have to delve to deep into history to see good squads playing poorly and
  losing to teams far inferior to them...In fact, you only have to look at us
  over the last few years. As Ed Harrison said, Hughton will never get the
  credit he deserves and never get the full backing of the Toon Army. For this
  reason i hope he gets us up, is sacked unfairly, hired to manage a team with
  fans who have patience, and then goes on to prove every critic wrong. Make no
  mistake, i do not see Hughton as the black Lippi, but he has got a bunch of
  misfits together and turned them from a thoroughly in-balanced side into a
  hard working, hard to beat side full of confidence. Now we just need to
  compliment and suppliment our squad with a few silky, classy players (maybe 3
  or 4) and we will have a squad superior to half of the teams currently in the
  prem.
