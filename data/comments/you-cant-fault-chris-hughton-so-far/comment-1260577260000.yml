message: "I couldn't care less if we've been hopeless in some matches this season - we've won the last 7 on the trot - and won 5 of our 6  games in August to get off to  a great start for the season. And we have won most of those games through grit and  determination - something we didn't have too much of last season.\r\nIf this had been Alan Shearer he would have been the greatest manager since Kevin Keegan and Bobby Robson.\r\n7 wins on the trot and we still have people complaining - but I guess that's life - they'll still be complaining if we win 15 on the trot - but maybe they are the same ones who forecast relegation this season.\r\nMy tip to Newcastle fans - be happy - we are winning - and it's a lot better than losing."
