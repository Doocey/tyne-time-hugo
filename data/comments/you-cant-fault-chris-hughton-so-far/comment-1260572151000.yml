message: "Yeah, surprising how a run of wins will soothe the savage beast, that can be the average NUFC fan.\r\nThe present situation has the fans in a good frame of mind and past prejudices against Houghton (cockney- ex Spurs, MA yes man) seem to have been put aside.\r\nHowever we are all well aware you are only as good as your last game and following a couple of losses the old animosities would soon surface."
