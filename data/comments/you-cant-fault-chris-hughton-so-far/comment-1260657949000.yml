message: "Taunton  Toon\r\nCan you be a bit more explicit in your accusation of Ashley being a disruptive influence.?\r\n\r\nNeil\r\nTend to agree, too good for the second tier (where we will still probably lose a few) and not good enough for the PL.\r\nHowever with as few as perhaps four or five decent signings we could be competitive, not as a top tier team but as survivors.\r\nAnd it`s easier to progress as a PL team over time, due to the funds earned there as opposed to the second tier, making it important to earn promotion at the first attempt."
