message: "He has certainly steadied the sinking ship and long may it continue.\r\n\r\nIt is however difficult to look ahead because there seems to be no long term plans and the club seem to be winging it a bit imo and ofcourse we still have an owner and MD who openly admit to telling lies to one and all and will he come up with the dosh if we are promoted or will it be another season of struggle in the prem to look forward to?\r\n\r\nI really hope we don't ever have another season in the prem like the either of the last two.\r\n\r\nAnother win tomorrow wouldd be a nice birthday present for the boss though :)"
