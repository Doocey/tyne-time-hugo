message: "Dragonera - I'm afraid I don't agree that we are \"premiership quality\".  We’re doing well because we rely on individual quality – a great finish here from one of the front men, or a great save there from Harper.  On the balance of play over 90 minutes, we rarely dominate teams (a couple of games excepted) even though they are mediocre teams working on significantly inferior resources to us.  But with that said, I accept that the season is 46 games so there are bound to be some blips along the way.  Our great defensive record is not because Hughton has turned us into a really well-organised outfit – its because strikers in the Championship aren’t Premiership quality and we have a good keeper!  We still leak maybe 4 or 5 chances per game, which in the Premiership means 2 or 3 goals conceded.  \r\nWe have a quality squad by Championship standards, but a fairly poor one by Premiership standards.  It is possible for such a team to win promotion and then do OK in the Premiership without massive investment (I’m assuming Ashley won’t be spending much on players), for example like Stoke have recently done.  But this can only be achieved by being really well-organised and difficult to beat.  We might seem to be both of those things right now in the Championship, but put us up against Premiership opposition week in week out and I suspect that you’ll find that Hughton hasn’t got us all that well organised, and being totally honest, we’re not playing all that well.  That being the case, I think we’ll get murdered next season if Hughton is in charge.  I too hope he is sacked and we get someone with a proper pedigree as a successful and credible manager.  Ok, we’re sitting pretty at the top of the league right now, and we’re all very happy about that, but our performances are hardly setting the world alight so lets not get carried away."
