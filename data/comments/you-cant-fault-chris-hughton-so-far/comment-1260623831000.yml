  Like most fans Chris was not my first choice in the top job (no problem with
  him being no 2). That was due to a feared lack of experience no other reason
  (like was not born in Newcastle or any other illogical or worse motives).
  However, I was also one of those who saw us "doing a Leeds". Yet despite Mike
  Ashley continuing to be a disruptive influence we are top of the league and
  look to have a real chance of getting back where we belong. Credit where
  credit is due he has done everything the fans could of asked of him. As for
  the suggestion he won't attract big names. I'd like to think the days of
  attracting big names for one last big pay day are over. We will be better off
  signing talented young players who have the right motivation.
