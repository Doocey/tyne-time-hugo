  Really? Chris Hughton is an absolutely hopeless manager.  There have been many
  games where we have been absolutely rubbish, but we've been very lucky and not
  been punished by poor teams in a poor league.  The substitutions he makes are
  an absolute joke.  Ok we are doing well in the league, but so we should - in
  comparison to the other teams, we have huge resources i.e. high profile
  players that cost fortunes and are paid fortunes that the other teams just
  can't compete with.  Hughton is just a “yes man” puppet manager, with Ashley
  and Llambias pulling his strings, and this is the only reason he was given the
  job on a permanent basis.  If we get promoted, we'll be the premiership
  whipping boys unless we can attract some top players to the club - but which
  top player is going to want to come and play for Chris Hughton?
