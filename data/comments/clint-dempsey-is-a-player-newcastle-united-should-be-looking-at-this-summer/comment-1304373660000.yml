  Hi, Fulham fan here.


  Clint is a great player, who amazingly is still not rated by some Fulham fans.
  Player of the season to be sure. Nice to see him getting some recognition from
  other fans!


  I think there may be some wishful thinking on your part though as I doubt
  Clint would move up to Newcastle, not because you are not a good team, more
  that his next aims are to play champions league football. If he leaves us down
  at Fulham, he will be off to a team who regularly play in the CL.


  Nice blog though, have a good rest of season!
