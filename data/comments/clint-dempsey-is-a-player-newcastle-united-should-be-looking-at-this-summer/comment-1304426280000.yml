  London's finest? I think i know who needs the reality check. All true Toon
  fans no excactly where we stand believe me.We are a mid table side with an
  owner who has no intrest in the fans or the history of our beloved club.I have
  a lot of time for clubs like fulham and think what they achieve year in year
  out on small attendances and tight budgets has to be admired.As for Geordies
  told believe the press bull about us thinking we are a big club with a devine
  right to win something, we don't.All we want is to see a team that plays with
  some passion and god forbid maybe challanges for a cup once in a while,not
  alot to ask surely?
