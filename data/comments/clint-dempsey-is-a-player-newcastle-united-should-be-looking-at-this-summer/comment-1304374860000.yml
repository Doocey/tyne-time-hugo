  A good pro and a consistent performer, wouldn't mind seeing him in our squad.
  However to be honest it's not this type of player we're lacking at the moment:
  we're completely toothless since Andy Carroll left and can't rely on
  midfielders like Nolan to keep us up next year. We've absolutely got to get at
  least one out-and-out centre forward for next year, to play alongside
  supporting forwards such as Ameobi/Best/Ranger.
