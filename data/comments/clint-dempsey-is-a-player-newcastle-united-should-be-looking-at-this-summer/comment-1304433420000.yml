  Hi, Fulham fan here, in peace. Have always had a soft spot for Toon and have
  enjoyed my trips to Newcastle. But, don't you think you're being a little
  arrogant! Yes, Newcastle's gates dwarf Fulham's, but can't think of any
  reasons why Dempsey (or Dembele for that matter) would want to leave Fulham
  for Newcastle! They're currently playing for a much more accomplished team and
  manager...
