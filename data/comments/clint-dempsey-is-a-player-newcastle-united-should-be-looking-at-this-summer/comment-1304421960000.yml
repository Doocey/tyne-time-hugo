  Interesting comments but I'm afraid that NUFC are far too small a club these
  days, to attract the likes of Clint Dempsey from Fulham.... you don't shop at
  Harrod's when you only have Primark size pockets..... 


  I also note that you consider that it's desirable that NUFC ( being a far
  bigger club??? Now there's a can of worms to open a debate on! ), would be an
  attractive proposition, for any player of a half decent calibre, let alone
  some one as good as The Deuce!


  Why would you think any player good or not so good, would give up the
  privilege and beauty of playing at Craven Cottage? Why would they swap this
  paradise, for some industrial waste site in Newcastle. A place where the home
  fans are treated like crap ( does the seats for life 'debacle', ring any
  bells? ) and away fans, are treated even worse and herded in to the top corner
  of a cess pit, like so much cattle...


  As for Mark Hughes doing a good job,(?) for my part the jury is still out on
  that one, he inherited a side that got to the Europa Cup Final, just one short
  year ago. We should have kicked on and done much better this season. 


  Okay the injury problems, suffered as a result of some piss poor refereeing
  and industrial thuggery from the likes of Wolves/Stoke/Bolton/Blackburn have
  been a factor! But, the failure of MH, to buy/loan a suitable
  forward/attacking player(s), in the January transfer window was so short
  sighted as to be negligent, in the extreme... 


  Perhaps, one fine day, you will re-enter the realms of sanity ( after you have
  acquired a new owner! ) and get a reality check on your real place in the
  football world. At least our owner is only a Swiss/Egyptian 'eccentric', in
  the true English tradition of eccentrics... don,;t get me started on the new
  waxwork, of a weird American that has appeared at our traditional ground...
  that is a statue to far! 


  Enjoy the rest of your season and a better future, strictly not to the
  detriment of London's oldest and finest football club....
