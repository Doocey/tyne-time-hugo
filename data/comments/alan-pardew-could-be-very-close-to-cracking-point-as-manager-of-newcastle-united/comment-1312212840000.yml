message: "I think Pardew is happy to have a job and go along with it. \_If he had any scruples he would've 'done a Keegan' and said \"this is bollocks, I'm not putting up with it\". \_But no, he's constantly in the press chatting shit about player recruitment, contradicting statements he made earlier in the week and generally making himself look stupid and/or untrustworthy. \_He could have stopped all of this by keeping his cards close to his chest and conducting his business behind close doors, but instead he likes to make the big statements, giving the fans promises he can't keep. \_"
