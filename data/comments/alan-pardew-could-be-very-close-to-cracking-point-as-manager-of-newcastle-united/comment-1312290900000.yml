  Perhaps it's only fans that haven't noticed that the people whinging on
  Twitter are either angling for a new deal or agitating for a move. Why would
  Enrique wait so long after the sale of Nolan to chip in with his two penneth?


  Pardew's authority at the club clearly doesn't extend to the transfer budget,
  but it certainly sounds as though he needs to assert his authority on the
  players more. Of course, he may have done this, but the want away players
  couldn't give a hoot anyway. We're better off without Barton, and Enrique
  should either take a new contract or get out. The players are making us look
  more farcical than the board at the moment.
