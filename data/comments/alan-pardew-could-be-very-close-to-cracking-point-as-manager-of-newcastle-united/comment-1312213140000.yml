al right wing
  challenge for Joey, we need a striker and id even say we havent got a decent
  partner for Colo. Williamson is too soft and gets himself in a mess and Taylor
  still looks like an accident waiting to happen. Every player you buy cant be a
  tiote bargain, we need appropriate, quality buys to give us a chance to
  progress
