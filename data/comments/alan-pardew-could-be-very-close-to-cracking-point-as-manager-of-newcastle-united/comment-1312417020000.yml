message: "I've lost quite a lot of respect for Jose in the last 6 months or so.\nHe's on seriously good money - and there wasn't a huge array of clubs looking for his signature when we were relegated.\_If he just came out and said he wanted to leave then fair enough - but when you refuse to sit down at the table to even consider a new contract offer it leaves a lot to be desired.\_Only time will tell regards the rest though!"
