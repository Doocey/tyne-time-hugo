  Pardew aint going nowhere and he is in no position for his "patience to be
  wearing thin" He is only in this job because Ashley wants someone who will do
  as he is told, the only way we would see the back of Pardew is if Ashley
  sacked him, and if that happened I only cringe at who the next manager would
  be, because no self respecting manager worth his salt will work with Ashley
