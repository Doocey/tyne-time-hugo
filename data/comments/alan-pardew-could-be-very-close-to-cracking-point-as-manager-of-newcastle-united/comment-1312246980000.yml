  I can't see Pardew leaving, he's only got the job to pay off his gambling
  debts. The problem is he's a gutless nobody and he doesn't command the
  players' respect. Don't fine them after committing an offence, ban them from
  doing it in the first place...be a strong manager. You wouldn't last 2 seconds
  at ManUre if you said anything negative about that club....Fergie simply
  wouldn't stand for it, he's given some of the best players in the world the
  boot for discussing basic training methods. Pardew isn't a "more experienced
  manager", he's just a puppet and I'm afraid we'll have to put up with it for
  much longer...as long as we.stay in the Prem that's enough for Ashley. I can't
  criticise his willingness to balance the books but I can criticise his choices
  of manager and chairman. The only hope of us qualifying for Europe in the next
  5 years is by default when all the clubs above us are disqualified for having
  low turnover....
