  I think you are right but all this rubbish about doing business behind close
  doors is fueling the rumours from the players and making thr rift between
  manager and players wide and the all but nearly open war between the players d
  the board.

  Why oh why is it everytime as a Newcastle fan at the start of the close season
  I was full of hope and excited at what was to come. But now I just hoping we
  stay up and the seasons over. Because you know that at the next transfer
  window tiote will be off , that's if he gets his visa sorted out!!!!!!!
