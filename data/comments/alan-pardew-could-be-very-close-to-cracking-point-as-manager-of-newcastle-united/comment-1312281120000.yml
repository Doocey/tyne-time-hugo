  Ah man Dooce, they've worn you down?


  Why are we happy to accept mediocrity? What is stopping us being any kind of
  force in the transfer market? Nothing that we didn't have before as it happens
  and we were so inclined. You just need to be shrewd, ambitious and speculate a
  little.


  Can't believe you're not happy with Jose. Why is it we stuck with him and if
  doesn't work the other way. Yes, he's on good money but aside from a blip at
  the end last year, he's been one of our stand out performers for 2 and a bit
  years.


  The truth about our signing is that we must watch and wait. The worrying thing
  is that Pardew only wants one more in, while around him the squad could easily
  be weakened further. If we're such a poor force in the transfer market, how do
  you expect us just to matter of factly go and pick up the likes of Agbonlahor?
  Only those unaware of how we operate will come here. Don't be surprised if
  Tiote's 'Visa' issues are a smokescreen. Plenty of time left to move people
  on.


  I wouldn't worry about Pardew. He's irrelevant in all of this. He's like
  Mike's first lady, just here to look smart and say the right things.
