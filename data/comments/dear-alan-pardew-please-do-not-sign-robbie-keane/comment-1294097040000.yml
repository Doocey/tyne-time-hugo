  Well said, 5 million is simply to much for Keane. He is 30 years old and sits
  on the bench week in week out. Maximum we should pay is 1.5 million but then
  he would need to take a pay cut which i do not think he would do. Get Bentley,
  yes another bench warmer but we all know what he can do. He was awesome for
  Blackburn, maybe we can get him back to his best playing at SJP.
