  1.5mil for Keane. You must know nothing about football. Granted he hasn't been
  playing well for over a year, but bench warming is tough to find your rythem.
  Spurs would rather keep him than sell him for championship money.


  Bentley is a far more interesting proposition. Apart from being the slowest
  player I've even seen at Spurs, I think he has the ability to do well for you
  boys. Not sure Spurs would sell for less than 6/8mil, but if you guys offer
  that I'd hope we let him go.
