message: "i just wrote about 5 paragraphs saying who we should try and get and why but it didnt post and cant be bothered to rewrite it all. \r\n\r\nAny one of these would put a smile on my face...Beckford, Aron Gunnarson, Kilgallon (although hes injured) and Simpson and permanant. \r\n\r\nAlso we should do everything to keep Enrique as with the way he is going he is only a few seasons away from the Spainish first XI as its very rare to see a player of his physical size and power matched with his pace."
