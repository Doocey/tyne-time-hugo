  I don't think we should be debating who we want to bring in it's more a case
  of who we want to stay in January that is more important because if Ashley
  gets his way then I can see a few players moving on with the likes of Hull and
  Portsmouth sniffing around for guys like Nolan. I think Enrique will be off as
  well back to Spain or a Premiership side as he's far to good for the
  championship. Another concern would be some of the bigger teams poaching our
  youngsters as well like Vukic, Ranger and Kadar.
