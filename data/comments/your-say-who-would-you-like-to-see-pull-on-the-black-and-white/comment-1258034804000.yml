message: "Ian,\r\nI doubt Hull or Portsmouth even a league up would be able to offer Nolan the contract he is on now at SJP. Your right that players like Carroll and Ranger might be plucked away but I dont think Ashley would let them, not because of the fans, it would represent a loss of investment. Unless they bid something stupid like 5m+ of course which I doubt would happen. I dont think players like Enrique will be off in Jan but they certainly will in the summer if we're not promoted. For this reason I think if we dont go up this season we wont for years. Like boro lol"
