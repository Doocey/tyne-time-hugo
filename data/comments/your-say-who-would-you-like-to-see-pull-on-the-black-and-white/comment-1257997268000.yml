message: "This subject I find the most boring... lets get out the manager game and pick who we want however\r\n\r\nSkjelbred would imo be a good choice and someone hopefully with some skill and actually wants to play for NUFC and maybe not (just) the money! My worry would be that KK must have had a chance at signing him but went for Guthrie instead, well that's how it seemed.\r\n\r\nConsidering who owns our club I'm not gonna hold my breath for any significant signings, only loanee thats made any real impression so far has been Simpson. Only player who I'd love at Newcastle some day would be J Cole, maybe 2 years ago we might have had an outside chance of getting him, now we have no chance.... Thanks to the owner!"
