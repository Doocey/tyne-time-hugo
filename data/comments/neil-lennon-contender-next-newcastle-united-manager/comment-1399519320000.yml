  The first sensible Newcastle blog I have read, and by sensible I mean not
  anti-Celtic. Neil Lennon would be a great manager for you, but I agree with
  Jake... I doubt he would be welcome by the majority and that's pretty unfair
  for someone who actually is a very good manager.


  Don't let our transfer policy fool you(Celtics)... While we have sold on two
  or three players for vast amounts, we have signed a lot of duds over the past
  year too. It's a calculated guess and doesn't come off every time. Newcastle
  already has good scouts in place.


  you guys need to get rid of Alan Pardew... That's the first step, then you'll
  be back up challenging for Europe. He doesn't have a clue!!
