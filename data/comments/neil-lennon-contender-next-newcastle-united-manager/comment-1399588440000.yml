  Wouldn't he actually want to WIN things, though? I'm pretty sure he would. And
  he'd probably react quite badly if his best players were sold out from under
  him in the middle of a promising season.


  I think that probably rules him out right there.


  Who'll be our next manager under Ashley? I think we need to look amongst the
  spineless, toe-touching desperados looking to get back into football
  management. That's where Ashley/Charnley will be recruiting.
