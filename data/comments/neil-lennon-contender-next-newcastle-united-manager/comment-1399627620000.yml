  Disagree. Ashley is a business man, a rather good one too. His

  decision will be based on a what a good business orientated man thinks about –
  profits. You can see what’s happened at man utd this year as a good example.
  Moyes came in and stunk out the place, but he did succeed in one thing,
  damaging the brand. Man utd share prices are down as a result and the brand
  isn’t quite worth what it was the year before. In this regard, if Ashley
  really is looking for a replacement, he will be looking to someone to help
  stabilize or improve his brand, and in turn make him more profit, tactical
  nowise would be a bit further down his list unfortunately.

  Sacking pardew would cost him a payout in compo. Signing Lennon, would cost
  him another payout to celtic.  Moyes would be free, but is now damaged goods.
  Ashley has already said he’s locked into further investment at toon in terms
  of a transfer kitty, and would a good business man want to risk that
  investment with an unknown - no. In terms of pardew, he’s giving Ashley
  exactly what he wants – mid table. Buys cheap, and sells high, raking in that
  premiership money in the process. We only heard Ashley was furious when pards
  went around headbutting

  people on live TV, and in term damaging that all important brand image. The
  thought of challenging big spending spurs or everton for the last European
  spots, which arnt that lucrative anyway(Europa league that is – champs league
  spots are pre-taken every year by chels, liver, man u/c, and arse) I don’t
  think interests Ashley in the slightest – too costly, too risky, without
  suitable gains.   


  Pardew will be manager next year, if he was going to sack him, he would have
  done it already by now. Makes no business sense keeping a deadweight employee
  round. You get the replacement in asap. He’ll give him 20-30 mil to spend and
  expect to double that when he sells anyone decent he acquires in a couple of
  years, and the process repeats again. Expect nothing exciting in terms of
  moves up the league table – I just can’t understand why the cups aren’t
  priority, maybes there’s not as much prestige/money in it as I would imagine…
