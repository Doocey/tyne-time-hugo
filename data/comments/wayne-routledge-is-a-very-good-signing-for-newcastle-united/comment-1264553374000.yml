message: "This came as a surprise but I am so relieved we have signed a wide right player, it will give much needed balance to the side. If this Williamson comes in and we get a forward too, as Hughton seems determined to do, that leaves us just needing cover for full back.\r\n\r\nI am assuming young Donaldson will play tomorrow night and he will be marking Moses!!!!!!"
