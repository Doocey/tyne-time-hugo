message: "WE SHOULD NOT SELL RANGER!!! He has massive potential and I agree fully with the article.\_ It's madness to throw away the opportunity of developing an already promising young player.\_ He is so close to making it BIG that the thought of selling him sends a shiver down my spine.\_ We need to keep these sort of players and loan them out.\_ That is the only way they will develop quicker and mature without being a liability to us in terms of points and hindering his progress on the bench.
