  I'm glad I'm not the only one that sees Ranger as a diamond in the rough. He
  needs the kind of off-field counseling Joey Barton got in order to mature and
  realize his potential. Right now, I think the bar fly hanger-ons have his ear
  and he won't realize where that takes him until he can't p[ick up the bar tab
  anymore. Then he will be down and out, and the next sucker with potential will
  have come along to keep the drunks in suds.
