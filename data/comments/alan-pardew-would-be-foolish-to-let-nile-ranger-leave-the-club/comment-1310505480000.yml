  Gotta agree, weve failed him as much as hes failed himself, he should have
  been allowed to go out on loan to get some championship experience, bang some
  goals in and come back with confidence and experience.

  We didnt, we played him for 10 mins here and 5 mins there, not enough time to
  get into a game, but enough time to show his potential, never playing with a
  regular partner, but showed glimpses he was starting to read the game.

  Send him on loan for the season to huddersfield and let Clarky look after him,
  they play expansive football, quick and attacking, he will come back a better
  player and clarky will get promoted through his goals.
