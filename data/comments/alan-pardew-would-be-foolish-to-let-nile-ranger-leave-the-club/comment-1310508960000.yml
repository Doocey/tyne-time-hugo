  Agree - why sell him for such a low fee (1-2m) at this stage when we could
  easily loan him out as suggested and let him prove he can mature as both a man
  and player? I see this as a win-win: if he then can't buckle down and perform
  regularly in a championship side we know beyond any reasonable doubt we need
  to sell him on. 


  If, however, he starts realising his potential - and I too believe he has that
  - we've added at the very least an improving impact sub and valuable squad
  player short term... and maybe, just maybe, something more in the medium to
  long-term.
