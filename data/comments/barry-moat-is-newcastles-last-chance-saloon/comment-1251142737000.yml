  As i said on another post i'm not sure about Moat now if he's struggling with
  his finances now how will he be able to sustain the club ? also what's
  happened to the other 2 mysterious bidders ? all this going on off the pitch
  just goes to show what a brilliant job the lads are doing on the pitch
