  Yes, I agree. We're doing well as it, but we can do even
  <strong>better</strong> if we strengthen our squad with a few new players.

  Ashley has no footballing brain at all, and neither does Llambias. The only
  man that has any sense and that's close to the board is Keith Harris oddly
  enough. He won't be trying to sell the club for much longer but when he
  informed us on sales he did give the impression he had a fair idea of the
  game. But doesn't that just sum up how knowledgeable our hierarchy is?
