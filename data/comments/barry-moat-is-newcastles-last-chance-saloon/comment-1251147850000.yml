  We can only imagine what must be going through the players minds who full
  credit to them have got off to a brilliant start i would hate to see it all
  wasted because Ashley (refuses to spend) or Moat (cant spend) TBH a few weeks
  ago i thought the likes of Martins,Bassong,Beye etc leaving were taking the
  cowards way out but the longer this goes on in a way you can hardly blame them
  for wanting out of this nightmare
