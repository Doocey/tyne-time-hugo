  The thing with this is if Ashley stays (which looks likely)he's already said
  he wont spend anymore money on the club (i.e. no buying players)i think he'll
  believe(foolishly) that this very thin squad can gain promotion now dont get
  me wrong i'm not knocking the players and Chris Hughton's excellent effort its
  just the complete disregard to strenghthen the squad that really worries me
