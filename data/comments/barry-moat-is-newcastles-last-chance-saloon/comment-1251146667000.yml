message: "The question  I like to know is what will happen if Ashley finally got rid of some more players to reduce the wage bill then for some reason Moat bid is not accepted or failed to come up with the amount. We have wasted all those weeks and got rid of more than 10 players for nothing.\r\nAshley would still have to find a manager and re-invest more players all it will mean our tam will struggle until the next transfer window which might be too late by than.\r\n\r\nWHAT A TOTAL WASTE man we need to sell for the good of our club or we might not bother playing football."
