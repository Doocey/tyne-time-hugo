  The sad part is NUFC have put a muzzle on his mouth and we do not get the
  entertainment value the old fa.t brings. I think we would all love to hear his
  push back at agents and players, not to mention the whiplashing of the press.
  I think he is someones bizarre idea of a reality check on MA, who has stranger
  ideas about the club,
   Look, MA is not spending any money until he feels the books are where he wants them to be. Then he will have a budget &amp; tinker with it when he sees a profit to be had. His "cup winners" are on the bottom line, not on the pitch. You and I all know, his best outcome for the year will to be to finish 11th on worse goal differential. Then he can say an essentially top ten finish, but no bonus to pay the players!
