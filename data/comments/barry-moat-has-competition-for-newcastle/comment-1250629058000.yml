  No one knows Steve, apparently Ashley said goodbye to the players today and
  went off with forms that needed to be signed.

  As far as I know, Moat won't have control of the club for another week or so.

  To say Ashley has pocketed £40m is wrong. I'm no fan of Ashley as I'm sure you
  know by now but any transfer fees that have came (Given, N'Zogbia, Bassong,
  Beye, Duff) have all been used to reduce the rising overdraft. And fortunately
  our wage bill is under £50m now, from £75m earlier this year.
