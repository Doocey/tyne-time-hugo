  He's can't be tieing up paperwork for Duff's transfer because owners don't do
  that.

  And getting a 300 mile helicopter flight to supposedly sign the papers and
  launch the new kit is a little more than odd.

  Steven Taylor won't be leaving, for a while anyway. As long as he knows Barry
  Moat is in the driving seat for the takeover, meaning he'll appoint Shearer as
  manager, Taylor won't budge. Guaranteed. 


  BTW Steve, what do you think of my new design?
