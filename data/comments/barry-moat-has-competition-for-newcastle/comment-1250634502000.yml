  Yeah most players would be willing to stay and play under Shearer.

  Jonas and Coloccini could still leave, I'd like to keep Jonas because he
  causes problems down the side (although no finishing product).

  Also same with Xisco, I'd like to see him stay, he looked lively when he came
  on, on Saturday.
