  I couldn't agree more Steve.

  He should've appointed Shearer straight away after relegation and let him
  bring in players based on the received transfer fees that he would receive.
  Unfortunately for Ashley, he's too arrogant for that and by the time he's
  realised, (which I still don't think he has (fully)) then it's too late.

  Simple really, new owner, new start, Shearer as manager and let the real work
  begin with the team.
