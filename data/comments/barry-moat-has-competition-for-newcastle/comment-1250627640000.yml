  My apologies Doocey but its still not right what he's doing to the club i mean
  if you remember Alan (Shearer) said after relegation he wanted to take the
  managers job on and build a new young team based around Bassong next thing we
  know Bassong's on his bike talk about a kick in the nuts to Shearer hopefully
  Moat can get things sorted offer Alan the job (assuming he still wants it)im
  sure he will this should leave roughly a week to sign a few good players and
  get stuck in because there's a lot of work to be done an awful lot of wrongs
  need to be made right ''Howay the Lads''
