message: "Their eyes are all swollen, bloodshot and red,\r\nTheir tears all dried up, their fears turned to dread,\r\nAs their heroes looked weary, nothing more to give,\r\nA voice shouted loudly, 'who are we with?',\r\nThat flag raise up proudly for one final push,\r\nEmotion returned, like wild, euphoric rush,\r\nThe grey faded, turning into the proud black and white,\r\nAs the boys they did battle, with courage and might.\r\nThe feeling was tense with a warm sense of pride,\r\nThe boys on the pitch, they were stemming the tide,\r\nAnd in one fleeting moment, the battle was won,\r\nAll hail King Shearer, thy will be done!\r\nAnd its onwards and upwards, reaching for new goals,\r\nAs our leader he gathered strong, passionate souls,\r\nSo the future looked brighter, but we were here before,\r\nLet mistakes of the past rot deep in Geordie lore!\r\nLet mistakes of the past rot deep in Geordieeeeeee lore!!!!!!!!!"
