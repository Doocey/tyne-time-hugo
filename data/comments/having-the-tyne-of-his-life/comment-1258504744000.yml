message: "Would be wary of paying anything over £1m for him when Man U don't seem that keen to hang on to him <em>and</em> he's out of contract in the summer (I think). \r\n\r\nBut at £1m, while he's not as good as Beye, there's a lot more life left in his legs and he might just get that good over time. He's the sort of player we need to take the club forward - people who haven't yet passed their peak, have a point to prove, and ideally are likely to improve.\r\n\r\nWe've not got the money to buy big, so we need to build through decent youngsters. Unless we can persuade the Bill Gates foundation to chip in :-) After all, I think most people see us as a charity case..."
