  Nice to see a positive article on Newcastle! I think that the signings we have
  made over the past two years have been fantastic! I think Cabaye is my new
  favourite player he looks like a real class player, the playmaker that we
  needed 10x the player Barton is. The future looks really promising for us. If
  we keep up this form we should be looking towards Europe and why not.
