message: "Hope ur charity bet was more fruitful and more entertaining than the England game :)\r\n\r\nAs for Pancrate, I've no idea. Just hope whoever is talent spotting and looking for new players at SJP they know what they are doing.... any idea who's job it is now or is it just Hughton?\r\n\r\nNice to see Oba getting a couple o' goals to help Nigeria through to the world cup finals, another team to follow if Oba's playing as far as I'm concerned and a shame players of his talent had to move cos of our rubbish leadership and ultimate relegation."
