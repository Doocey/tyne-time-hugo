  Here’s a few if’s

  If Moat doesnt buy what happens then ?

  If Ashley stays what next ?

  If Stevie Taylor goes who’ll replace him ?

  If Shearer say’s no who’ll be manager ?

  Well first of all David Craig has been on Sky Sports to confirm that Newcastle
  <strong>will not</strong> be accepting any bids for Steven Taylor.

  The other matter is, the hierarchy are still in talks with 3 bidders meaning
  the discussions could go on for another week. David Craig indicated though
  that Monday could bring something worth noticing.
