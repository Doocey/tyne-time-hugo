  A very honest and compelling article. I'd have been very happy with a point
  today and we would have been lucky to get that had NUFC shown what they are
  truly capable of. As it happens, I think we were evenly matched and either
  side could have nicked it in the end.


  I'm sure you'll finish quite a way ahead of us come May and I hope it'll be
  4th for you guys and mid-table for us.
