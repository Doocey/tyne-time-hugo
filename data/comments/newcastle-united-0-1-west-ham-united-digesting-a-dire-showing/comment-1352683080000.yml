  Thanks for the comment Rob.


  West Ham were the better side today without doubt, and with Nolan leading the
  line alongside Carroll - who knows where Big Sam will finish. I'd be sure
  you'd be quite close to the top half.


  I'd take fourth in a heartbeat, but it's going to be a much sterner task this
  season.Only time will tell, best of the luck with your season :)
