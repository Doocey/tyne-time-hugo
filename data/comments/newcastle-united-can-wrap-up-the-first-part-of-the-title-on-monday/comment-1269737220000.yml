message: "I just hope we go up, champions or not, the toon need the prem, and I bet a few of the prem chairmen want the toon in there too.........better support than a lot of the prem teams, more money for them from away gates.\r\nA big crowd on monday against forest and a win, any win will do, and I will start thinking about the promised land again!!!\r\nI agree, whoever goes up (us wbrom and  A N Other) will need to strengthen, but thats obvious, no team who wants to stay in that league does not strengthen once promoted, we will see by ashleys dealings if he wants us in the prem, however, it has to be said (through gritted teeth by me) ashley has got it right this season, and i hope he continues next season in the same vein, rather than make the mistakes he made 2 seasons ago........time will tell though !!!!"
