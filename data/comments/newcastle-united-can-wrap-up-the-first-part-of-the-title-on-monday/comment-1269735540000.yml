  Haha John, I'd say it will be Brom, ourselves and Forest going up. However, I
  could see Forest messing up somewhere on the play-offs should they end up in
  them. West Brom will buy in the Premier League and have some players at the
  club already looking good for the Premier League. Dorrans, Miller so on. We
  hope to see you in the Premier League!
