message: "No chance of the toon not returning to the big time league. We have been very comfortable virtually all season and will stay unbeaten all season at SJP. I'm looking forward to Monday's game, might be tougher than people expect, Forest have got pace up front, but their run away from home recently has been shocking, they miss McKenna in the centre of the park.\r\nWhen we do get promoted, we do need some strengthening but not a radical overhall. We should mainly stick with the current crop of players as they have been wonderful this season. Harper, colo, jose, jonas, guthrie, nolan can all cut it in the prem. Carroll and lovenkrands can cause problems for prem defences and Carroll may prove to be a real handful for top defenders. @NUFCELITE i think Dorrans would be a good signing, he is creative, but doubt he would leave WBA to go to us, if he were to leave it would be to an established premiership club i believe"
