  I would dream for dorrens, but no chance, wba will be getting bids left right
  and center from team such as av , fulham, tot, basicly any one in top 10, andy
  caroll in a few seasons will be top class, however needs to sort his attitude,
  mabey swap taylor for beye? i see no way newcastle wont get back to the prem,
  i would also love to see a new striker that is a proven PL scorer, Carlton
  cole , Kevin Doyle idn some on along them lines, also ide love to see a
  midfielder with desire, jimmy bullard? Jamie O'Hara? PS see you all at
  peterbough away :)
