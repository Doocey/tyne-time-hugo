Given you fit none of those criteria and we’ve played you off the park 3 times this season '\r\n\r\nOh dear somebody bites dont they. A win at home against our youth team in the cup and two draws, oh teah your right you deserve the title mate. By the way we have a Centre Half that cost £10M, do any of your strikers cost £10M I wonder? Sour grapes my friend."
