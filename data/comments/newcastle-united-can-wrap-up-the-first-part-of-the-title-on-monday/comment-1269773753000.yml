message: "I'd much rather focus on just getting a result in the next game than think about us getting promotion or even winning the league for that matter.\r\n\r\nWhat's most important is to get promotion this season, although it would be nice to win something for a change, WBA can have the title for all I care, as long as we get promoted.\r\n\r\nDon't forget WBA will be supporting Newcastle as John W said above, they will be wanting us to beat Nottm Forest, so we will be doing them a favour if we win.\r\n\r\nI don't want to change anyone's ambitions or attitudes, I'm just saying, it will be better off if we just focus on our own game, and let everyone get on with theirs. I don't see the point in trying to prove anything to anyone else, because as soon as you start doing that you just go as low as them.\r\n\r\nArsenal fans seem to be the role models these days, probably because of Arsene Wenger's influence, but it's best to be civil towards the opponent as you can then generally gain the upper hand if you start it, although I'm sure a bit of banter is just fun anyway.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just saying. Go toon!"
