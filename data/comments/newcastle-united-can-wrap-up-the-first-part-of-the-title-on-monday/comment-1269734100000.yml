  Yes i agree there we win monday we can virtual start the party.Maybe that wba
  results weren't bad for us to day as might put the forest team under more
  pressure than us, another point for wba might have a big effect on there
  players minds maybe, only a point, but maybe a big blow for them on catching
  second now.Think the result monday which i expect us to win by at least a
  couple of goals,might really knock the stuffing out the forest team, and if
  they get beat really badly which i expect they will or rather should i say
  hope they will how  will that effect them for the playoff games.Was on the
  Forrest website other nite, noticed they had a poll going for who they would
  like to play in the playoffs.
