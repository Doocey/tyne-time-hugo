message: "Have to say as a Baggies fan it is yours to lose.Most important to me is promotion,and i think most Baggies fans hope you beat Forest on Monday, and we will be happy to follow you up in second place.\r\nI agree that Hughton deserves a lot of credit after an uneasy start,but both our teams do need a lot of strengthening for the Premiership.\r\nI'm not a fan of Billy Davies,but with the resources he has at Forest,i think they have done very well,and you could argue that there position is the biggest achievement of the top three.\r\nWe really should not mess up second from here,but history shows that we did catch Wolves a few years ago when they had a similar lead and then they lost in the play-offs.\r\nCongrats to Newcastle though,your fans deserve Premiership football and you are very close,i bet a few fans are glad that you stuck with Hughton now and didn't sack him after the start of the season!"
