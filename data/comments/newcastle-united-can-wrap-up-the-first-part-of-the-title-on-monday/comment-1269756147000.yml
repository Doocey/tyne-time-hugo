message: "'wrestle Dorrans off West Brom' ha ha ha. How? He has a five year contract and lets face it, if/when he leaves us he'll go to a big club with at least Â£10m spare and who are likely to finish above us next season. Given you fit none of those criteria and we've played you off the park 3 times this season i'm sensing you may have to 'wrestle' elsewhere.\r\n\r\nGood luck Monday and glad you think the title is all but sown up!"
