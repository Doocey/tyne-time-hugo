message: "I think we will win Monday and then we can start the preparations for the party. 13 points clear of Forest with a game in hand will be too much for them.\r\n\r\nOn next season, we need to understand there will be no big money deals. We need a proven striker for the Premier League but who can we see for the right money? Carlton Cole would be a dream for me, but we only have a chance if West Ham get relegated and even then there will be clubs that Carlton would rather go to approach him.\r\n\r\nJamie O'Hara, Tom Cleverley, Chris Eagles should all be able to get and add midfield spark which is what we need and then we need to look for a quick striker to put next to Carroll. Proven quality too. Want establish a Shearer/Bellamy like partnership, in that mould. Lovenkrands I like, but we need someone more proven to start.\r\n\r\nI think Steven Taylor will be sold after the latest controversy so defence reinforcements will be vital."
