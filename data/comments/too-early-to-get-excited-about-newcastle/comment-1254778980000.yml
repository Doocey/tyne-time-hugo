message: "Indeed I can only hope we get promoted.. I'm very anxious regarding what's happening to the club as I'm sure everyone else is.\r\n\r\nIf Ashley waits to see whether we will get promoted to sell the club or not it's surely going to damage our ability to build a squad/team/manager in such a short time, as we all know, a newcastle squad can't be built in a day.\r\n\r\nNice post.."
