  yes mate! did u read my blog on jonas! i said no wonder he looks shattered
  when he is the only player in midfield who gets back and then starts are
  attacks from the back and nolan and smith cant run back are midfield is are
  porblem thats why i have a go at houghton is he the only 1 who doesnt see it
  have u seen cleverly who is a good yound player why not sell nolan and buy him
  box to box player cool finsher. ps god help us if jonas or enrique get
  injured.
