  It's true to say that the powers are swung but I certainly hope it's not for
  long :D

  If you ask me, Kilgallon isn't a signing ye should be making. We'll see how
  good he is but I'm not entirely sure he'll cut it at the Stadium of Light.
  Only time will tell, needless to say with the right management ie Steve Bruce,
  he could come a solid back.
