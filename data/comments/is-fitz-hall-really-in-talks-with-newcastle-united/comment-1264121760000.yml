message: "Alrite me geordie muckers. Its a sign of the times and how things have changed in NE football. We are currently in a situation were we can attract players over our nearest and dearest simply because we are:\r\n\r\n\r\nA. In the Premier\r\nB. A more stable environment for a player (settled board) etc\r\nC. More money so can pay higher wages\r\n\r\nWe have spent years signing the likes of Williamson and then kidding ourselves \"hes not a bad player that lad\" yet not one other Premier club is in for him??? I have heard it all before been there and lived it before. You need rid of that Fat Cockney otherwise Houghton will continue to sign players that will do nothing in the Prem and you again will struggle. We struggle with the likes of Cana, Bent, Jones, Cattermole, Reid etc so you can see what the gap is like. Not a dig by the way its a just a fact the way things are at the moment. I am well aware things change so there will again be a power swing I am sure of that. Just hope its not for a good while yet!!! ;-)"
