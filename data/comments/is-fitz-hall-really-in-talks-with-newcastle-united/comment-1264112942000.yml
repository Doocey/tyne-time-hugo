  icedog-dont worry mate they signed supposed great signings in the summer gone-
  and look where they are-4 points from relegation-lol-is he daft or wot-not
  that im sayin we were a great option-its all about wages now and its about
  time we capped them-onward and upward on a reasonable earned wage is the
  key-that way u get the die hards who want to play for the shirt aswell as the
  money! ;-)
