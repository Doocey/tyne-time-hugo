  I would have went for Solano and Robert I know they are 34 and 35 but surely
  they could do a job in the championship for half a season at least. Both have
  good footballing brains and an eye for a pass I think they would be good
  business for free transfer and if Robert was offering us what he offered to do
  for PSG then I think it would be a good move.
