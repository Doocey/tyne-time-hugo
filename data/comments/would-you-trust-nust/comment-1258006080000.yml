  If NUST did buy the club at 2000 squiddlies a person , how do they then start
  paying the players wages ? The crowd returns once a fortnight , may not in
  themselves be sufficient , and financial backers such as adidas may have a
  touch of the seconds if they don't believe their sponsorship is financially
  secure ....
