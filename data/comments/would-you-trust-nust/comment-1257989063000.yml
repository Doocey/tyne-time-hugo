message: "OK I'm a NUST member so you may play the bias card here.  The only reason I can see the fan ownership model not working is the the fans don't want to play a part in/have an influence over the running of the club.\r\n\r\nAs far as having the cash is concerned and potentially having to run the club at a loss.  No one here actually know the true state of the clubs finances, with the exception of those that have done due diligence, I apologise but I refuse to believe another word that comes out of the Ashley camp, due to him having ripped any bond of trust between me as a supporter and himself in to tiny pieces over the course of the last few years.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do about it.  Way I see it we have three options.\r\n\r\n1. Sit around hoping some foreign money man comes in, and risk that they might be just as inept as the current lot or as dishonest as the lot before.\r\n2. Stick with Ashley's ridiculous, business ethos of 'stack em high and sell em cheap', and at potentially end up supporting a team renamed 'Fat Mike's All Stars' if he thinks it'll make him a couple of quid here and there.\r\n3. Do something about."
