  Still think its cock, unless one of the NUST brigade is worth a few quid, the
  fac is it is all day dreaming. Whilst I would not say I am a fan of Fat Mike
  or the idiots before, but this is a non starter, at least Ashley will not let
  us go bust, he is only hanging on to get some cash back, when we get in the
  prem he will sell and we will have a new man in charge that we can all moan
  about!!!! I suppose that NUST want shearer in charge as well. Now he is worth
  a few bob, haven't seen him punting his cash into it!!!!
