message: "I would love it to work and would support it if i could, but seeing as im a studnet who lives off beans on toast 1500 is a step to far :P. I just cant see the finances to support the day to day running of the club coming in even if they do get 100 million (the price would go to 100million, not 80million as Ashley recently pumped 20million into the club) or the bank for example providing an overdraft or loan to the club. Large investment companies, Newcastles elite businessman and Fat Freddy couldnt afford the asking price after viewing the clubs books, i dont wont to be negative or anything but its a very long shot. \r\n\r\nAlso who are the NUST? Who actually is in charge? Yes granted its a fan but i im sure Gordon Brown is a fan of Britain and he cocked that up. Last time i thought of the trust, they were protesting at the most inappropriate times (ie right before  crucial relegation games), putting out statements, speaking on the radio and trying to arrnage meetings with the clubs owners like they are the representitives of all of the clubs supporters and that was not the case."
