message: "Why Nust is a must?.....if they can't raise enough money to buy the club then what money they do raise could be used to buy a seat on the Board!!, this will give the fans a direct voice where it matters most whilst the Ashley regime continues... and stop silly ideas like renaming the ground.\r\n\r\nps if a Middle East consortium buys the club when back in the premiership all those that invested in Nust will double their money (...they wont be seen as gullible fools then Hah!!)"
