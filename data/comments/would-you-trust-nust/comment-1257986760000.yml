message: "we will never know if it works or not unless we try. we have nothing to loose under the present circumstances , it could be the best thing that ever happened to the club.. or the worst!(if it can get any worse!) , i take my hat off to all those who have probably grafted their bollocks off to get this off the ground , i trust nust do care about the club whether or not i trust them to run the club remains to be seen.ive signed up anyway..just wish people would get behind them and show support instead of knocking them , give em a chance eh!\r\nTHE FAT ONE MUST GO ASAP!!!!!!!"
