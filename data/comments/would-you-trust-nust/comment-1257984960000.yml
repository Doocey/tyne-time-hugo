  The idea is of a Barca style ownership scheme but what gets forgotten about
  Barca and Real Madrid is both are regularly bailed out of there enormous debts
  by local business and Governments because it suits Catalonia to have Barca at
  the top table.Madrid were bailed out of a debt to the tune of Â£150 million 10
  years ago when Banco Madrid board member Florentino Perez wrote it off.Barca
  are also funded by Catalonian Government to help sustain the success of their
  'National Team'.Newcastle City Council can barely afford to prune park bushes
  never mind write off a clubs debts.Dreamers.Thats what I think NUSC is full of
  and I am a member.Look at how much money the Arabs have spent at MAN CITY to
  make them slightly above average.With all the best will in the world we
  could'nt even do that never mind break into tyhe top four of the premier
  league.Wake up girls and boys and smell the coffee.
