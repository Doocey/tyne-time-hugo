message: "I wouldn't trust them, really.  A person can be intelligent but a lot of people are stupid.  You can argue that it would be no worse than Ashley's leadership, but Ashley has money at least.\r\n\r\nIF the NUST raises enough to buy the club, they'll never be able to afford to run the club at a loss.  As well as paying off all of our debts.\r\n\r\nAnd as for running the club like a Galactico style thing, I would not want that.  Electing a president based on false promises of transfer expenditure?  No thank you.\r\n\r\nNot only is it unrealistic but it's not ideal.  I never want to be a fan of a club that pays Â£80m a player."
