message: "Was not the fact we struggled during his absence, the reason we are presently chasing Kilgallon.\r\nI just dont get it, most fans support their clubs and players, NUFC fans are the most critical and hard to please fans I have ever come across.\r\nWhether it`s Players (And i have heard everyone at some time panned)owner, manager , scouts , trainers, etc.\r\nThey all come in for some kinda negitive shit !\r\nWhat are you all depressed and cant enjoy the relative success we are having, with perhaps new players coming in and on our way to promotion etc.\r\nPerhaps it would be better if we were half way down the table like the Smoggies and you could really vent.\r\nTell me what is it, been so long since things were good you forgot how to react in the positive ?"
