message: "Well he is never going to dominate in the air, but is a useful player, but not how we play at the moment. \r\n\r\nThe fact is Colo likes to play football, he is the sort of ball playing defender teams dream of having. Unfortunately this isnt used in our pump it up field to the big man tactic. I would like to see him in a few games in the middle of the park.\r\n\r\nI have thought he is a very good player for years, but i dont think the EPL is right for him. If we get 10 million offer from spain it would be best for both toon and colo for it to go through as he would be better in the spainish league and we could get a few solid players for that cash."
