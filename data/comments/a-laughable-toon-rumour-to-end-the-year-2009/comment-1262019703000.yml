message: "i think he has proved that he is a good defender, dosnt do a lot wrong, when you think , spain is slower than the prem, and the championship is harder than them both,,  less skill but more phyisical,,\r\nit will only be good for him , this time in a  lower league,,\r\n\r\non a second point, last year,, you can blame the defence all you like .,  but i look at our midfield,, total sh*t, no suport to the forwards, or the deffence, \r\n\r\nto be honest im not sure how we are top of the league, as i dont think we have played well at all, i would like to give some of the young players more time on the pitch, dont have to start with them,, not a fan of hairwood or lovenkrands,,  \r\n\r\nps GET BECKFORD :)"
