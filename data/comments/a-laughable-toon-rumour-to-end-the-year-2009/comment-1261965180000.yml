message: "It is not a laughable rumour. \r\n\r\nHe is a class defender top class.\r\n\r\n6 bad games out of 36 last season, his FIRST season in English football in the the fast paced premier league does not make him a bad player and a flop.\r\n\r\nHe is a top class player. If he goes WE WILL MISS HIM!\r\n\r\nThere is definitely some truth to this rumour. So you had better hope we keep a hold of him. He has been INTEGRAL to our solid defence this season. And he WILL play in the world cup this coming summer."
