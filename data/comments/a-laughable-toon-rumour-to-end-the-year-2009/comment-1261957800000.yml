  Colo will not be a miss, he should look good in this league which if honest is
  a sad sign for english football. He struggled so much at Sheff Wed with the
  ball in the air and when closed down. Please Toon fans do not forget last
  season and believe he is a good player at a decent level he is not. Although
  he is an argentinian international so is spiderman and how bad was he on
  boxing day. Would we be happy with England playing Argentina course we would
  apart from Messi. If offer comes in for colo snap their hands off.
