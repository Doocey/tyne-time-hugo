message: "Just got home and found out the reet shitty news. Can't say I didn't see it coming and that has helped cushion the blow. The match today really summed up the season as a whole. We'll just have to rise from the ashes. This could actually be a blessing in disguise and that's the way I'm going to look at it for now.\r\n\r\nWith Ed winding down NUFCblog I'm looking to you lads to carry the torch.\r\n\r\nHoway the lads!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nTripp"
