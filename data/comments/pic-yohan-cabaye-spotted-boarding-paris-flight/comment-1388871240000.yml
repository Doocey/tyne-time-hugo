  Your correct however,

  writing an article that merely contains the facts that a human was in an
  airport once but I do not even know when it was taken.

  To imply something then cover your inabilities to get a story by saying it
  could be something else entirely is just stirring it up. 

  Never mind your only doing what most journos do just not as well.
