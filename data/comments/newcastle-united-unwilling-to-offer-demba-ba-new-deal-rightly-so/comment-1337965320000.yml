  who said it was easy ? To pick up real talent requires time and ability to set
  up a knowledgeable scouting set-up as well as the cash to fund it. Even when
  you have the set up you need to watch players over a period of time to confirm
  they are genuinely talented . Oh and a legal team to check out contracts and
  release clauses .But of course we've done all that , so maybe we could unearth
  more gems!
