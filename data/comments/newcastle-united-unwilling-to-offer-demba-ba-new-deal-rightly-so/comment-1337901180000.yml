  there were several moments towards the end of the seaso, that made me worry
  about Ba's commitment to the club, mainl one being his continuous sulking
  (fair enough in some respects, always getting subbed with 30 mins to go) i'd
  worry slightly about the knock on effect of him leaving though, for Cisse.
  Hopefully it wouldn't disturb Pap's football, time will tell.

  but in the end, there's one thing we can have faith in......
