  Fair assessment, although i may  disagree on Stoke being the poorest
  footballing team in the league, sure how they play is not pretty to watch, a
  big strong  side who play route one football, much like BSA`s teams.

  However not many teams like to play against them and they are successful in
  what they do, give em a bit of credit.

  You`r right a bit of flair and recruitment of promising youngsters is the way
  to go, but survival and a slow rebuilding of the side is essential, with a
  promising start in adding both Tiote and Ben Arfa, a bit of steel and a flair
  playmaker come goal scorer.

  At present we badly lack a decent RB, regardless of what Chris say`s about
  Perch IMO

  neither he R.Taylor nor Simpson are quality players, that a replacement for
  S.Taylor who looks like he will price himself out of the side, I would suggest
  Bourgherra at Rangers.

  A Connor Wickham or a Wolfswinkel would`nt look bad up front with Carroll,
  twin towers so to speak.

  Well we can speculate all day , but the club seems to be going in the right
  direction, survival and a couple of decent additions each season will
  hopefully bring us back to being a top six side in the not too distant future.

  I cant end without saying what a great job Hughton has done, give the man a
  contract, what or who are we waiting for, don`t want M. O`N. and I don`t think
  Morinho is interested, so go with the guy who got you here!
