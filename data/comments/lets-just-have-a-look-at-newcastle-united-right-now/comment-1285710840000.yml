  Nice balanced and objective view - I completely agree that our sole aim this
  season is survival - nothing more, nothing less. In order to re-establish
  ourselves as a Premier league side we need more than one season. We need a
  medium to long-term plan, in which recruiting quality youth players definitely
  plays a key part. I'm chuffed with our focus on developing youth in recent
  times.


  Depending on injuries and form we may need Hughton's quiet confidence about
  funds being available in January to well placed. I have to say, however, that
  based on recent windows I trust him if he says this is the case. 


  Realistic expectations noted, I'm still a wee bit upset about the home loss to
  Stoke. Being 1-0 up at home against a team  in our 'mini-league' and coming
  away with nothing needs to be remedied. Nolan's comments today
  (http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/9041015.stm)
  are spot on for me - at this level 'slopiness' will be punished by all
  opponents, including a side high on graft but low on creativity such as
  Stoke. 


  Overall, I share the view we are doing well so far. Ben Arfa still needs to
  gel, Cambell has a contribution to make and Guthrie, S. Taylor and Simpson
  will give us more options when they're fit again, not to mention Gosling. 


  Here's to a good result again City.
