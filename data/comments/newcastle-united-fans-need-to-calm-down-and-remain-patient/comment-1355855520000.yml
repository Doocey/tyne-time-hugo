message: "I wouldn't necessarily agree with this.\n\nTake a look at the way we played away at home to West Ham, away to West Ham, and compare it to the way we played away at Fulham and in our most recent game: at home to City.\n\nSeemingly, common sense has kicked in a the constant longball has been ditched. We produced some great passing in both Fulham away and City away, and tactically, Ciss√© has adopted a wider role.\nEither way, QPR at home is huge for us. We need to win. If we play similar to the City game we'll walk it, I've no doubt.\_"
