  Not sure that constitutes as being fair really more a kick while he's down me
  thinks, how about analysing the situation first before recklessly cementing
  failure upon him, you see I remember him saying that he wants to win a trophy
  so I guess what comes with having a thin squad (due to the ignorance of our
  owner can hardley be put on AP shoulders) and more games because of playing in
  Europe has definitely caused prem concern but to assume relegation because its
  his way from past records is a bit childish. fans moan when he don't play a
  strong team then they moan when we do because the players are  getting injured
  and we got know cover, again not his fault and rest assured if he does get to
  invest and he shows his ability to get back to winning ways you will most
  likely never see the bigger picture and then find something else to jump on
  here and slate him for. petty ignorant tripe from another know it all.
