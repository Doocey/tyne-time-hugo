message: "\_Exactly! It is amazing how calm the fans have been this season, given the way that we are always lambasted as 'delusional.' Everyone is sticking behind the players and Pards, but something has to change. Every week we play with the same team and same tactics and the results are always the same ... abject performances. We are the only team who can consider themselves lucky to get something from a horrific Reading team. Our set pieces are disgustingly predictable and the team lacks all forms of creativity. For me, while HBA is out Marveaux has to come in, he's the only person in the squad aside from Cabs and HBA who can see a pass. I'd drop Jonas, or at the very least put him LB and move Santon to midfield cause then at least we'd have some penetration going forward. All Jonas brings to our game is diving and getting the occasional free kick out wide but our set piece inability negates any benefit that his role in the team can possibly bring. "
