  Calm down and remain patient? You make it sound like we have had a couple of
  bad games - fact is we are 17 games into the season (ie nearly half way) and
  have yet to put in what I would call a good 90 minute performance. We havent
  won away from home, we cant score from set pieces - the list of deficiencies
  in the team is endless.


  We are in December - how much longer should we have to wait to see a decent
  performance and some decent results?
