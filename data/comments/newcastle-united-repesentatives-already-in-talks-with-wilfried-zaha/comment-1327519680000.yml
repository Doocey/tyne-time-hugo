  As my cohorts have said - a few correct facts would be useful. First, Palace
  have no debt, sure, we run at a small loss each season but every club does and
  our owners are more than wealthy enough to cover that. Second - whay should
  anyone be talking to "his men" when we have him on a 5 year contract and have
  given no one permission to talk to anyone? What a load of tosh...
