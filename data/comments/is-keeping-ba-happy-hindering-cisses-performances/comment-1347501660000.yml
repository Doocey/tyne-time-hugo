  Yes, I was thinking the exact same thing - we'd switched to a 4-4-2 to keep Ba
  happy, as in theory he'd see more of the ball in a front two.


  But it does appear to be less effective than the 4-3-3 we played last season,
  although it is early days.


  Plus, I'm guessing Ba doesn't like a 4-3-3 as he has to graft more on the
  left, than Cisse has to in the centre.
