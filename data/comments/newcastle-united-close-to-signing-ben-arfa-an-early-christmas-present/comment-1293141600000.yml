  If this happens, it will be amazing for the club and the fans, don't want to
  get too excited until i hear an official club statement about us offering a
  deal to him tho. otherwise i am putting it down as mindless transfer
  speculation, e.g. Barton getting sold for Â£1.5 mil.

   Just hope he is fit to play at the end of Feb, giving him 3-4 weeks of full squad training to increase his sharpness and confidence for running at defenders again.
