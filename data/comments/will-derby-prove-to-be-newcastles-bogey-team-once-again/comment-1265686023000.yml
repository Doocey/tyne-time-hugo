message: "agreed, we need to go at them like we did Cardiff. Sadly, this being reality, i think Hughton will revert to his favoured 451 as it's an away game, which may work if he actually picks two wingers to use in it, rather than sticking Guthrie out on one of the flanks.\r\n\r\nI'd rather see us go the 442 way, with Carroll and Lovenkrands up top, but if Hughton feels he must pack midfield, i sincerely hope he does it properly with guthrie and smith in the middle, with nolan playing off carroll and jonas and routledge on the wings."
