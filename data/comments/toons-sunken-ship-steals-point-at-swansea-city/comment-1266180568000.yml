message: "How can you say we are underachieving when we are top of the league. I bet my house that if Alan Shearer were manager the headlines written would be very different.How can any of you call Hughton tactically naive when he has 40 years experience as a top coach and his team sit in top spot.I agree that yesterday was rubbish utter rubbish.However the players that were poor yesterday i.e Guthrie are not Hughtons buys. Once again the pen pushers and headline writers like you Neil are going to add un necessary pressure to the team therefore any underachieving is ultimately down to you and your kind!! We are no longer a big team and players are choosing Wigan before us, how very depressing.\r\nIf your reading Mr Hughton keep up the good work and dont let the \"best fans in football\" bring you down.\r\nP.s Well done Titus Bramble my how your thriving outside of the couldron of hate!!"
