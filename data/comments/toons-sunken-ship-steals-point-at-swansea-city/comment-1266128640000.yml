message: "Just another typically poor performance.  When we had the ball, the Swansea players closed us down quickly, forcing us to make one or two sideways passes then lump it forward and concede possession.  When they had the ball, we just sat back, giving them time and space and allowing them to play.  No surprise then that we only had about 30% possession and only one attempt on goal.  Is it just me that saw this?  Did YOU (i.e. fellow NUFC fans) see this?  How come Chris Hughton obviously DID NOT see this?  We absolutely deserved to lose this game, but again a stroke of unexpected luck spared Hughton’s blushes, and yet another abysmally poor performance will be casually overlooked.  \r\n\r\nI know that a lot of NUFC fans have been fooled into thinking Hughton is a half-decent manager – I urge all such fans to have a serious re-think.  This match was yet another example of his complete lack of tactical knowledge and lack of ability to motivate the team.  We must have resources that are 20 times that of some of the other clubs in this division.  Can anyone tell me, for example, when was the last time the Championship saw a £10m Argentina international centre half on £80k per week?  Or a winger who is the third name on the Argentina team sheet?  £6m for Enrique, £5 for Smith, £5m for Nolan etc. - all have played at the highest level and earn enormous wage packets.  Which other Championship team comes close to having these resources?  This is an absolutely huge advantage over our competitors in this league, yet under Hughton, there is just one point in it.  We really ought to be 10 or 15 points clear by now, if only we were able to play anywhere close to our potential.  \r\n\r\nOverall, another dismal, toothless performance.  No change there - I can only think of 3 games (Cardiff and Swansea at home, Ipswich away) all season that we have actually played well.  I assure you all, as long as Hughton is in charge, things will not improve.  We’re still relying on good luck to get promoted i.e. players that are individually better than their counterparts in this league, and other results going our way.  As a team, we are absolutely dreadful.  Promotion should be a certainty for a club like ours, but instead we can only hope for the best.  And if we do get promoted, well, it is as clear as clear can be that we will get absolutely torn to shreds in the Premiership.  A change of management is needed desperately."
