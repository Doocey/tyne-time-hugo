message: "We are playing ugly away from home, we all know that.  \r\n\r\nThe first half dozen games of the season, we were playing well within ourselves and looked streets ahead of the opposition.  \r\n\r\nI think the small squad, ageing players and the sheer amount of games have begun to catch up with us.  Add to this that every team we come up against is busting a gut to beat us and raising their game accordingly.\r\n\r\nAll in all I just want us to get back up and address the style of play / player situation once we get there.\r\n\r\nKilly Mag    -    A very good point and much though I hate to admit it, Ashley has kept us solvent.  I am under no illusion it is to protect his own interests too in that if he can spend as little as possible and get us back into the premiership, he can try to flog us again, but just beware of any new owners.  Portsmouth is a timely reminder to all fans, and like you, my heart goes out to them.\r\n\r\nLastly, despite the poor performances, surely as fans our only contribution is to get behind the team the best way we know how.  I shall be there on Wed and Sat (as usual) HOWAY THE LADS."
