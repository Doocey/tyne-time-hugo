message: "Marky, your grouping the financial plight of the football club and Ashley's stewardship with the football tactics or lack of from Hughton, two different subjects, personally I dont have a problem with Ashley now, \r\n\r\nbut Hughton? He's tactically naive, I cant name an instance where his tactics or a change of them during a game have given an advantage to Newcastle? He relies on Newcastle grinding out and nicking results in a poor league, we wont cut it with his philosophy in the premiership that's for sure."
