  i think the lads in the singing section need to start giving Ashley a break. 
  Look at the clip of Portsmouth,Cardiff and even West Ham now.  For all his
  mistakes, Newcastle are now spending and acheiving within their means.  I
  don't like the bloke as much as the next toon fan but we have to face
  facts...without Mike Ashley, Newcastle would be forced into administration or
  worse.  I personally feel Newcastle are in safer hands with Ashley then the
  likes of Hall, Shepherd or even Moat!  Until someone as rich as Ashley comes
  along, we need to stick with it.  I feel for the fans at Pompey, they are the
  innocent victims who face losing their club.  Can you imagine if newcastle
  were facing a winding up order?? What a fucking nightmare that would be.
