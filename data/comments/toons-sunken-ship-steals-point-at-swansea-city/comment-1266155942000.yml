message: "Neil you are talking absolute rubbish. If these players your talking about are world and premiership class how come they got us relegated from the premiership. A very average side missing a lot of players Enrique, Taylor,Barton.\r\nGuthrie,Nolan and Smith were terrible again!! Guthrie looks more and more like Geremi, slow and wasteful but a dead ball specialist apparently!!\r\nWe are top of the league and heading in the right direction with a squad of overpaid underachieving and in my opinion washed up bling boys. Hughton would not have been my first choice but remember it was always about balancing the books.\r\nWe Could be in Portsmouth or Crystal Palace's situation if the finances had not been adressed by Mike Ashley make no mistake.\r\nSo for all of you that chant Ashley out and continue to slate Hughton.\"We are the loyalist football supporters the world has ever had\"????????????"
