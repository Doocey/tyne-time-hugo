message: "Marky: \"Once again the pen pushers and headline writers like you Neil are going to add un necessary pressure to the team therefore any underachieving is ultimately down to you and your kind!!\"\r\n\r\nIsn't it a little ridiculous to say that the cause of the team playing nowhere near their potential is down to people writing occasional comments on blogs?  You don't think it is perhaps more likely to be something to do with, say, tactics or team selection or motivation or training technique?  I thinks its fairly unlikely that Hughton and the players even read my occasional posts on TyneTime, nevermind take any notice!  Although, I am flattered that you consider me a \"headline writer\"!"
