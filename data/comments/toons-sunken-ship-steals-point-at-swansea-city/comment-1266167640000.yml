message: "Marky Mag: I would say that those players got us relegated last season because they were mis-managed.  We had a squad last season that should have been more than capable of avoiding relegation (Given, Owen, Viduka, Martins, Duff, Beye etc. – lots of expensive, highly rated players, most with Champions League / international experience etc.).  Our squad was, in my opinion, better than Hull, WBA, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Blackburn, Stoke, Wigan, and Bolton, and perhaps on a par with teams like Everton, Fulham, West Ham and Portsmouth.  We should have avoided relegation easily!  Now, if we’d had two or three players who were underachieving, then perhaps you can put that down to individual players’ attitudes / loss of form etc.  But when your entire squad is underachieving, the responsibility has to lie with the management in my view.  No doubt the several changes of manager (for which I think Ashley has to take the blame) contributed to the team being poorly managed, but Hughton must take his share of the blame also.  We picked up only 1 point from the 7 games he was in charge (an average of 0.14 points per game), whereas Kinnear managed 23 points from 20 games (1.15 points per game).  I appreciate that Hughton faced difficult circumstances, but he still failed spectacularly!\r\n\r\nI take the point about having to sort the finances out and cut the wage bill.  That had to be done and I don’t think anyone would argue with that.  I just don’t get why there is a section of the fans who seem to me to be satisfied with underachievement and mediocrity.  I know there are some who will complain no matter what, and you may think I am one of those.  But I accept that we’re not going to win every single game this season then qualify for the Champions League next year.   I just want to see us doing about right for a club of our size and resources (which I think is a reasonable request), but the way we have been playing falls a long way short of that and anyone who saw yesterday’s game must surely agree."
