message: "Oh come one, FFS, we are top of the league we are in, we have played a damn sight more good games this season than we've played crap and yet \"the best fans in the country\" still moan &amp; whinge.\r\n\r\nI've seen some crap at SJP over the years, been dissappointed away from home more times than I care to remember and had so many false dawns that I hate mornings - BUT with 16 games to go we are top of the league, we still have one of the strongest defences in the country (which I would NEVER have expected to say about NUFC) and we're trimming down the lagacy of 15 years of overspending\r\n\r\nI agree that Hughton is not 1st choice, but you've gotta hand it to the man, he's taken a poisoned chalice of newly relegated NUFC and managed to confound the critics into giving us a fantastic chance of returning at the first time of asking - and I am sure he is learning all the time - mistakes made in this league won't hurt as much and should give him valuable lessons for the Premiership\r\n\r\nI would love to see us wining every game we believe we should win - but that only happens on Championship Manager &amp; FIFA10 - come end of May we will still be celebrating and when was the last time any of us can remember doing that ????"
