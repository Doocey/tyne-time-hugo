message: "Leeds bigger than Newcastle? Your having a fair dinkum laugh!\r\n\r\nHere in Australia our Newcastle supporter base is massive. Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal dwarf us but we still have some clout. Leeds had some fan spike when Viduka and Kewell played for them but like good bandwagoners most are have dropped off them when relegation hit. Not Newcastle, in fact Newcastle fans have seemed to increase since relegation here in Australia.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is Newcastle are a much bigger club than Leeds, anywhere around the world. \r\n\r\nAs for our transfers.....\r\n\r\nI like Beckford but not for Â£3m, no way known. Why not put in a tad more for Victor Moses at Crystal Palace? He will be a massive player in the future. Also why hasn't the name of Miles Addison from Derby been mentioned? Young and really has all the potential in the world. Will be a much better player than Kilgallon. Both players have massive potential to develop into good Premier League quality.\r\n\r\nWith Tamas Kadar developing nicely I have more confidence in him being a backup for us and with Barton back soon playing Nolan in a more advanced role, we don't need to overpay for players in January. I would like signings no doubt for depth and insurance to get out of this damn division, but lets not overspend now and regret it in June.\r\n\r\nAlso we need to keep investing in young talent for our academy. The one thing Ashley did well at the beginning is get in some good young talent. Nile Ranger coming through is evidence that system works. Getting Aaron Spear was a massive coup that was seriously underrated. Arsenal were into this kid big time but Dennis Wise convinced his family Newcastle was best for him. Hopefully we will see the benefit of this move in the near future. Spear is a real hotshot and I noticed is doing well in our reserves."
