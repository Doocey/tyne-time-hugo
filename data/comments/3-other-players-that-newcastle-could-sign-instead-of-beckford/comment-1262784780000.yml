message: "How come nobody seems to mention Joe Ledley?????\r\n\r\nFor me; he is twice the player Whittingham is and any cardiff fan will tell you he is the player that makes them tick; it is just whittingham's goals this season whcih are grabbing the headlines.\r\n\r\nWhat some of you may not know is that Ledley is out of contract at the end of the season; just like Beckford. If we could snap him up for 3-4 million pounds then we would have a real player on our hands!\r\n\r\nI thought Maynard was extremely poor at st. james this season when up against decent defenders; he didnt get a sniff!\r\n\r\nI'd go for Ledley, Beckford, Kilgallon and Moses.\r\n\r\nBuying those four players will save us millions in the future and i believe all four will go on and prosper in the PL in years to come.\r\n\r\nReally enjoying the blog doocey; good stuff man!"
