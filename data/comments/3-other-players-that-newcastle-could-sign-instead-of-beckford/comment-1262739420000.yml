message: "Arlreet Dooce, speculation from within? Liking it!!\r\n\r\nCan't help but think Whittingham would be snaffled from under our noses by bigger and better prospects at the minute. Maybe next season if we go up and show some promise.\r\n\r\nAye Billy Sharp knows where the goal is down at these levels but could he cut it any higher? Got me doubts.\r\n\r\nThat Maynard goal was a bit special eh? Kept watching it over and over again...\r\nAnother one who might be a gamble at a higher level, but might do a job getting us there at least."
