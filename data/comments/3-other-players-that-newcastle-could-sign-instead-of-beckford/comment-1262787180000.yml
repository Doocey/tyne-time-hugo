message: "Why are people talking about Chops for, we already know he can't score goals in th PL, he's been there before &amp; failed, why else would he still be in th fizzy!!!\r\nÂ£3m for a league 1 player is stupid, yes he can score goals but thats in League 1, not the fizzy or PL, in fact none of the players you've mentioned have any experience playing in the PL, so maybe ok for us to get up but what then, we have to sell them on again, Becks is 28, the others early 20's, you do the maths!!!"
