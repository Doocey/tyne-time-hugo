message: "I think Ledley and Boyd are the players we need to go for, theyl add depth to our middfield and strike force.\r\n\r\nLedley can provide from the left which we have lacked since the Ginola/Robert days, bringing in Ledley will be more of a benefit to Ameobi and Carrol.\r\n\r\nAs for Boyd DJG is completley right in what he is saying has got CL expierience good international goal scorer and an excellent striker in the SPL, i think hed much welcome a move to NUFC over the smoggies as i cant see them getting promoted if they lose Johnson.\r\n\r\nDefender wise extend Simpsons loan and sign him in the summer as hes a free agent, and look for another loan siging at center half, because Kadar has shown promising signs that he could be a big prospect for the future."
