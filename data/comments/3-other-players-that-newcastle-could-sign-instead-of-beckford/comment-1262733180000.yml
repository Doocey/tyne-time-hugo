message: "Personally I'd rather have Fryatt at Leicester over Sharp or Maynard!\r\n\r\nHe has scored goals in League 1 and the Championship, Hes looking great at the minute and never really gets the praise his goals deserve!\r\n\r\nWhittingham is a good call though, Cardiff do have finan'cial troubles although hes rated very highly by them, I would go him either now or even in the summer if we get promoted, He'd be great on our left side, We could alse try Jonas on the right too...See if it helps his end product :)"
