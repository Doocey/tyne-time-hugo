message: "Beckford has not signed because he wants more money. But he is a Leeds player until the end of the season and we don't need to sell him to raise the cash. Therefore as we don't need to sell him and we don't want to sell him the price has got to be right.  Furthermore as 20% of whatever we get for him will go straight to Wheldstone, why would Leeds sell him to the Toon fo 1.25m and only pocket £1m for a player who is scoring our way back to the championship where the rewards for the club will be far in excess of £1m.\r\n\r\nIf you don't what to pay its simple wait till the summer and get him for nowt."
