  I think we should be after PL players who are willing to drop down to us
  knowing we're going back up, Simpson is a prime example of a player who's
  willing to give up the chance of playing for Manc Usa, just so he can help us
  gain promotion, so is Harewood, tho I would expect him to cut his wages a bit,
  you'd be surprised at who'd come to us from the PL!!!!
