  Hi - doesn't Billy Sharp play for Doncaster Rovers on loan? He did nowt at the
  Blades, so seems to blow hot and cold a bit. He'd be a big gamble. Beckford
  looks premier league class to me, he certainly has the pace. If Beckford costs
  Â£3m, and then we manage to ship Geremi out, then that seems like good
  business.
