message: "Beckfords Nuts....as much as i dont like Ashley im impressed hes opening his cheque book for even beckford and killgallon. We should save the big bucks for next season when we (hopefully) in prem and need it!\r\n\r\nDoocey...nice article, good to see someone doing an article not replicating a news report. Whittingham is a skillful player and certainly has new potential and Cardiff are apparently in financial trouble. \r\n\r\nBilly Sharp certainly can score goals but Sheff Utd must have saw something he hasnt got for them to pay so much and hardly play him. \r\n\r\nAs fas as Maynard goes, havent seem him play but what a goal he scored and wouldnt mind some of that at St James. \r\n\r\nI am abit sceptical about Beckford as the press and Leeds fans say he needs three strikers id prefer Billy Sharp probably."
