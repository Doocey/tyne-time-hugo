  I live in Leeds and occasionally watch them as a neutral - Beckford is a big
  fish in a small pool, and it's absolutely right that he needs 4-5 chances to
  score just 1. He WILL struggle at a higher level where he'll have less time
  and space. Remember Leeds are pummelling other teams in that division and he's
  getting chances galore. Also has a big time charlie attitude. In my opinion we
  should steer clear but it looks as though Houghton is is adamant he wants him.
  If we signed any player from Leeds it should be Snodgrass, everything goes
  through him and he's got the midfield creativity we lack.
