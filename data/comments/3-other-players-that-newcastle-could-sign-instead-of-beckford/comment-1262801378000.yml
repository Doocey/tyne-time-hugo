  blackett,leeds will be in ccc next season and are bigger than newcastle,world
  wide fan base of leeds probably twice as big as newcastle so don't think they
  can come and cherry pick snoddy who is on a 4yr deal,he wouldn't be interested
  and leeds utd wouldn't,reason beckford who is out of contract in 4 months
  didn't ask for transfer when your bad manager made a few bids,I think your
  boss thought he would so offer so little.I say you have a bad manager as any
  manager should have prem players near top of ccc and you will see how bad he
  is when you lose them players.
