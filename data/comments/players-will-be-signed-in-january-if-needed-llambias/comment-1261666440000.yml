message: "Like you Doocey I find it difficult to believe that liar Lamebrain but (perhaps I am being gullible) I think this time it will be the truth.\r\n\r\nI hope Chris does manage to keep Simpson and Harewood until the end of the season, they will be valuable to us for the second half of the season.  I hope too we strengthen the squad.  \r\n\r\nWhy is Pancrate not getting more time on the pitch?  Most of our attacking comes down our left hand side and it would balance the team if we had the same down the right.  Whilst young Guthrie had a good second half on Sunday he is not the answer as he normally drifts into the middle."
