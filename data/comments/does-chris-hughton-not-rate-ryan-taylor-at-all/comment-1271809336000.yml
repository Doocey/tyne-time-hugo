  i rate the kid and feel for him, he comes on and scores, chris hughton should
  give him a few games, hes probably lacking stamina because he hasnt got many
  games under his belt. His deliveries in my oppinion are better that guthries.
  Since we have won the title i think chris might give a few other players
  starts and see how they cope
