message: "I fee ofr the lad, but I personally don't rate Ryan Taylor at all. He's a liability and, in my opinion, no better at freekicks than Guthrie. On top of that, Barton's freekick isn't terrible as a backup. I remember the game against Leicester this year, when they went down to 10men. They still managed to give Taylor the run around! It was almost as if they identified him as the weakness and cntinually attacked that side. \r\n\r\nWigan fans were chuffed to be rid of him and I've got to say, I can sort of see why. While he has managed some decent performances this year, and is versataille, and always gives 100%, he's managed to look average at very best in the championship. Not a player I'd like to take with us to the Premiership. Although he has Premiership experience, it has proven him to be weak."
