message: "I feel sorry for the lad also, but in the end of the day he's not good enough to hold down a 1st team spot.\r\n\r\nHe's too physically weak and not mentally disciplined enough to be a right back, too slow and not attack minded enough to be a winger.\r\n\r\nHe might shine in a 3-5-2 or 5 at the back playing as a wingback but again I doubt he's got the stamina to play it effectively, and would be dead with the running by the hour mark.\r\n\r\nIt leaves him in limbo, and in terms of his skills quite average at everything bar set pieces, which simply isn't enough for us to allow him to be a passenger. \r\n\r\nI do believe he needs 1st team football to help nail down a position here, but it will not come and so he needs to move on. I wish him all the best now as I cannot see him being here by the start of the new season if Hughton has his way, and rightly so imo."
