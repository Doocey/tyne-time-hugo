message: "I agree he is a decent defender and I hope he stays, but he's hardly worth the money and is overrated by most Toon fans (surprise, surprise). One thing I like about the lad is that he can play a pass and has good awareness for a CB, but he's been outmuscled and collapsed in far too many games in the past, including this season. The game against Tottenham being the most recent example. Therefore I think none of the bigger clubs would come in for him and stories of interest are just paper talk. He's already at the biggest club that would take him so I think he'll sign on eventually.\_"
