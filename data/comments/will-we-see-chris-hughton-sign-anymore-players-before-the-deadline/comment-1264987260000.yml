  I am happy with the players we have picked up so far i dont think we need to
  rush out and panick buy. If we do pick up anybody we could do worse than best

ay, yeah im a little gutted about moses, but I havent even heard of him until this week and hes obviously excellent as most of the prem were fight for his signature only for the might Wigan to win it.. We could do with another striker but if not this foward line will be enough.\r\n\r\ncarrol Lovenk\r\nRoutledge Barton Smith Jonas"
