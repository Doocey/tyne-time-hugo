  I would like to see us get one more striker and creative midfielder before the
  window shuts..think the midfielder is more necessary
  though..Skelbrejd;Cleverley or preferably Delph on loan from Villa; by the way
  whatever happen to us being interested in the likes of Naughton or Scannell or
  Shelvey? I think we have a good one of our own in Vukcic but will CH know how
  to develop him when healthy?
