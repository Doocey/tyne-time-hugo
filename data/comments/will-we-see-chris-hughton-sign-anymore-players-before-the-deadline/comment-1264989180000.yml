  get the lad best from coventry, hes like a young harewood. what we should do
  NOW is make an offer for the dutch lad currently on loan from chelsea! he
  looks a bit special, hes not gonna oust ash cole, so they might sell? in my
  opinion he is going to cost a lot of money when he gets older, and
  established, he could even play left mid if needed, get him now!!!
