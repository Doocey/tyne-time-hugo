  Blimey, how far have we fallen. Some of you are suggesting Darren Ambrose as a
  good signing. That sums up where we are at. Moses has done what he should do,
  sign for a club that will be in the Prem for a while as they have a manager
  who is progressing all the time and Wigan have a fantastic track record of
  developing and selling on, just what the lad need. We are the Toon and have
  never developed anyone. The players we are signing will help us to get out of
  this league and then we will be straight back down. We are the new West Brom
  !!! No ambition, bargain players, not a single striker who could score a few
  in the prem and some good youngsters coming through. The new West Brom. Darren
  Blood Ambrose !!! We need a general who can create and some pace up front.
