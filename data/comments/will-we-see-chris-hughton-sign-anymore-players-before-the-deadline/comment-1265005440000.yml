message: "\"a strong fast forward who has some finesse\"... so drogba? Rooney? Torres?\r\n\r\nJust fast will do for me...then again we got lovenkrands who i think really adds another dimension. At the moment our strikers arent bad, they just aren't the free scoring strikers. \r\n\r\nLeon Best or Maynard will make me happy. Someone said Dorrans...got a spare 5 million?\r\n\r\nOr we could pull something out the bag and get an unknown entity such as huselkepp.\r\n\r\nOr most likely we will get nout."
