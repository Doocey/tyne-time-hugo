  We WILL sign Leon Best today. He is up here having a medical; its already been
  talked about on sky sports news this morning. This lad is a very talented
  young striker; is quick, strong in the air and won't cost a lot because he is
  out of contract at the end of the season. I've watched him a couple of times
  this year as i know a chap who plays for coventry and in the right team he
  could be abit special (one particular goal against portsmouth this season
  showed the ability he has in his locker)...
