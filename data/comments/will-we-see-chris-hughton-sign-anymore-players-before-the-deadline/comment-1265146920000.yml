message: "Hopefully Best will be a success at The Toon, he has all the atributes Big strong pacey, good in the air, with a nose for goal.\r\nWith the right supporting cast, could be quite prolific, much happier to see him arrive than our so called first choice Beckford.\r\nJust unfortunate not to also sign Moses a guarranteed success, could have made a deadly duo,ah well!"
