message: "why are we hearing Hulse, Ambrose etc being mentioned? these players arent good enuff. Bartons back soon to add some creativity in midfield so we dont want to be stuck with duff players that wont play next season. Anyway, yeah im a little gutted about moses, but I havent even heard of him until this week and hes obviously excellent as most of the prem were fight for his signature only for the might Wigan to win it.. We could do with another striker but if not this foward line will be enough.\r\n\r\ncarrol Lovenk\r\nRoutledge Barton Smith Jonas"
