  Very disappointed with the Moses affair...2.5 million is chicken feed for a
  talent like his....He will move on for 4 or 5 times more than that.  An extra
  half a million!!! why do they continue to play these games? Of course a club
  should be frugal but they are losing out far too many times for the sake of
  the odd half a million. The team is in obvious need of some creativity in the
  middle, and with respect to the fellas in the team...they will struggle if we
  move up. We do need to strengthen with some more prospects or the team may
  well become a yo-yo side between the Premiership and the Championship
