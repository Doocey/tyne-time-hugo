  We have lost out on Moses and Beckford because the owner would not stump up a
  few extra hundred thousand. Would Moses have chosen Wigan and 15K gates ahead
  of NUFC if we had offered a bit more to match their offer? How can the owner
  be so short sighted? Because he is a knob? We may be top of the league yet we
  play football which is mind numbingly dull. Embarrassing really. Ashley has to
  go. We are on a downward spiral so long as he is at NUFC. IF we get promoted,
  we will come straight back down. The guy is a massive cloud over the club and
  his presence spreads despair.
