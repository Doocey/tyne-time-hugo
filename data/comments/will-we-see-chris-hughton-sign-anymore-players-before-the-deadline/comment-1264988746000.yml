message: "We should try to offer Nicky Butt to West Brom. additon some changes, and getting Graham Dorrans! A very well player Dorrans!\r\n\r\nI also hope hughton try to get Gary Hooper, if it goes wrong, bid higher for Beckford! We can also try to sign Van Aanholt permanently, he could be a very good back-up for Jose Enrique!"
