  Leon Best is rubbish.I dont think we will be signing ne1 else.I am gutted are
  youth policy stopped when dennis wise left.Th only thing positive from him
  were chasing after youth players and now it looks like that idea is gone down
  the pan.V moses wud have been a quality signing and is gonna be worth millions
  in a year or tw.No way they cud have made a loss on this one.Lovenkrands has
  to start up front fir his pace alone.442 formation till rest of
  season,leicester game was exactly like last season,NOT GUD ENUF!!!!
