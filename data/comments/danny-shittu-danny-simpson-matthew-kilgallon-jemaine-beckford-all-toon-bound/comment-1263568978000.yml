message: "The journal are saying that the simpson deal looks set to break down. I think if we loose our first choice right back we have missed a trick here big time. \r\n\r\nThis is not a gamble signing like Beckford, the lad has made the RB slot his own this season and looks good enough for the prem IMO. If he go's back to Man U because of the fee or wages, it is an indication that Ashley has again lied and doesn't intend to invest a penny in this squad and will try and sell to the highest bidder in the summer.\r\n\r\ni would be suprised if anyone comes in during the window apart from the usual last second loan signing to put a picture in the back of the chronicle."
