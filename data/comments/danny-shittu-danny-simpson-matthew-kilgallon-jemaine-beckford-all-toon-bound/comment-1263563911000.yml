  its the usual crap.  we aint buying anyone.  we will be weaker cum the end of
  the window.  we will lose simpson - who is not coming now as we failed to
  agree personal terms with the lad.  Harewood has gone and will not be replaced
  by anyone let alone beckford.  cum the end of the window the bottom line will
  be, we will have less players than we had before the window opnened. 
  Obviously ashley wants to see us fade away in the second half of the season, i
  will put my money on the table now and say we will miss the automatic play off
  spots and will be in the bag for the play offs only.  We could have had our
  deals done so quick this window, beckford for 2 million and simpson in on
  permenant deals and let geremi go on a free, that would still leave our wages
  in a better position.  wake up lads, its the middle of the window and nothing,
  not a shred of even a truthfull hint of anyone coming in.
