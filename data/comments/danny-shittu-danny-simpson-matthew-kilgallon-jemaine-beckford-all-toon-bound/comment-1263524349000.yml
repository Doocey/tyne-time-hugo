  Beckford wud be a HUD.  Sighning seeing as he scored against man u with the
  support of Leeds and Newcastle are a lot more creative than Leeds and put
  beckford in front of goal  and he's as cool as any other striker in the prem
  also he has speed lovencrand s and beckford  wud be the quickest partnership
  in all of the English leagues with lovencrands anouncing  last season that he
  cud run 100m in 11seconds not 2 shabby and jonas on the wing so creative and
  Enrique bags full of skill I'd be happy but I'd target a quality right
  midfielder in the summer a maybe a creative centrall midfielder may nigel reo
  coker as he is not getting a run out wif Aston villa
