  i dont know anytin bout dis fella stiljbred but i had a good laf wen i seen 4m
  next to his name.do you honestly think that fat c**t will fork out 4m on a
  player.i love newcastle but some of the lads here are dreaming thinkin we're
  going to sign this fella or that fella.ever since ashley arrived at evry
  transfer window we'd hear we're buyin 5 players and then end up getn 1 maybe 2
  on loan.its so frustrating.the sooner this window is over the better.sick of
  them filling us with crap and giving us false hope.role on feb 1st.and lets
  get on with goin up as champions with a trophy to put in our dusty cabinet.
