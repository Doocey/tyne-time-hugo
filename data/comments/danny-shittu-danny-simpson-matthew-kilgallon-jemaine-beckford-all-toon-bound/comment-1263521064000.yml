message: "Great effort by Peter last night and he will have helped to tilt the transfer of Jermaine Beckford our way. Maybe we don't need Beckford after all, if Peter can stay fit and show us the form of last night. He's  a natural predator - like Michael Owen was - note the past tense on that one. But as a number of reports said this morning Peter has never let the side down when he's been given his chance - and he should be delighted at his scoring prowess last night - long may it continue.\r\nWatch for Leeds to try to make a deal at 1.5M with Newcastle for Jermaine but I have doubts aboyut the ald's character and temperament - the last thing we want is some prima donna in the squad - we've had our fill of those.\r\nI still think Kilgallon will end up at Everton in the summer and would be surprised if he's transferred in January - but we'll see - anything seems possible in football these days."
