  I hope at least the simpson deal will be done and shittu brought in on loan .
  That way we are at least covered enough defence wise ,i would rather kilgallon
  in ahead of shittu but the news reports seem to have him going to Everton in
  the summer . As for Beckford no thanks after lovenkrands display against
  plymouth ,why should we ? we would be beter going for a creative midfielder or
  a younger striker . After all beckford is 26 and has not played above the 1st
  division its not like he is a promising young talent just starting out .
