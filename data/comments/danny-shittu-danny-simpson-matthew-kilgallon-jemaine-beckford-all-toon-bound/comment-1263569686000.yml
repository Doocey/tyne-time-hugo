  Seriously, you're saying jermaine beckford is the difference between running
  away with this league and only get in the play-offs, well him and simpson. We
  have some VERY good young'uns who could easily hold their own in the fizzy pop
  league, harewood was a donkey and kizvan whatever his name was wont be a miss
  and at least it will give Kadar, Ranger, Ngo Baheng, Morris, Donaldson, Tozer,
  Danquah etc a chance. Stuff loan signings these lads would walk across fire to
  get first team footy. As for Ashley wanting to see us fade away, well that
  would be a clever buisness decision would'nt it.
