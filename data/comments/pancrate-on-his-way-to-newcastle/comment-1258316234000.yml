message: "It looks like he wants to come to Newcastle - which is good - and we need speed and wingers - so that's good too.\r\nIt looks like Chris has little money to spend - so he will have to do things wisely (excuse the pun) - but Hughton seems a good wheeler and dealer from what we've seen - so I still have high hopes of getting say 4 new players in before the end of January and this guy may be signed next week - that would be a decent start. He's not great but it's good he's been on trial for 3 days so Chris knows he can add to the squad. We need to ensure squad is big enough through May - and cross our fingers on the injury front - but we can definitely get promoted - definitely - and that should be our number one aim - not protesting against Ashley."
