  I think it probably comes down to the exposure more than anything. All those
  televised games from St. James' Park where Sports Direct adverts take up the
  majority of the stadium = priceless advertising on a regular basis. 



  Inevitably, the club is an advertising vessel for him, which makes me feel ill
  every time I see one those signs around the stadium.



  That's my two cents anyway.
