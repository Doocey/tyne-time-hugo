  Agreed â€” it's not all bad under MA's ownership, there has been a lot of
  improvements in different parts of the club, but he's a couple of embers of
  ambition away from being a quality owner.



  We do need to strengthen for sure, but it's been a familiar tale since our
  return to the Premier League in my opinion.



  Thanks for reading.
