message: "WBA now 1-1, but surprised you don't mention Brian Clough's old team Forest who are leading against Cov. They are the form team. And Brian, BTW is dead, I think you mean his son Nigel.\r\n\r\nHope that Butt, who you mention, won't be looking for those incisive passes for Shola as we'd be waiting a very long time. Fingers crossed Smith will be back.\r\n\r\nCome on Toon!"
