  Another poor poor performance to end a dismal Christmas..

  No creative influence and I will be pleased to see the back of Harewood's head
  (if he leaves!).I think new players in January are badly needed or else Wba
  will no doubt pip us to the post.

  Players with real flair such as Jermaine Beckford(League 1's best player by a
  mile,George Boyd(did very little again today for a struggling posh) and
  players with experience such as southamption's Rickie lambert or Norwichs
  Grant Holt who are really shinning in League 1,and Premier league misfits such
  as Damian Plessis and Andriey Voronin from Liverpool both available cheaply,
  as would be Hull's Giovanni and Nick Barmby.

  I believe these players would help us secure a steely future in the Premier
  League,for the team I fell in love with nealy 20 years ago.. :)
