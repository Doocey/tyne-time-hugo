  TBH Doocey i cant see us getting Alan Shearer now as each day comes it seems
  more likely that Ashley will be staying and he (Ashley) seems to have frozen
  Alan completley out of the club i dont think there'll be a big crowd tonight
  against Huddersfield my fear now isn't the result but the chance of picking up
  injuries as i think Huddersfield will be pileing in to tackles with nothing to
  lose and everything to gain i just hope the squad comes through unscathed
  ready for Monday nights game against Leicester
