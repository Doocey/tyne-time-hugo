  Jonas' strength has always his work rate and his ability to help the fullback,
  I'm sure Santon and Raylor from last season and Enrique before that would be
  of the same opinion, he always allows the fullback to attack, of late Santon
  has been getting quite a bit of bad press due to being caught out of position,
  is it Santons fault or is it that Jonas is not as effective as he was, for me
  Jonas has had his day, if Maveaux is to take his plave in the side then Santon
  will have to improve his defending
