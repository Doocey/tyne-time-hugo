  Gutierrez has offered us nothing this season in my opinion. Every time i watch
  games, he just hasnt done anything. Marveaux for me, should be ahead of jonas.
  We have to play more attacking talent as ours are injured and thinking jonas
  will help it, he wont! I honestly think we play him because hes beleived to be
  a 'fan favourite'. By seeing fans on facebook pages, they all want him off the
  pitch. Hes contributed nothing, nor defensively aswell, hes shit, get rid of
  him, keep marveuax....just to say, my opinion only!
