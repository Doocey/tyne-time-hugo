  Well said he is a ok manager but at this level with a team as good as ours it
  would be hard to get it wrong I love peter lovenkrands but it's sad he is to
  old to be as prolific as big al because I think if he was about 25-26 then wow
  he'd have no9 easy I hope that mauling will give andy the confodance to push
  on and be great fingers crossed ehh:-)
