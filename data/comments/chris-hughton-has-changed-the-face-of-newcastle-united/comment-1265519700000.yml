  though im not an ashley fan i feel newcastle have a much better team now
  without' the high class mercenarys on high wages that were only at the club
  for the money.the team has strength in depth now and is on the march back to
  the big time.least we aint had 4 owners in the same season like pompey fans
  have to put up with.So its about time every 1 stoped moaning and got behind
  the team onwards and upwards.
