message: "Glad to see CH getting the praise he truly deserves.\r\nLet's not forget, when this season started the club was in free fall. Big players were jumping off the sinking ship like rats and we were being tipped by many to be relegation candidates come the end of the season. The best thing he’s done is get rid of all the headline grabbing egos out the door (this includes some previous managers also) and what we now seem to have is a group of honest hardworking pros who’ll do their best for the club."
