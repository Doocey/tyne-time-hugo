message: "You`re right Doocey, cant be denied, the facts speak for themselves.\r\nGuy was handed a basketcase club in chaos, given nothing in the way of dosh and came out with a united side who are running away with the league.\r\nNow if Hiddink were to show interest in managing the side, I might have pause for thought, but I honestly can`t think of anyone else who i would trade for Hughton.\r\nThe problem`s with this club has more to do with managers than anythig else (and the fans demands for constant change)too many managers, too many different approaches, resulting in an unsettled dressing room, ergo a  confused team that does`nt respond with any enthusiasm, we saw that during the final quarter of last season.\r\nOn another note, we may be enjoying the company of Mr. Ashley for a while longer, noticed a return to an early practice of stocking the youth side, having brought in a young Viking from The Faroes, not something an owner interested in selling would do.\r\nThere`s going to be quite an increase in The EPL`s tv. revenue next season grossing over one billion pounds, which amounts to each PL  member club receiving fifty million apiece, nice piece of change and certainly an incentive for owners or perspective owners.\r\nWhy the recent takeovers by interests as varied as The US, The Gulf States and East Asia, it`s about the money, plus the show business aspect of owning a PL club.\r\nAn appealing business, whose earnings are expected to increase at a rapid pace over time.\r\nSo, Could be Mr.Ashleys United for the foreseeable future !"
