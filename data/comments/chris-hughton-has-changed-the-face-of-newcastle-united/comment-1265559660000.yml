  I just hope he will keep the same tactics from now on. We should be where we
  are with the team we have. We might have even had more points if we had played
  a more attacking formation earlier in the season. I'm still not convinced that
  Hughton is the right man to do the job in the premier league however I would
  still give him the chance when we get promoted.
