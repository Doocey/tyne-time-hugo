  Not entirely sure how you think Colback was superior to any Newcastle player
  last season, but at least we agree that Anita is good ?

 His job is to link the defence and midfield - collect the ball from Coloccini
  and then either play it out to the wings, or through the middle for our CM's
  to take charge.



  Anita is a very smart player in that he can drag players into his space,
  before spotting a pass that will open up gaps for our midfield to exploit.



  You're spot on re: Sissoko though - the man is a box to box midfielder through
  and through, no matter whether Deschamps/Pardew played him on the wings.



  Thanks for reading.
