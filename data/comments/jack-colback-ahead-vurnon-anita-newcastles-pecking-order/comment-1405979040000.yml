 creatively. He's not
  a holding player for me either, all he does is ineffectively screen the
  defence, pacing backwards without every putting a leg in to stop the
  opposition's build-up play or running 10 - 15 yards behind the counter attack
  as he doesn't have the pace to get back on the right side of the defence. In
  his entire time a NUFC he's only played 10mins of football at an acceptable
  level (home to Chelsea) &amp; that's it &amp; he's been complete garbage the
  rest of the time. 



  Colback for me should take his position for the upcoming season but I'm hoping
  the club will sign Grenier to play in that central creative position with
  Tiote as the true defensive midfielder. That would allow Sissoko, de Jong
  &amp; Cabella to provide a swift attacking threat to the lone striker.
