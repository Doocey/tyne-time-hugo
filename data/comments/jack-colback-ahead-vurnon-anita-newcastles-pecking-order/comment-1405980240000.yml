  Colback (at least last season) looked to get more involved in the attacking
  aspects of the game then did Anita. Anita undoubtedly is the more technically
  gifted player but (maybe due to lack of size or just the setup of the team)
  disappears from games once the team is in final third with the ball. And as a
  technically gifted player, he should have played a larger role moving the ball
  forward and creating after the departure of Cabaye. Something he didn't really
  do. 

  Colback, on the other hand, seems to allows get involved. Not as a creative
  force by any means, but as an option.  

  Now seeing as both are very versatile players with good engines and awareness
  both will benefit from having De Jong (and Cabella) in the team. (Anita
  probably more so). 

  Ultimately, neither of these two would make it into my starting 11 as
  Newcastle has this freak of an athlete in Sissoko, who should be playing a box
  to box role for the club. 

  But both Anita and Colback bring something a little different to the team in a
  similar role. Which will be a huge plus as it will provide Pardew with a lot
  of options when it comes time to shut up shop (we all know he'll try to) or
  link play on counter attacks.
