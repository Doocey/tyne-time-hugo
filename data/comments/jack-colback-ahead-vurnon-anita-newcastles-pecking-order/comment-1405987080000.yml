  At last somebody who fully understands Anita's inadequacies' and used my
  phrase exactly, 'like playing with 10 men'. He's a hider and a fraud,
  pretending to run about a lot whilst never getting close enough to anybody
  defensively and lacks the quality to effect the game offensively. Having
  watched him live approximately 15 times during the season prior to moving to
  Newcastle, I said the day we signed him that he was one for the Guivarch /
  Marcelino box. Choosing him over Leroy Fer is probably the biggest howler
  Graham Carr will make in his career. He'll be with us for many seasons to come
  as nobody in football can truly rate him enough to take him from us, just hope
  he doesn't start a meaningful game this season. Colback will start every game
  before Anita when fit.
