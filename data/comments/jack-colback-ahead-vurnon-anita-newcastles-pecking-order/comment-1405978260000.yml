  I'm not convinced about Anita - though glad to have him in the squad. His
  crossing is flat too - much more likely to hoof floaters than dangerously
  whipped crosses. But I'm hoping he will improve and influence games more.  I
  would probably start with both Colback and Anita on the bench...all valuable
  members of the squad though.
