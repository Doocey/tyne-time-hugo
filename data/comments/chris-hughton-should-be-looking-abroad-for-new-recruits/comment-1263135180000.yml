message: "If we are to look aborad, the first name that comes to mind is Per Ciljan Skjelbreid. Outstanding player with a moral thats suits the club. He can make a bigger name for himself in the PL than Hangeland or former Liverpool player Riise. \r\nHave both the pace, stamina and the abillty to open up the defence with clever passes. Just the type of player we need. \r\n\r\nI also would have like to see Macheda from United, he`s listed for loan. \r\nRoque Santa Cruz have just played 8 matches so far. And with Tevez, Bellamy, Robino, Adebayorand and benjai they could let him go on a loan."
