message: "O'Hara is a good player but we are abit overloaded in the midfield, especially with Barton to return as well. Would rather see Guthrie start more games then develop a Spurs youngster. \r\n\r\nI think he is available though, Pompey aren't allowed to extend his loan, a little harsh I think. \r\n\r\nWe still need to resolve the right back area! Ryan Taylor is great at dead balls but at right back he makes me take a big breath in every time the ball goes near him and there has been no news on Simpson yet."
