  The new rulings mean that you have to have a high percentage of your first
  team match day squad trained in England (for the previous four years if they
  have not came through the ranks) so yes, signing lots of foreigners who
  wouldn't be interested makes sense. You will be best off waiting till the end
  of the season allowing them to bed in and see how they do in the World Cup
  first! Gui'varch anyone?
