message: "If we get promoted we should do everything to sign Sessegnon from PSG. Top top class player and cant beleive hes not at a real top club. \r\n\r\nComing out of the dream world, im sure there is talent out there in Scandavania and Eastern Europe, but he should buy them as well as not instead of. Would rather have Killgallon and play it safe, but if we then bring in the next Hangeland as well then great :D."
