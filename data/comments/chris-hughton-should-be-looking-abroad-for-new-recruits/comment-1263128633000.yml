message: "I dont think we will have too much trouble beating Plymouth at home. Especially with Hughton saying he is gonna play pretty much a full strength squad to stop the rust setting in. \r\n\r\nAfter that I would like to see us approah the 2 West Brom games like we did the Middlesborough game. In total control and laying down our superiority. If it maintains a barren run for them and we can start another winning streak I think they will struggle to catch us and forest, they have scored for fun at times but just havent been consistent enough. It would be great if they had to try and come up through the play offs! Only first place will be good enough for us though IMO. It's so important we win a trophy. Even if it is the second divison. Then hopefully some rich arab will buy us."
