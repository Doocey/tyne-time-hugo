  I think the answer to our creative midfield problem is Per Cijan Skjelbred,
  we've been linked with him for a couple years now and I think its about time
  they take the plunge and snap him up. Could easily play at this level and at
  Premiership level as he's only 21 or 22 and has Champions League and UEFA Cup
  expericence. There's been quite a few good scandinavian imports in the past
  few years and we should gamble on him and Erik Husekelepp.
