  Surely if the owner MA truley believes like most of us toon fans hope will get
  promoted first time of asking that we should be looking at targets not just
  for now but next season and sign them on pre contracts in january to come in
  the summer. If we dont no doubt after the world cup if any of the players we
  were interested have a good cup the bigger clubs who can throw more money than
  sense will be queing up. As for a short term playmaker in midfield what about
  giles barnes was released by derby and has been training with birmingham and
  is a free agent ???
