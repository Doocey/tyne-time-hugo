message: "Sorry Craig your wrong!\r\n\r\nThere is loads of talent abroad who would jump at the chance to play for us. The fact we are in the Championship has nothing to do with it. You forget we are top and potential promotion candidates! A lot of the home grown kids are prima donna,s who just want to see how much money they can earn from us!"
