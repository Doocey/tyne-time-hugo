  I would like to see a mixture of  english and foreign. There has to be some
  talented young english players that chris can attract in our current
  situation. Also I can't believe we wouldn't be able to get Macheda on loan. He
  has played something like 6 games this season. Would be nice to here something
  about the Simpson situation. Doesn't his loan expire next week or something?
