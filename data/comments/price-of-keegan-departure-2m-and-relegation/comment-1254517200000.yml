  If you read some of the comments from the case the club admits to the tribunal
  it repeatedly &amp; deliberatley misled the press the public and the fans of
  NUFC ( just watch the crowd reaction on saturday ) the fact that Wise wanted
  Keegan to sign a guy by watching youtube and as a favour to a couple of agents
  at the end of the day Keegan was made to look the bad guy by Ashley but i
  think now that things are out in the open the fans will now understand why
  Keegan had no option but to leave and myself i'd have him back tomorrow with a
  new ownership
