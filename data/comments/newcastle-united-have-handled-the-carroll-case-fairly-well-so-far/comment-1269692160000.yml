message: "Three points against Billy Davies’ side would all but ensure we’ll be a Premier League team next season, with us only needing 4 more wins to secure definite Premier League football next term.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe don`t need to win 4 more games. \r\nIf we beat Forest on monday, we just need another 5 points.\r\nAnd that from 7 games.."
