  Yes i know just dont understand why they should go after a teammates bird.I
  would be well pissed off if i was chris all the heard work he has put in
  trying to get nufc all the right headlines on the pitch.Was not impressed with
  chris when he       first got the job,but he has certainly won me over,watch
  him on the interviews, looks to me hes bursting with pride being the newcastle
  boss
