message: "Phil - technically 6 points even if we beat them, in case Forest  win all theirs, get to 88 points AND overhaul our goal difference. Very unlikely scenario though.\r\n Even if we draw, their maximum haul drops to 89 points so 3 victories out of our last 7 would guarantee 2nd spot if we only draw."
