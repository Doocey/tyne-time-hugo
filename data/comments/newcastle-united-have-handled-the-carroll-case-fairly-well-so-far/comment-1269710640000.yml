  The NUFC response seems to have been just to ignore that the incident ever
  took place, the aim obviously being to minimise the amount of media coverage. 
  But is this really a satisfactory response?  Is it right that a serious
  assault on a work colleague, a criminal offence, is so casually overlooked and
  seemingly goes unpunished?  Does anyone know of another workplace where this
  behaviour would be accepted with such indifference?  Is it not important to
  send out a message that this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and
  will not be tolerated within the club, regardless of whatever provocation has
  gone on?  Is it not important that Andy Carroll is forced to acknowledge that
  his pugnacity is a big problem and he can’t keep turning violent whenever the
  fancy takes him?  Or does the fact that Carroll scored a goal on Tuesday and
  the team is top of the league mean that the players have an unfettered right
  to indulge in whatever kind of behaviour they please, no matter how
  disgraceful , without consequence – just as long as the team is winning?
