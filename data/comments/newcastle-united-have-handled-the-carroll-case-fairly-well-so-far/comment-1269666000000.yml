  Yes newcastle have handled the prob well doocey.Though i was angry with carrol
  when i heard, i dont think the mags would have played Carrol if the young lad
  was at fault now.As for taylor what were you thinking man, carrol is scoring a
  goal getting us a point at swansea,and you are texting the mans girl
  friend.Take a look round town mate, plenty of lasses there,what is it with
  some players trying to get a leg over with other players ladies,gonna go a
  long way to building team spirit aint it mr taylor.See 5 of the senior squad
  went to the manager and told him to ship taylor out according to reports,that
  to me says it all mate.
