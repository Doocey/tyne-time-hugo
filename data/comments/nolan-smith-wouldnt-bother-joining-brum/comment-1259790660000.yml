message: "No offence to Newcastle but money will talk. Even if you get premoted you will still be expected to be relegated as a new prem team. No offence to newcastle but it's been a while since they have been a top flight force. Why would either Smith or Nolan realy want to stay? Please don't think they will stay out of loyalty, those days have gone. Even if Birmingham get relegated they will still have had the chance to put themselves in the shop window again.\r\n\r\nplease remember where you are (no offence)"
