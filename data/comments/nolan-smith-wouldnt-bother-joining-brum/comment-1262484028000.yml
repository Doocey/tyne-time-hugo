  would just like to reply to the part were u say we are probably going to get
  pushed into the bottom 3 and be relegated now lets not be so rash considering
  we are 8th in the prem fact , were on a unbeaten run of 11 premier league
  games fact , if blues offerd for the pair which in my opinion they wont but if
  they did im sure they would be very tempted at a chance to taste prem football
  again even IF we get relegated which i doubt very much will happen.
