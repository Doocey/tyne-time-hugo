message: "jesus wept, it's hard to decide what's more embarassing on this post, some of our own thick tosser fans hurling nonsensical abuse (that BMP pillock) or a bunch of brum fans who all of a sudden have real delusions of grandeur because for the first time in 17 years, they're above us in the league.\r\n\r\njust cos some chinese fella has bought you for a pittance and then claimed he's gonna spend 40mill in january? that doesn't make you a bigger club than newcastle lads, get some sodding perspective.\r\n\r\nwhen was the last time you played in europe, nevermind the champions league? when was the last time you got to a cup final?\r\n\r\nok, we might have won absolutely sod all for 50 year, but we've still done a hell of a lot more than birmingham chuffing city.\r\n\r\nnewsflash for yas as well: we know we were shite last year, we watched it."
