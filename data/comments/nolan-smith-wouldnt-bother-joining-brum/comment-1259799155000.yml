message: "Haha, you newcastle fans are a joke. You're forgetting that Sunderland FC are the biggest team in the North East, they've surpassed you, have a better manager than you, better players than you - and finally a better owner than you!\r\n\r\nNo way blues will be relegated, you defence might be holding its own in fizzy pop land but they aren't up to the job in superior league. \r\n\r\nYou can keep both your players ... im trying to recall what they did last year ... ahhhh - nothing!\r\n\r\nBowyer and carr just needed a little quality around them, they now have that at blues. No disrespect like but it was hardly you getting rid of bowyer - all ur decent players wanted to go ... Bowyer, Dyer, Solano, Given, Jenas, Milner .... thats without thinking too hard.\r\n\r\nDream on geordies ... ur now inferior to birmingham!!"
