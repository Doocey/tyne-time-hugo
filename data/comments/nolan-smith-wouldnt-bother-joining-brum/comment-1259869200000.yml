message: "My goodness that one took off like a rocket. What did we ever do before internet forums? Glad to see it's verbal fighting and none of that silly stuff on the terraces.\r\n\r\nI'll lay my cards on the table, I'm a Birmingham supporter. Not a Brummie but in fact a Silhillian. I think that both Nolan and Smith are credible players and I would certainly take both of them if we were shipping out Damian Johnson &amp;/or Lee Carsley otherwise the point of buying two players with medium sized wage packets would seemingly make little sense. Nolan would be an asset but then I hardly think he would have the wow factor that our new ownership would want, and I also think that Bowyer would take someone a lot better to replace him as on current form Lee is looking like a world beater. I appreciate that he didn't have such a good time in the north east but then I guess that happens to us all at some point. I'm glad that he now feels comfortable in Birmingham and playing alongside another surprisingly good player this season in Barry Ferguson.\r\n\r\nThe my club bigger than your argument is such a boring one. The only fact that really matters at the end of the season is where you finish and where you felt you would have liked to finish. The only negative and I'm sure it's a common and often made point about Newcastle, you are a one club City and that really does make a huge difference when Villa park is 2 miles, WBA 5 miles, (Walsall 12 miles), wolves 17 miles and Coventry 20 miles from St Andrews. Consider that the closest clubs to the Sports Direct Park are Sunderland at 10 miles and then as I can see it Hartlepool at 25 with middlesvilla just a bit further down the road. My point is that competition for football is not really an issue to the extent that it is for us. It's not an excuse more an observation. \r\n\r\nSuccess for Newcastle this year will most likely look like top of the pile and promotion sewn up in March/April, beware the championship has a nasty trick of biting you on the bum in the new year.\r\n\r\nSuccess for us was looking like 17th but I would imagine that with current form and the prospect of some acquisitions in January many a bluenose will be looking for top ten, although not silly enough to even think of Europe."
