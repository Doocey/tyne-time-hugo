  I used to work with a Newcastle fan, he was just the same as every Toon fan
  (Apart from 1) who has commented on here. He was seriously deluded. I am truly
  amazed that Newcastle fans claim there club is anything more than BCFC. We
  have both won fuck all. The leagues doesn't lie, at present Birmingham are
  doing better, we have a healthy future ahead, no debt, money to spend, better
  players and an ever rising moral among fans. The original article (Which is
  what we are supposed to be commenting on) is a complete load of utter tosh,
  its obviously written by another biased NUFC fan who probably put the whole
  article through microsoft word before posting it in order to make sure the
  spelling was correct. Why get so worked up?
