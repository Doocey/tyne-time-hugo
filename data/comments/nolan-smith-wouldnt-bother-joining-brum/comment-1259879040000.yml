message: "This is a load of Tosh but I'd like to make a few points.\r\n-Birmingham is probaly 5 times as big as Newcastle, and have 2 premieship clubs.The fan base is probably in that ratio- due to recent History they just dont go.\r\n- B'ham  are planning to build a new 55,000- 60,000 stadium -Fact\r\n- If Bham enjoy success they will fill the stadium.\r\n-Newcastle do not have a bigger fan base,they just currently have more fans who attend games. If Newcastle were to stay in the championship for 20yrs(Like Brum) then your gates would go down to the 7,000 you were pulling pre Keegan- FACT.\r\n-That Indian clown said Brum have never been in Europe.Brum have played in 2 European  finals, against Barcelona &amp; Roma. -Fact\r\n- I do consider Newcastle to be a big, at the moment, but if they do not get promoted this yr then it could be a slippery Leeds type slop."
