  right lets get a few things straight......newcastle united are apparently (so
  there fans keep saying) one of the biggest in english football.......newcastle
  united are are shit team and have been for years, fans are shit, players are
  shit and as for the running of the club it's a joke. nothing pleased me more
  than seeing newcastle get relagated last season at aston villa, seeing all
  those thick, fat geordie cunts crying was highly amusing.......yes birmingham
  are a new comer to the prem and probably won't sign nolan or smith but please
  newcastle get your heads out of your arses and admit your an average team and
  always will be.....in fact you've won about the same as
  birmingham..........fuck all!!!!
