message: "Brummies no offence, but you're going on a toon fansite.\r\nWhat the fuck do you expect?\r\nOf course it will be biased towards Newcastle, we fucking support them.\r\nAre you guys thick or something?\r\nThe clue is in the title... tynetime!\r\nBugger off to your own fansites where you'll probably post with just as much bias and propoganda drivel for your club.\r\n\r\nTo be honest though, you can't not say we're a big club when we do attract the 2nd or 3rd highest gates in the country on a weekend.\r\n\r\nThe definition of big is the size of something; not how successful it is at any given time. \r\nTherefore Newcastle are a big club, whether you like it or not!\r\nHonestly can any of you brummies not consult your Oxford English Dictionary before posting?"
