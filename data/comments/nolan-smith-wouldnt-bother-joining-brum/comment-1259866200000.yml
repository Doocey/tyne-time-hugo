message: "Controversial thread Doocey, well done.\r\n\r\nI'd guess out of 60+ replies that there's probably 5 different people posting. :)\r\n\r\nBirmingham are doing well this season and I think you have a good manager, good luck.\r\n\r\nUnbelievably after two of our worst seasons for years and relegation we still have attendances of over 40K. \r\n\r\nAfter years of having over paid underachievers @ SJP we have now lowered the wage bill quite conciderably and will do so again this summer with one or two more (thinking of Geremi for e.g.). We also have a sole owner who admittedly has loaned the club money but he cannot get it back until we are succesful again, it's not like he can realistically put us into receivership!\r\n\r\nNewcastle United have a huge fanbase (amazingly) still and for the first time in a few seasons we are able to enjoy winning games and yes we had to drop into the CCC league to do it, I do fear for next season if we are promoted as I'm not sure we'll have a good enough team to stay up and not convinced the owner will donate enough money to buy the players needed for us to stay up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Brummies, nice to see some comments here but tbh us GEORDIES are not all the same.\r\n\r\nGood luck guys."
