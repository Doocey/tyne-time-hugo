  I don't think it matters what any fans or even players think.  The bottom line
  is, the club owes over £100 Million to Ashley.  Ashley's own business isn't in
  a very healthy state, he can't find a buyer for the club, he's just had to put
  a further £20M of his own money in to keep the club running.  Birmingham are
  minted, so if they come in and make a sensible offer for any player, Ashley
  will find it really hard to resist.  Money talks.
