message: "This argument is utterly ridiculous... an argument is never going to be won and lost between 2 sets of football fans as they believe so strongly in their own cause...\r\nThe truth is, Newcastle are a poorly run club, and are currently relying on their own history to convince themselves that they are better, the truth is, we are in the championship for a reason, and the sooner we appreciate that this is a rebuilding process, the better. \r\nAs for Birmingham, it is awesome to see a club come into the premiership and do so well. I hate league when 3 teams come up and go straight back down again, it is not interesting.\r\nNolan does not need to revive his career, regardless of the league he is playing in he is is flourishing at the moment, and he is a joy to watch. If some of the Birmingham fans had watched him this season, they would see that he is not a has been like Bowyer and Carr both were, but he is an excellent player currently on top of his game. A move to Birmingham for him, however, would be senseless, if Newcastle carry on the way they are in the championship, they will back in the prem next year and whether either sets of fans like it, they will be in a similar position. \r\nGood luck Birmingham, i genuinely hope you stay up and consolidate."
