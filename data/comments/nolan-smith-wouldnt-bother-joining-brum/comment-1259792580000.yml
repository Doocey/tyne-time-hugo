message: "Oh Dear !\r\n\r\nIt would appear our Geordie relations still have ideas that they are a big club. Wake up lads - you are in the Fizzy Pop league at the moment or had you forgotton ? As for Nolan and Smith - no thanks. We are looking to push on not go backwards.\r\n\r\nSo you really think a club sitting mid-table at the beginning of december, with the 3rd best defence in the Prem and money to spend in January are a sure bet for relegation ? Have you not seen Wolves/Bolton/West Ham/portsmouth  play ? oh no, sorry I forgot, you're in a different division aren't you ! Silly me."
