  Since our new ownes foolishly announced we've got Â£40 million to spend in jan
  we've been linked with buying some real garbage players and i think getting
  linked with alan smith is the worst one so far.....HE'S SH*TE.Nolan on the
  other hand isn't a bad shout but we want to improve on our squad not by
  players similar to the standard that we already have.
