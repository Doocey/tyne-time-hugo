  Bazzer - Do you really think your club are anything special? You are seriously
  deluded if the answer is yes to that. What manager did you manage to attract
  last year? Oh yeah that idiot Kinnear. Replaced by Shearer....hmmm what's he
  doing now? Your current manager Chris Hughton.....hahaha. Small club!
