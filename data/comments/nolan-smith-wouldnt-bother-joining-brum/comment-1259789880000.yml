message: "A lot of 'no offence to Birmingham''s in your article.\r\n\r\nNo offence to Newcastle but you are no longer in the same league as Birmingham.\r\n\r\nGiven the way Bowyer is flourishing, I'd expect Nolan to be a useful addition to the squad - but Alan Smith - no thanks !\r\n\r\nIf you think Brum will be in the bottom 3 in May you are way off beam - we are way away of the relegation fodder which is still way away of the top of the Championship !"
