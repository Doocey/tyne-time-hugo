message: "Brucie, you try calling us Geordies thick, but you can't even punctuate properly.\r\nEver heard of paragraphs mate?\r\nAlso its you're not your in that context.\r\nMaybe if you were actually educated well, you would have seen sense and supported the only decent team in your city, Aston Villa.\r\n\r\nPlus what do you base your accusations of shit fans on?\r\nWe have a reputation for being the most loyal, friendly you can meet, ever been to St. James?\r\nIn fact ever even been to St Andrews?\r\nI bet you're just another armchair support having never owned a season ticket in your nothing of a life.\r\n\r\nYou honestly believe all the media drivel that is thrown at you by the London papers?\r\nWe don't ask for the coverage, in fact we all would prefer to rarely get a look in for news, except locally, a lot like yourselves do at the minute.\r\n\r\nAgain apart from a few rogue fans, who unfortunately get the exposure, we all admit we're an average club in terms of success, results don't lie and we're in the Championship at the moment on the back of this, but in terms of size you can't deny we are a big sized club, our attendances say it all.\r\n\r\nSince you don't have the capability to read through my previous post, here you go for a dictionary definition of big:\r\n\r\nbig\r\n\r\n  â€¢ adjective (bigger, biggest) 1 of considerable size, physical power, or extent. \r\n\r\nI'd say a club with a 52,000 stadium with an average attendance of 40,801 in the second tier is considered to be of considerable size, do you not think?\r\nEspecially considering it is a lot higher than your average attendance of 23,190 in the Premier League.\r\nI mean when was the last time Birmingham had an away crowd above 3000, never mind 5700 away to Barnsley of all teams?"
