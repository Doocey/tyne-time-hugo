message: "It could be a very good move for Nolan.  \r\n\r\nHe'll have noticed how Birmingham have helped Lee Bowyer and Stephen Carr rebuild their careers, which were both in ruins after they joined the footballers' graveyard that is Newcastle United.  If they can do it for Bowyer and Carr, they can do it for Nolan.\r\n\r\nAs for Smith?  He was rubbish even before he joined Newcastle, so I can't see there's any career there left to rebuild."
