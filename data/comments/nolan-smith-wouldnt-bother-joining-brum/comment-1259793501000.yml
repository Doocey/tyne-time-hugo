  Calm down brummies bloody hell. We have one season down here and we have a
  yoyo club trying to take the micky. Come back down to earth you are birmingham
  after all. You'll always be in villa's shadows you's are like what the mackems
  are up here, just enjoying ur very peak at mid-table prem. Only one way to go
  which is back down. Your just a small unfashionable club at best so remember
  that before u try and insult the mighty NUFC!
