  Just laughing at the comments, Newcastle are still bigger than alot of teams
  including sunderland, Sunderland might be better at the moment but that
  doesn't make them a bigger club! FACT! Newcastle have been unlucky with mike
  ashliegh screwing up the club! Hearts have took over too many idiots heads,
  Birmingham bigger than toon haha yeah good 1, I'm better than messi at
  football aswell
