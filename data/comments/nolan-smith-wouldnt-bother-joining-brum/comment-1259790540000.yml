message: "Very admirable but do you really think that if they get offered a chance to play back in the prem for a club who by jan could be comfortably mid table that they will stay at the sportsdirectchavoutfittersstadium@stjamespark.org.uk.lol or whatever your laughing stock owner has renamed your stadium? I think not. Nolan is a great midfielder and would fit very nicely into the new look Birmingham midfield that actually pass the ball forward. Good old mike will probably accept a cheeky 5mil no matter what chris h wants. Since when has Ashley given a monkeys about doing what is best for your club? \r\nAnyway you of coursenwill be back up next season but don't think for a second that your players really care about the club. They really don't.... And you can keep smith....\r\n\r\nIt's been nice having you lot in the chumpionship this year. I have been so happy that ssn have not gone to st james park for breaking news that 100,000 unemployed jordies have gathered outside the stadium be as someone said alan shearer had driven past or keegan had farted or whatever it is that gets you lot going... Nice to see shearer crawled back to the BBC at the end of last season though hey!!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe's not gfhe messiah, he's a very naughty boy."
