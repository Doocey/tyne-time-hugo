  I'll start by saying I'm a Newcastle fan. This article is ridiculous! I'll be
  suprised if Stephen Ireland features, nevermind plays. I'll let the Man U fan
  update you about Nolan. You might have had a point saying centre midfield is
  an area we can compete (with probably Tiote and Barton starting there) but you
  state our midfield is better than theirs? I take it you don't include wingers
  as midfielders? I'd imagine our midfield might be Jonas, Barton, Tiote, R
  Taylor (or possibly Guthrie with Barton RW). Theirs will be made up of
  Valencia, Park, Giggs, Carrick, Nani (correct me if I'm wrong) Do we really
  have a better mid?
