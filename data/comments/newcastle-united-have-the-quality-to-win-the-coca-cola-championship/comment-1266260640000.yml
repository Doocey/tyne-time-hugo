I take it you are not an NUFC fan?\r\n\r\nWinning the Championship means nothing. Winning promotion is all that counts. And Ashley selling a newly promoted nufc to someone with a modicum of ambition is something that we all should be praying for. I certainly am. \r\n\r\nFrom your post, it's hard to tell what *you* really want."
