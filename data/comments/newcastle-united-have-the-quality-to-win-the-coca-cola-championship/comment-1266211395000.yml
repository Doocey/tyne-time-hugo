message: "The current regime (or 'shower of sh*t', as most of us refer to them these days) may have done just enough in the last transfer window for us to to take one of the automatic promotion places, but this isn't an absolute certainty by any means.  \r\n\r\nAnd winning The Championship means absolutely nothing to anyone I know - this season's all about undoing the damage caused by the chubby chancer and his pal 'The Streak'.\r\n\r\nAs for your comments regarding the current wage bill at the club - are you seriously suggesting that we should be looking to offload players at the end of the season? Madness!"
