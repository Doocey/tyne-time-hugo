message: "buckblack:\r\n\r\njust too negative mate.  as ugly as our footy is at this time we are top of league and have been there all season too. i take it you are not a newcastle fan?\r\nIf you are a true nufc fan you need to get a grip mate, we are nothing more than a poor quality prem team at best and it is going to stay that way for a fair amount of time - until ashley sells up! \r\nWe are playing ugly footy though, that much i do agree on.  But i would rather have it that way and be top of the pile than play open attacking footy and not get promoted."
