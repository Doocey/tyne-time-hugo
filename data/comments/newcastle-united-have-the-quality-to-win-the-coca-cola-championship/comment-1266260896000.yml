  Can anyone remember how much shit Alex McLeish got at Birmingham last year for
  winning ugly?? The fans wanted him sacked even tho they were 2nd in the
  league! Look at them now, they are the only newly promoted team that look a
  decent Premier league outfit.  Some of us so called fans need to chill out a
  bit.  Our own 'fans' were in uproar because we struggled to a 2 - 0 win
  against Crystal Palace a few weeks back.  Anyone see Crystal Palace vs Aston
  Villa last nite??  Newcastle might be the best fans in the world but we are
  probably the most fickle as well.
