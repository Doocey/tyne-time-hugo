  When he comes off the bench he looks quick, strong and with a spring in his
  step and has destroyed teams e.g. spurs at home, bolton the other week, vs
  sunderland one a penalty and scored.


  When he starts hes just utterly hopeless. Reckon hes only got bout 30mins in
  him, but he is a very good option to have. People will slate him, but i cant
  think of a game where hes come off the bench and done nothing.
