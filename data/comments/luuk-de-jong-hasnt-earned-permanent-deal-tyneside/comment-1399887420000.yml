  yeah no way, the very fact anyone has paid over 12mil for this guy is
  embarrasing. i dont think he's a bad player, he's just struggled adapting to
  the type of football, much like cisse really. i wouldnt have any objection to
  him at 1 or 2 mil, but surely they'll want to recover at least half of that
  12, and at 6mil the price is just a laughable.
