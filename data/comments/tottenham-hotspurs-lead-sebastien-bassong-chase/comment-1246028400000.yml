message: "It's a tricky one. He's only had the one season with us (hasn't he?) and although he shone, he shone in our defence... could just be a blinding season for an average player in which case Â£10m plus is a very good deal.\r\nOn the other hand if we get promoted we'd be looking to buy a premiership-class defender anyway (probably) so selling him now might help in the short term (more funds for players) but hurt us in the long run (better chance of promotion with him and no need to splash more cash if we are).\r\nUltimately for me it comes down to the player, if he wants to go you have to let him or he won't put in the same effort, consciously or not."
