message: "Let's look positively at this scenario! we have the two best centre half's in the division. Does anyone else think that other than greed; killgallon's decision may have been partly due to the fact he would be sitting on the bench when colo and tayls are fit? \r\n\r\nWe have a fine up and coming central defender in Tamas Kadar. Let's bring Zurab back in until the end of the season on loan as cover for Tayls, collo and tamas. He can play full back as well so it will give us options. This would save us money to reinvest on a striker and a creative midfielder.\r\n\r\nI watched maynard play live at st. james this season and he did not get a sniff. If i recall it was zurab and stephen taylor playing central defence that day. I've seen far better attacking players at st. james this season.\r\n\r\nHe has pace; but for me the champioship is his level and i think all four of our first team strikers are better players; not to mention the fact bristol city value him in the 5 million and above bracket (as he has plebty of time to run on his contract).\r\n\r\nNot to beat the stick to much on it; but how about Joe Ledley? The best creative player in the division. Stoke city tried to buy him for 6 million in the summer. His contract runs out at the end of the current campaign and we would get him for a snip of that. 3-4 million pounds for a player who will thrive in the PL will be a bargain."
