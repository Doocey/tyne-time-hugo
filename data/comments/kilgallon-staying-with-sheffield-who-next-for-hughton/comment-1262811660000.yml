message: "Miles Addison should be next on the list. I know it was only one game but against us he was an absolute rock and looked knackered from lack of match practice but still made crazy runs up field from centre back. Every ball into the box Derby landed on his head. \r\n\r\nWould have liked Killgallon though. He is the best centre back there is in the Championship and it is most likely we will get someone on loan (not Khiz) so we dont have championship quality dead weight in the premiership."
