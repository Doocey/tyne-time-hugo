  I would suggest that, just because Kilgallon's agent says he is staying with
  Sheff Utd, doesn't necessarily mean he will.  How many times have we heard
  players and managers etc deny that there is any prospect of a move, only for
  the transfer to be completed a couple of days later?  The truth about transfer
  dealings is very rarely in the public domain until the deal has been done.
