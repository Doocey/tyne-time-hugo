message: "I'm a bit gutted really...\r\n\r\nKilgallon was the one player I wanted us to get this January, He's quite cultered and good on the ball, There aren't too many good central defenders available in England these days. I remember watching him on the first game of the season against the smoggies and he was a rock.\r\n\r\nTons of top quality  Championship defenders have gone on to be great in the premier league, Roger Johnson, Michael Dawson, Joleon Lescott, Phil Jagielka, James Collins, Michael Turner and Kilgallon is of the same mould as all of those...\r\n\r\nHopefully we can pick up someone else, Cleverley and Fryatt wouldn't go a miss either! :)"
