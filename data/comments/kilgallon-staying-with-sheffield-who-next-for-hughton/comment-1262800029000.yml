message: "I agree Northern Jedi, I too was at the Bristol City game earlier this season and Maynard didn't get a sniff. Taylor had him in his pocket all game.\r\n\r\nI'd take Ledley right now but he has struggled with injuries this season and thats the last thing we need..Maybe trying to seal a deal for Cleverley and or Ledley at the end of the season would be best."
