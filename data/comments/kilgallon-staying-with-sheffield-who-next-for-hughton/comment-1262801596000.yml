message: "Dooce - 'fraid I agree with icedog. I don't think Ashley would be paying over-the-odds for his wages, so he'll get significantly more by running down his contract. Combine that with the inevitability that he'll be behind Taylor and Colo, and that assuming the form continues, he could be for the rest of the season. The result for me would be that the agent has steered him toward the most lucrative deal for himself on that basis.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he doesn't have the desire to come and fight for his place, and maybe money talks.\r\n\r\nOr he could just genuinely want to stay at Sheff Utd. I think we all know that latter is the least likely, but it's the one the agent is harping on about, predictably."
