message: "Well if that is his decision, so be it.  We only want players desperate to come and play for us.  Let him negotiate a massive signing on fee to whoever he joins in the summer.  We have had more than enough money grabbers in our time and do not need another.  \r\n\r\nI think we now need to start blooding young Tamas Kadar a bit more and give him more first team experience.  From what I have seen of him, he has impressed me wth his vision, passing and he has pace too."
