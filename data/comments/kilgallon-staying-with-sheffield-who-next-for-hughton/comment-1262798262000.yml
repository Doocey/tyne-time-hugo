message: "To be fair Chris H may have a Plan B.  He has only just heard Killa's decision.  Let's see what happens next.  \r\non the Becks topic, I am with the guys who suggested looking at proven Championship goalscorers as possible alternatives.  Is Maynard promising?  I have not seen him but there is a wonderful touch of deja vu about signing Bristol City's centre forward as we power to promotion and then watch him break the Premiership goal scoring record.  Am I in the right century?\r\n\r\nHTL"
