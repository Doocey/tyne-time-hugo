  Looks as if the continuing uncertainty over the long term future of NUFC under
  Ashley's ownership and Hughton's management could be costing us signings. If
  Killgallon won't leave the Blades for the Toon despite us sitting comfortably
  at the top right now, it doesn't bode well for making those Prem quality
  signings we're gonna need (hopefully) come August.
