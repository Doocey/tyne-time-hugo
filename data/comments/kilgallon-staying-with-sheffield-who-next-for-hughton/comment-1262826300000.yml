message: "geordie foot soldier,i agree tamas kadar is very good on the ball,from what ive seen of him however in pre season against shamrock rovers he was a bit keen to pump it into row z and im not sure thats a good thing.\r\n\r\nthat said coloccini is one for showboating and i dont like that from a centre half either."
